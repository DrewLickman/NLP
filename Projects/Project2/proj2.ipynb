    "            - Resulting data will be augmented with \\<s> and </s>\n",
    "    - n-gram extraction should never cross over line boundaries\n",
    "- The data structure used to hold tokens in each sentence should start with \\<s> and end with </s>, according to the n-grams being processed\n",
    "    - Higher order n-grams require more start symbol augments\n",
    "- Unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, quadgrams will each be kept in separate data structures\n",
    "    - Dictionaries, indexed by \"context tuples\" work well for this\n",
    "- A parallel data structure should hold the counts of the tokens that immediately follow each n-gram context\n",
    "    - These counts should be stored as probabilities by dividing by total count of tokens that appear after the n-gram context \n",
    "- Process both files first using sentence level, then followed by paragraph level\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "- Set NumPy seed to 0\n",
    "- Print the count of extracted unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, and quadgrams (for each file)\n",
    "- For each file, choose a random starting word from the unigram tokens (not </s>)\n",
    "    - This random word will be used as the seed for generated n-gram texts\n",
    "- For each gram:\n",
    "    - Using the seed word (prefixed with \\<s> as required) generate either 150 tokens or until </s> is generated\n",
    "        - Do NOT continue after </s>\n",
    "    - Each next token will be probabilistically selected from those that follow the context (if any) for hat n-gram\n",
    "    - When working with higher order n-grams, use backoff when the context does not produce a token. Use the next lower n-gram"
