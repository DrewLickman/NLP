    "- Unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, quadgrams will each be kept in separate data structures\n",
    "    - Dictionaries, indexed by \"context tuples\" work well for this\n",
    "- A parallel data structure should hold the counts of the tokens that immediately follow each n-gram context\n",

    "    - This random word will be used as the seed for generated n-gram texts\n",
    "- For each gram:\n",
    "    - Using the seed word (prefixed with \\<s> as required) generate either 150 tokens or until </s> is generated\n",
    "        - Do NOT continue after </s>\n",
    "    - Each next token will be probabilistically selected from those that follow the context (if any) for hat n-gram\n",
    "    - When working with higher order n-grams, use backoff when the context does not produce a token. Use the next lower n-gram"
