  THE SONNETS                      1  From fairest creatures we desire increase, That thereby beauty’s rose might never die, But as the riper should by time decease, His tender heir might bear his memory: But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes, Feed’st thy light’s flame with self-substantial fuel, Making a famine where abundance lies, Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel: Thou that art now the world’s fresh ornament, And only herald to the gaudy spring, Within thine own bud buriest thy content, And, tender churl, mak’st waste in niggarding:   Pity the world, or else this glutton be,   To eat the world’s due, by the grave and thee.
When forty winters shall besiege thy brow, And dig deep trenches in thy beauty’s field, Thy youth’s proud livery so gazed on now, Will be a tattered weed of small worth held: Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies, Where all the treasure of thy lusty days; To say, within thine own deep sunken eyes, Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise. How much more praise deserv’d thy beauty’s use, If thou couldst answer ‘This fair child of mine Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse,’ Proving his beauty by succession thine.   This were to be new made when thou art old,   And see thy blood warm when thou feel’st it cold.
Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest, Now is the time that face should form another, Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest, Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother. For where is she so fair whose uneared womb Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry? Or who is he so fond will be the tomb Of his self-love to stop posterity? Thou art thy mother’s glass and she in thee Calls back the lovely April of her prime, So thou through windows of thine age shalt see, Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.   But if thou live remembered not to be,   Die single and thine image dies with thee.
Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend, Upon thyself thy beauty’s legacy? Nature’s bequest gives nothing but doth lend, And being frank she lends to those are free: Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse, The bounteous largess given thee to give? Profitless usurer why dost thou use So great a sum of sums yet canst not live? For having traffic with thyself alone, Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive, Then how when nature calls thee to be gone, What acceptable audit canst thou leave?   Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,   Which used lives th’ executor to be.
Those hours that with gentle work did frame The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell Will play the tyrants to the very same, And that unfair which fairly doth excel: For never-resting time leads summer on To hideous winter and confounds him there, Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone, Beauty o’er-snowed and bareness every where: Then were not summer’s distillation left A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass, Beauty’s effect with beauty were bereft, Nor it nor no remembrance what it was.   But flowers distilled though they with winter meet,   Leese but their show, their substance still lives sweet.
Then let not winter’s ragged hand deface, In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled: Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place, With beauty’s treasure ere it be self-killed: That use is not forbidden usury, Which happies those that pay the willing loan; That’s for thyself to breed another thee, Or ten times happier be it ten for one, Ten times thyself were happier than thou art, If ten of thine ten times refigured thee: Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart, Leaving thee living in posterity?   Be not self-willed for thou art much too fair,   To be death’s conquest and make worms thine heir.
Lo in the orient when the gracious light Lifts up his burning head, each under eye Doth homage to his new-appearing sight, Serving with looks his sacred majesty, And having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill, Resembling strong youth in his middle age, Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still, Attending on his golden pilgrimage: But when from highmost pitch with weary car, Like feeble age he reeleth from the day, The eyes (fore duteous) now converted are From his low tract and look another way:   So thou, thyself out-going in thy noon:   Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son.
Music to hear, why hear’st thou music sadly? Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy: Why lov’st thou that which thou receiv’st not gladly, Or else receiv’st with pleasure thine annoy? If the true concord of well-tuned sounds, By unions married do offend thine ear, They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear: Mark how one string sweet husband to another, Strikes each in each by mutual ordering; Resembling sire, and child, and happy mother, Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:   Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,   Sings this to thee, ‘Thou single wilt prove none’.
Is it for fear to wet a widow’s eye, That thou consum’st thyself in single life? Ah, if thou issueless shalt hap to die, The world will wail thee like a makeless wife, The world will be thy widow and still weep, That thou no form of thee hast left behind, When every private widow well may keep, By children’s eyes, her husband’s shape in mind: Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it; But beauty’s waste hath in the world an end, And kept unused the user so destroys it:   No love toward others in that bosom sits   That on himself such murd’rous shame commits.
For shame deny that thou bear’st love to any Who for thyself art so unprovident. Grant if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many, But that thou none lov’st is most evident: For thou art so possessed with murd’rous hate, That ’gainst thyself thou stick’st not to conspire, Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate Which to repair should be thy chief desire: O change thy thought, that I may change my mind, Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love? Be as thy presence is gracious and kind, Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove,   Make thee another self for love of me,   That beauty still may live in thine or thee.
As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow’st, In one of thine, from that which thou departest, And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow’st, Thou mayst call thine, when thou from youth convertest, Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase, Without this folly, age, and cold decay, If all were minded so, the times should cease, And threescore year would make the world away: Let those whom nature hath not made for store, Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish: Look whom she best endowed, she gave thee more; Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:   She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby,   Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.
When I do count the clock that tells the time, And see the brave day sunk in hideous night, When I behold the violet past prime, And sable curls all silvered o’er with white: When lofty trees I see barren of leaves, Which erst from heat did canopy the herd And summer’s green all girded up in sheaves Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard: Then of thy beauty do I question make That thou among the wastes of time must go, Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake, And die as fast as they see others grow,   And nothing ’gainst Time’s scythe can make defence   Save breed to brave him, when he takes thee hence.
O that you were your self, but love you are No longer yours, than you yourself here live, Against this coming end you should prepare, And your sweet semblance to some other give. So should that beauty which you hold in lease Find no determination, then you were Yourself again after yourself’s decease, When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear. Who lets so fair a house fall to decay, Which husbandry in honour might uphold, Against the stormy gusts of winter’s day And barren rage of death’s eternal cold?   O none but unthrifts, dear my love you know,   You had a father, let your son say so.
Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck, And yet methinks I have astronomy, But not to tell of good, or evil luck, Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons’ quality, Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell; Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind, Or say with princes if it shall go well By oft predict that I in heaven find. But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive, And constant stars in them I read such art As truth and beauty shall together thrive If from thyself, to store thou wouldst convert:   Or else of thee this I prognosticate,   Thy end is truth’s and beauty’s doom and date.
When I consider everything that grows Holds in perfection but a little moment. That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows Whereon the stars in secret influence comment. When I perceive that men as plants increase, Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky: Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease, And wear their brave state out of memory. Then the conceit of this inconstant stay, Sets you most rich in youth before my sight, Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay To change your day of youth to sullied night,   And all in war with Time for love of you,   As he takes from you, I engraft you new.
But wherefore do not you a mightier way Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time? And fortify yourself in your decay With means more blessed than my barren rhyme? Now stand you on the top of happy hours, And many maiden gardens yet unset, With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers, Much liker than your painted counterfeit: So should the lines of life that life repair Which this (Time’s pencil) or my pupil pen Neither in inward worth nor outward fair Can make you live yourself in eyes of men.   To give away yourself, keeps yourself still,   And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill.
Who will believe my verse in time to come If it were filled with your most high deserts? Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts: If I could write the beauty of your eyes, And in fresh numbers number all your graces, The age to come would say this poet lies, Such heavenly touches ne’er touched earthly faces. So should my papers (yellowed with their age) Be scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue, And your true rights be termed a poet’s rage, And stretched metre of an antique song.   But were some child of yours alive that time,   You should live twice,—in it, and in my rhyme.
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate: Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, And summer’s lease hath all too short a date: Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, And often is his gold complexion dimmed, And every fair from fair sometime declines, By chance, or nature’s changing course untrimmed: But thy eternal summer shall not fade, Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st, Nor shall death brag thou wand’rest in his shade, When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st,   So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,   So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
Devouring Time blunt thou the lion’s paws, And make the earth devour her own sweet brood, Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger’s jaws, And burn the long-lived phoenix, in her blood, Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet’st, And do whate’er thou wilt swift-footed Time To the wide world and all her fading sweets: But I forbid thee one most heinous crime, O carve not with thy hours my love’s fair brow, Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen, Him in thy course untainted do allow, For beauty’s pattern to succeeding men.   Yet do thy worst, old Time; despite thy wrong,   My love shall in my verse ever live young.
A woman’s face with nature’s own hand painted, Hast thou the master mistress of my passion, A woman’s gentle heart but not acquainted With shifting change as is false women’s fashion, An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling: Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth, A man in hue all hues in his controlling, Which steals men’s eyes and women’s souls amazeth. And for a woman wert thou first created, Till nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting, And by addition me of thee defeated, By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.   But since she pricked thee out for women’s pleasure,   Mine be thy love and thy love’s use their treasure.
So is it not with me as with that muse, Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse, Who heaven it self for ornament doth use, And every fair with his fair doth rehearse, Making a couplement of proud compare With sun and moon, with earth and sea’s rich gems: With April’s first-born flowers and all things rare, That heaven’s air in this huge rondure hems. O let me true in love but truly write, And then believe me, my love is as fair, As any mother’s child, though not so bright As those gold candles fixed in heaven’s air:   Let them say more that like of hearsay well,   I will not praise that purpose not to sell.
Let those who are in favour with their stars, Of public honour and proud titles boast, Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars Unlooked for joy in that I honour most; Great princes’ favourites their fair leaves spread, But as the marigold at the sun’s eye, And in themselves their pride lies buried, For at a frown they in their glory die. The painful warrior famoused for fight, After a thousand victories once foiled, Is from the book of honour razed quite, And all the rest forgot for which he toiled:   Then happy I that love and am beloved   Where I may not remove nor be removed.
Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit; To thee I send this written embassage To witness duty, not to show my wit. Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it; But that I hope some good conceit of thine In thy soul’s thought (all naked) will bestow it: Till whatsoever star that guides my moving, Points on me graciously with fair aspect, And puts apparel on my tattered loving, To show me worthy of thy sweet respect,   Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee,   Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.
Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed, The dear respose for limbs with travel tired, But then begins a journey in my head To work my mind, when body’s work’s expired. For then my thoughts, from far where I abide, Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee, And keep my drooping eyelids open wide, Looking on darkness which the blind do see. Save that my soul’s imaginary sight Presents thy shadow to my sightless view, Which like a jewel (hung in ghastly night) Makes black night beauteous, and her old face new.   Lo thus by day my limbs, by night my mind,   For thee, and for my self, no quiet find.
How can I then return in happy plight That am debarred the benefit of rest? When day’s oppression is not eased by night, But day by night and night by day oppressed. And each (though enemies to either’s reign) Do in consent shake hands to torture me, The one by toil, the other to complain How far I toil, still farther off from thee. I tell the day to please him thou art bright, And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven: So flatter I the swart-complexioned night, When sparkling stars twire not thou gild’st the even.   But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,   And night doth nightly make grief’s length seem stronger
When in disgrace with fortune and men’s eyes, I all alone beweep my outcast state, And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries, And look upon my self and curse my fate, Wishing me like to one more rich in hope, Featured like him, like him with friends possessed, Desiring this man’s art, and that man’s scope, With what I most enjoy contented least, Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising, Haply I think on thee, and then my state, (Like to the lark at break of day arising From sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven’s gate,   For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings,   That then I scorn to change my state with kings.
When to the sessions of sweet silent thought, I summon up remembrance of things past, I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought, And with old woes new wail my dear time’s waste: Then can I drown an eye (unused to flow) For precious friends hid in death’s dateless night, And weep afresh love’s long since cancelled woe, And moan th’ expense of many a vanished sight. Then can I grieve at grievances foregone, And heavily from woe to woe tell o’er The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan, Which I new pay as if not paid before.   But if the while I think on thee (dear friend)   All losses are restored, and sorrows end.
Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts, Which I by lacking have supposed dead, And there reigns love and all love’s loving parts, And all those friends which I thought buried. How many a holy and obsequious tear Hath dear religious love stol’n from mine eye, As interest of the dead, which now appear, But things removed that hidden in thee lie. Thou art the grave where buried love doth live, Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone, Who all their parts of me to thee did give, That due of many, now is thine alone.   Their images I loved, I view in thee,   And thou, all they, hast all the all of me.
If thou survive my well-contented day, When that churl death my bones with dust shall cover And shalt by fortune once more re-survey These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover: Compare them with the bett’ring of the time, And though they be outstripped by every pen, Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme, Exceeded by the height of happier men. O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought, ’Had my friend’s Muse grown with this growing age, A dearer birth than this his love had brought To march in ranks of better equipage:   But since he died and poets better prove,   Theirs for their style I’ll read, his for his love’.
Full many a glorious morning have I seen, Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye, Kissing with golden face the meadows green; Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy: Anon permit the basest clouds to ride, With ugly rack on his celestial face, And from the forlorn world his visage hide Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace: Even so my sun one early morn did shine, With all triumphant splendour on my brow, But out alack, he was but one hour mine, The region cloud hath masked him from me now.   Yet him for this, my love no whit disdaineth,   Suns of the world may stain, when heaven’s sun staineth.
Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day, And make me travel forth without my cloak, To let base clouds o’ertake me in my way, Hiding thy brav’ry in their rotten smoke? ’Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break, To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face, For no man well of such a salve can speak, That heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace: Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief, Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss, Th’ offender’s sorrow lends but weak relief To him that bears the strong offence’s cross.   Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,   And they are rich, and ransom all ill deeds.
No more be grieved at that which thou hast done, Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud, Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun, And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud. All men make faults, and even I in this, Authorizing thy trespass with compare, My self corrupting salving thy amiss, Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are: For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense; Thy adverse party is thy advocate, And ’gainst my self a lawful plea commence: Such civil war is in my love and hate,   That I an accessary needs must be,   To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.
Let me confess that we two must be twain, Although our undivided loves are one: So shall those blots that do with me remain, Without thy help, by me be borne alone. In our two loves there is but one respect, Though in our lives a separable spite, Which though it alter not love’s sole effect, Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love’s delight. I may not evermore acknowledge thee, Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame, Nor thou with public kindness honour me, Unless thou take that honour from thy name:   But do not so, I love thee in such sort,   As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.
As a decrepit father takes delight, To see his active child do deeds of youth, So I, made lame by Fortune’s dearest spite Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth. For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit, Or any of these all, or all, or more Entitled in thy parts, do crowned sit, I make my love engrafted to this store: So then I am not lame, poor, nor despised, Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give, That I in thy abundance am sufficed, And by a part of all thy glory live:   Look what is best, that best I wish in thee,   This wish I have, then ten times happy me.
How can my Muse want subject to invent While thou dost breathe that pour’st into my verse, Thine own sweet argument, too excellent, For every vulgar paper to rehearse? O give thyself the thanks if aught in me, Worthy perusal stand against thy sight, For who’s so dumb that cannot write to thee, When thou thyself dost give invention light? Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth Than those old nine which rhymers invocate, And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth Eternal numbers to outlive long date.   If my slight Muse do please these curious days,   The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.
O how thy worth with manners may I sing, When thou art all the better part of me? What can mine own praise to mine own self bring: And what is’t but mine own when I praise thee? Even for this, let us divided live, And our dear love lose name of single one, That by this separation I may give: That due to thee which thou deserv’st alone: O absence what a torment wouldst thou prove, Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave, To entertain the time with thoughts of love, Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive.   And that thou teachest how to make one twain,   By praising him here who doth hence remain.
Take all my loves, my love, yea take them all, What hast thou then more than thou hadst before? No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call, All mine was thine, before thou hadst this more: Then if for my love, thou my love receivest, I cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest, But yet be blamed, if thou thyself deceivest By wilful taste of what thyself refusest. I do forgive thy robbery gentle thief Although thou steal thee all my poverty: And yet love knows it is a greater grief To bear greater wrong, than hate’s known injury.   Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,   Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes.
Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits, When I am sometime absent from thy heart, Thy beauty, and thy years full well befits, For still temptation follows where thou art. Gentle thou art, and therefore to be won, Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assailed. And when a woman woos, what woman’s son, Will sourly leave her till he have prevailed? Ay me, but yet thou mightst my seat forbear, And chide thy beauty, and thy straying youth, Who lead thee in their riot even there Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth:   Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,   Thine by thy beauty being false to me.
That thou hast her it is not all my grief, And yet it may be said I loved her dearly, That she hath thee is of my wailing chief, A loss in love that touches me more nearly. Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye, Thou dost love her, because thou know’st I love her, And for my sake even so doth she abuse me, Suff’ring my friend for my sake to approve her. If I lose thee, my loss is my love’s gain, And losing her, my friend hath found that loss, Both find each other, and I lose both twain, And both for my sake lay on me this cross,   But here’s the joy, my friend and I are one,   Sweet flattery, then she loves but me alone.
When most I wink then do mine eyes best see, For all the day they view things unrespected, But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee, And darkly bright, are bright in dark directed. Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright How would thy shadow’s form, form happy show, To the clear day with thy much clearer light, When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so! How would (I say) mine eyes be blessed made, By looking on thee in the living day, When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade, Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!   All days are nights to see till I see thee,   And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.
If the dull substance of my flesh were thought, Injurious distance should not stop my way, For then despite of space I would be brought, From limits far remote, where thou dost stay, No matter then although my foot did stand Upon the farthest earth removed from thee, For nimble thought can jump both sea and land, As soon as think the place where he would be. But ah, thought kills me that I am not thought To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone, But that so much of earth and water wrought, I must attend, time’s leisure with my moan.   Receiving nought by elements so slow,   But heavy tears, badges of either’s woe.
The other two, slight air, and purging fire, Are both with thee, wherever I abide, The first my thought, the other my desire, These present-absent with swift motion slide. For when these quicker elements are gone In tender embassy of love to thee, My life being made of four, with two alone, Sinks down to death, oppressed with melancholy. Until life’s composition be recured, By those swift messengers returned from thee, Who even but now come back again assured, Of thy fair health, recounting it to me.   This told, I joy, but then no longer glad,   I send them back again and straight grow sad.
Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war, How to divide the conquest of thy sight, Mine eye, my heart thy picture’s sight would bar, My heart, mine eye the freedom of that right, My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie, A closet never pierced with crystal eyes; But the defendant doth that plea deny, And says in him thy fair appearance lies. To side this title is impanelled A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart, And by their verdict is determined The clear eye’s moiety, and the dear heart’s part.   As thus, mine eye’s due is thy outward part,   And my heart’s right, thy inward love of heart.
Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took, And each doth good turns now unto the other, When that mine eye is famished for a look, Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother; With my love’s picture then my eye doth feast, And to the painted banquet bids my heart: Another time mine eye is my heart’s guest, And in his thoughts of love doth share a part. So either by thy picture or my love, Thyself away, art present still with me, For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move, And I am still with them, and they with thee.   Or if they sleep, thy picture in my sight   Awakes my heart, to heart’s and eye’s delight.
Against that time (if ever that time come) When I shall see thee frown on my defects, When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum, Called to that audit by advised respects, Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass, And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye, When love converted from the thing it was Shall reasons find of settled gravity; Against that time do I ensconce me here Within the knowledge of mine own desert, And this my hand, against my self uprear, To guard the lawful reasons on thy part,   To leave poor me, thou hast the strength of laws,   Since why to love, I can allege no cause.
How heavy do I journey on the way, When what I seek (my weary travel’s end) Doth teach that case and that repose to say ’Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend.’ The beast that bears me, tired with my woe, Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me, As if by some instinct the wretch did know His rider loved not speed being made from thee: The bloody spur cannot provoke him on, That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide, Which heavily he answers with a groan, More sharp to me than spurring to his side,   For that same groan doth put this in my mind,   My grief lies onward and my joy behind.
Thus can my love excuse the slow offence, Of my dull bearer, when from thee I speed, From where thou art, why should I haste me thence? Till I return of posting is no need. O what excuse will my poor beast then find, When swift extremity can seem but slow? Then should I spur though mounted on the wind, In winged speed no motion shall I know, Then can no horse with my desire keep pace, Therefore desire (of perfect’st love being made) Shall neigh no dull flesh in his fiery race, But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade:   Since from thee going, he went wilful-slow,   Towards thee I’ll run, and give him leave to go.
So am I as the rich whose blessed key, Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure, The which he will not every hour survey, For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure. Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare, Since seldom coming in that long year set, Like stones of worth they thinly placed are, Or captain jewels in the carcanet. So is the time that keeps you as my chest Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide, To make some special instant special-blest, By new unfolding his imprisoned pride.   Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope,   Being had to triumph, being lacked to hope.
What is your substance, whereof are you made, That millions of strange shadows on you tend? Since every one, hath every one, one shade, And you but one, can every shadow lend: Describe Adonis and the counterfeit, Is poorly imitated after you, On Helen’s cheek all art of beauty set, And you in Grecian tires are painted new: Speak of the spring, and foison of the year, The one doth shadow of your beauty show, The other as your bounty doth appear, And you in every blessed shape we know.   In all external grace you have some part,   But you like none, none you for constant heart.
O how much more doth beauty beauteous seem, By that sweet ornament which truth doth give! The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem For that sweet odour, which doth in it live: The canker blooms have full as deep a dye, As the perfumed tincture of the roses, Hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly, When summer’s breath their masked buds discloses: But for their virtue only is their show, They live unwooed, and unrespected fade, Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so, Of their sweet deaths, are sweetest odours made:   And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,   When that shall fade, my verse distills your truth.
Not marble, nor the gilded monuments Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme, But you shall shine more bright in these contents Than unswept stone, besmeared with sluttish time. When wasteful war shall statues overturn, And broils root out the work of masonry, Nor Mars his sword, nor war’s quick fire shall burn: The living record of your memory. ’Gainst death, and all-oblivious enmity Shall you pace forth, your praise shall still find room, Even in the eyes of all posterity That wear this world out to the ending doom.   So till the judgement that yourself arise,   You live in this, and dwell in lovers’ eyes.
Sweet love renew thy force, be it not said Thy edge should blunter be than appetite, Which but to-day by feeding is allayed, To-morrow sharpened in his former might. So love be thou, although to-day thou fill Thy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness, To-morrow see again, and do not kill The spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness: Let this sad interim like the ocean be Which parts the shore, where two contracted new, Come daily to the banks, that when they see: Return of love, more blest may be the view.   Or call it winter, which being full of care,   Makes summer’s welcome, thrice more wished, more rare.
Being your slave what should I do but tend, Upon the hours, and times of your desire? I have no precious time at all to spend; Nor services to do till you require. Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour, Whilst I (my sovereign) watch the clock for you, Nor think the bitterness of absence sour, When you have bid your servant once adieu. Nor dare I question with my jealous thought, Where you may be, or your affairs suppose, But like a sad slave stay and think of nought Save where you are, how happy you make those.   So true a fool is love, that in your will,   (Though you do any thing) he thinks no ill.
That god forbid, that made me first your slave, I should in thought control your times of pleasure, Or at your hand th’ account of hours to crave, Being your vassal bound to stay your leisure. O let me suffer (being at your beck) Th’ imprisoned absence of your liberty, And patience tame to sufferance bide each check, Without accusing you of injury. Be where you list, your charter is so strong, That you yourself may privilage your time To what you will, to you it doth belong, Yourself to pardon of self-doing crime.   I am to wait, though waiting so be hell,   Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well.
If there be nothing new, but that which is, Hath been before, how are our brains beguiled, Which labouring for invention bear amiss The second burthen of a former child! O that record could with a backward look, Even of five hundred courses of the sun, Show me your image in some antique book, Since mind at first in character was done. That I might see what the old world could say, To this composed wonder of your frame, Whether we are mended, or whether better they, Or whether revolution be the same.   O sure I am the wits of former days,   To subjects worse have given admiring praise.
Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore, So do our minutes hasten to their end, Each changing place with that which goes before, In sequent toil all forwards do contend. Nativity once in the main of light, Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crowned, Crooked eclipses ’gainst his glory fight, And Time that gave, doth now his gift confound. Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth, And delves the parallels in beauty’s brow, Feeds on the rarities of nature’s truth, And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow.   And yet to times in hope, my verse shall stand   Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.
Is it thy will, thy image should keep open My heavy eyelids to the weary night? Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken, While shadows like to thee do mock my sight? Is it thy spirit that thou send’st from thee So far from home into my deeds to pry, To find out shames and idle hours in me, The scope and tenure of thy jealousy? O no, thy love though much, is not so great, It is my love that keeps mine eye awake, Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat, To play the watchman ever for thy sake.   For thee watch I, whilst thou dost wake elsewhere,   From me far off, with others all too near.
Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye, And all my soul, and all my every part; And for this sin there is no remedy, It is so grounded inward in my heart. Methinks no face so gracious is as mine, No shape so true, no truth of such account, And for my self mine own worth do define, As I all other in all worths surmount. But when my glass shows me my self indeed beated and chopt with tanned antiquity, Mine own self-love quite contrary I read: Self, so self-loving were iniquity.   ’Tis thee, myself, that for myself I praise,   Painting my age with beauty of thy days.
Against my love shall be as I am now With Time’s injurious hand crushed and o’erworn, When hours have drained his blood and filled his brow With lines and wrinkles, when his youthful morn Hath travelled on to age’s steepy night, And all those beauties whereof now he’s king Are vanishing, or vanished out of sight, Stealing away the treasure of his spring: For such a time do I now fortify Against confounding age’s cruel knife, That he shall never cut from memory My sweet love’s beauty, though my lover’s life.   His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,   And they shall live, and he in them still green.
When I have seen by Time’s fell hand defaced The rich-proud cost of outworn buried age, When sometime lofty towers I see down-rased, And brass eternal slave to mortal rage. When I have seen the hungry ocean gain Advantage on the kingdom of the shore, And the firm soil win of the watery main, Increasing store with loss, and loss with store. When I have seen such interchange of State, Or state it self confounded, to decay, Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate: That Time will come and take my love away.   This thought is as a death which cannot choose   But weep to have, that which it fears to lose.
Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea, But sad mortality o’ersways their power, How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea, Whose action is no stronger than a flower? O how shall summer’s honey breath hold out, Against the wrackful siege of batt’ring days, When rocks impregnable are not so stout, Nor gates of steel so strong but time decays? O fearful meditation, where alack, Shall Time’s best jewel from Time’s chest lie hid? Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back, Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?   O none, unless this miracle have might,   That in black ink my love may still shine bright.
Tired with all these, for restful death I cry: As to behold desert a beggar born, And needy nothing trimmed in jollity, And purest faith unhappily forsworn, And gilded honour shamefully misplaced, And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted, And right perfection wrongfully disgraced, And strength by limping sway disabled And art made tongue-tied by authority, And folly, doctor-like, controlling skill, And simple truth miscalled simplicity, And captive good attending captain ill.   Tired with all these, from these would I be gone,   Save that to die, I leave my love alone.
Ah wherefore with infection should he live, And with his presence grace impiety, That sin by him advantage should achieve, And lace it self with his society? Why should false painting imitate his cheek, And steal dead seeming of his living hue? Why should poor beauty indirectly seek, Roses of shadow, since his rose is true? Why should he live, now nature bankrupt is, Beggared of blood to blush through lively veins, For she hath no exchequer now but his, And proud of many, lives upon his gains?   O him she stores, to show what wealth she had,   In days long since, before these last so bad.
Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn, When beauty lived and died as flowers do now, Before these bastard signs of fair were born, Or durst inhabit on a living brow: Before the golden tresses of the dead, The right of sepulchres, were shorn away, To live a second life on second head, Ere beauty’s dead fleece made another gay: In him those holy antique hours are seen, Without all ornament, it self and true, Making no summer of another’s green, Robbing no old to dress his beauty new,   And him as for a map doth Nature store,   To show false Art what beauty was of yore.
Those parts of thee that the world’s eye doth view, Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend: All tongues, the voice of souls, give thee that due, Uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend. Thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned, But those same tongues that give thee so thine own, In other accents do this praise confound By seeing farther than the eye hath shown. They look into the beauty of thy mind, And that in guess they measure by thy deeds, Then churls their thoughts (although their eyes were kind) To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:   But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,   The soil is this, that thou dost common grow.
That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect, For slander’s mark was ever yet the fair, The ornament of beauty is suspect, A crow that flies in heaven’s sweetest air. So thou be good, slander doth but approve, Thy worth the greater being wooed of time, For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love, And thou present’st a pure unstained prime. Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days, Either not assailed, or victor being charged, Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise, To tie up envy, evermore enlarged,   If some suspect of ill masked not thy show,   Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.
No longer mourn for me when I am dead, Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell Give warning to the world that I am fled From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell: Nay if you read this line, remember not, The hand that writ it, for I love you so, That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot, If thinking on me then should make you woe. O if, I say, you look upon this verse, When I (perhaps) compounded am with clay, Do not so much as my poor name rehearse; But let your love even with my life decay.   Lest the wise world should look into your moan,   And mock you with me after I am gone.
O lest the world should task you to recite, What merit lived in me that you should love After my death, dear love, forget me quite, For you in me can nothing worthy prove. Unless you would devise some virtuous lie, To do more for me than mine own desert, And hang more praise upon deceased I, Than niggard truth would willingly impart: O lest your true love may seem false in this, That you for love speak well of me untrue, My name be buried where my body is, And live no more to shame nor me, nor you.   For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,   And so should you, to love things nothing worth.
That time of year thou mayst in me behold, When yellow leaves, or none, or few do hang Upon those boughs which shake against the cold, Bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang. In me thou seest the twilight of such day, As after sunset fadeth in the west, Which by and by black night doth take away, Death’s second self that seals up all in rest. In me thou seest the glowing of such fire, That on the ashes of his youth doth lie, As the death-bed, whereon it must expire, Consumed with that which it was nourished by.   This thou perceiv’st, which makes thy love more strong,   To love that well, which thou must leave ere long.
But be contented when that fell arrest, Without all bail shall carry me away, My life hath in this line some interest, Which for memorial still with thee shall stay. When thou reviewest this, thou dost review, The very part was consecrate to thee, The earth can have but earth, which is his due, My spirit is thine the better part of me, So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life, The prey of worms, my body being dead, The coward conquest of a wretch’s knife, Too base of thee to be remembered,   The worth of that, is that which it contains,   And that is this, and this with thee remains.
So are you to my thoughts as food to life, Or as sweet-seasoned showers are to the ground; And for the peace of you I hold such strife As ’twixt a miser and his wealth is found. Now proud as an enjoyer, and anon Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure, Now counting best to be with you alone, Then bettered that the world may see my pleasure, Sometime all full with feasting on your sight, And by and by clean starved for a look, Possessing or pursuing no delight Save what is had, or must from you be took.   Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,   Or gluttoning on all, or all away.
Why is my verse so barren of new pride? So far from variation or quick change? Why with the time do I not glance aside To new-found methods, and to compounds strange? Why write I still all one, ever the same, And keep invention in a noted weed, That every word doth almost tell my name, Showing their birth, and where they did proceed? O know sweet love I always write of you, And you and love are still my argument: So all my best is dressing old words new, Spending again what is already spent:   For as the sun is daily new and old,   So is my love still telling what is told.
Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear, Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste, These vacant leaves thy mind’s imprint will bear, And of this book, this learning mayst thou taste. The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show, Of mouthed graves will give thee memory, Thou by thy dial’s shady stealth mayst know, Time’s thievish progress to eternity. Look what thy memory cannot contain, Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find Those children nursed, delivered from thy brain, To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.   These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,   Shall profit thee, and much enrich thy book.
So oft have I invoked thee for my muse, And found such fair assistance in my verse, As every alien pen hath got my use, And under thee their poesy disperse. Thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing, And heavy ignorance aloft to fly, Have added feathers to the learned’s wing, And given grace a double majesty. Yet be most proud of that which I compile, Whose influence is thine, and born of thee, In others’ works thou dost but mend the style, And arts with thy sweet graces graced be.   But thou art all my art, and dost advance   As high as learning, my rude ignorance.
Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid, My verse alone had all thy gentle grace, But now my gracious numbers are decayed, And my sick muse doth give an other place. I grant (sweet love) thy lovely argument Deserves the travail of a worthier pen, Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent, He robs thee of, and pays it thee again, He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word, From thy behaviour, beauty doth he give And found it in thy cheek: he can afford No praise to thee, but what in thee doth live.   Then thank him not for that which he doth say,   Since what he owes thee, thou thyself dost pay.
O how I faint when I of you do write, Knowing a better spirit doth use your name, And in the praise thereof spends all his might, To make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame. But since your worth, wide as the ocean is, The humble as the proudest sail doth bear, My saucy bark (inferior far to his) On your broad main doth wilfully appear. Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat, Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride, Or (being wrecked) I am a worthless boat, He of tall building, and of goodly pride.   Then if he thrive and I be cast away,   The worst was this: my love was my decay.
Or I shall live your epitaph to make, Or you survive when I in earth am rotten, From hence your memory death cannot take, Although in me each part will be forgotten. Your name from hence immortal life shall have, Though I (once gone) to all the world must die, The earth can yield me but a common grave, When you entombed in men’s eyes shall lie, Your monument shall be my gentle verse, Which eyes not yet created shall o’er-read, And tongues to be, your being shall rehearse, When all the breathers of this world are dead,   You still shall live, such virtue hath my pen,   Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.
I grant thou wert not married to my muse, And therefore mayst without attaint o’erlook The dedicated words which writers use Of their fair subject, blessing every book. Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue, Finding thy worth a limit past my praise, And therefore art enforced to seek anew, Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days. And do so love, yet when they have devised, What strained touches rhetoric can lend, Thou truly fair, wert truly sympathized, In true plain words, by thy true-telling friend.   And their gross painting might be better used,   Where cheeks need blood, in thee it is abused.
I never saw that you did painting need, And therefore to your fair no painting set, I found (or thought I found) you did exceed, That barren tender of a poet’s debt: And therefore have I slept in your report, That you yourself being extant well might show, How far a modern quill doth come too short, Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow. This silence for my sin you did impute, Which shall be most my glory being dumb, For I impair not beauty being mute, When others would give life, and bring a tomb.   There lives more life in one of your fair eyes,   Than both your poets can in praise devise.
Who is it that says most, which can say more, Than this rich praise: that you alone are you, In whose confine immured is the store, Which should example where your equal grew. Lean penury within that pen doth dwell, That to his subject lends not some small glory, But he that writes of you, if he can tell, That you are you, so dignifies his story. Let him but copy what in you is writ, Not making worse what nature made so clear, And such a counterpart shall fame his wit, Making his style admired every where.   You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,   Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.
My tongue-tied muse in manners holds her still, While comments of your praise richly compiled, Reserve their character with golden quill, And precious phrase by all the Muses filed. I think good thoughts, whilst other write good words, And like unlettered clerk still cry Amen, To every hymn that able spirit affords, In polished form of well refined pen. Hearing you praised, I say ’tis so, ’tis true, And to the most of praise add something more, But that is in my thought, whose love to you (Though words come hindmost) holds his rank before,   Then others, for the breath of words respect,   Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.
Was it the proud full sail of his great verse, Bound for the prize of (all too precious) you, That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse, Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew? Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write, Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead? No, neither he, nor his compeers by night Giving him aid, my verse astonished. He nor that affable familiar ghost Which nightly gulls him with intelligence, As victors of my silence cannot boast, I was not sick of any fear from thence.   But when your countenance filled up his line,   Then lacked I matter, that enfeebled mine.
Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing, And like enough thou know’st thy estimate, The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing: My bonds in thee are all determinate. For how do I hold thee but by thy granting, And for that riches where is my deserving? The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting, And so my patent back again is swerving. Thyself thou gav’st, thy own worth then not knowing, Or me to whom thou gav’st it, else mistaking, So thy great gift upon misprision growing, Comes home again, on better judgement making.   Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter,   In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.
When thou shalt be disposed to set me light, And place my merit in the eye of scorn, Upon thy side, against my self I’ll fight, And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn: With mine own weakness being best acquainted, Upon thy part I can set down a story Of faults concealed, wherein I am attainted: That thou in losing me, shalt win much glory: And I by this will be a gainer too, For bending all my loving thoughts on thee, The injuries that to my self I do, Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.   Such is my love, to thee I so belong,   That for thy right, my self will bear all wrong.
Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault, And I will comment upon that offence, Speak of my lameness, and I straight will halt: Against thy reasons making no defence. Thou canst not (love) disgrace me half so ill, To set a form upon desired change, As I’ll my self disgrace, knowing thy will, I will acquaintance strangle and look strange: Be absent from thy walks and in my tongue, Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell, Lest I, too much profane, should do it wrong, And haply of our old acquaintance tell.   For thee, against my self I’ll vow debate,   For I must ne’er love him whom thou dost hate.
Then hate me when thou wilt, if ever, now, Now while the world is bent my deeds to cross, join with the spite of fortune, make me bow, And do not drop in for an after-loss: Ah do not, when my heart hath ’scaped this sorrow, Come in the rearward of a conquered woe, Give not a windy night a rainy morrow, To linger out a purposed overthrow. If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last, When other petty griefs have done their spite, But in the onset come, so shall I taste At first the very worst of fortune’s might.   And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,   Compared with loss of thee, will not seem so.
Some glory in their birth, some in their skill, Some in their wealth, some in their body’s force, Some in their garments though new-fangled ill: Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse. And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure, Wherein it finds a joy above the rest, But these particulars are not my measure, All these I better in one general best. Thy love is better than high birth to me, Richer than wealth, prouder than garments’ costs, Of more delight than hawks and horses be: And having thee, of all men’s pride I boast.   Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take,   All this away, and me most wretched make.
But do thy worst to steal thyself away, For term of life thou art assured mine, And life no longer than thy love will stay, For it depends upon that love of thine. Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs, When in the least of them my life hath end, I see, a better state to me belongs Than that, which on thy humour doth depend. Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind, Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie, O what a happy title do I find, Happy to have thy love, happy to die!   But what’s so blessed-fair that fears no blot?   Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.
So shall I live, supposing thou art true, Like a deceived husband, so love’s face, May still seem love to me, though altered new: Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place. For there can live no hatred in thine eye, Therefore in that I cannot know thy change, In many’s looks, the false heart’s history Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange. But heaven in thy creation did decree, That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell, Whate’er thy thoughts, or thy heart’s workings be, Thy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell.   How like Eve’s apple doth thy beauty grow,   If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show.
They that have power to hurt, and will do none, That do not do the thing, they most do show, Who moving others, are themselves as stone, Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow: They rightly do inherit heaven’s graces, And husband nature’s riches from expense, They are the lords and owners of their faces, Others, but stewards of their excellence: The summer’s flower is to the summer sweet, Though to it self, it only live and die, But if that flower with base infection meet, The basest weed outbraves his dignity:   For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds,   Lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds.
How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame, Which like a canker in the fragrant rose, Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name! O in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose! That tongue that tells the story of thy days, (Making lascivious comments on thy sport) Cannot dispraise, but in a kind of praise, Naming thy name, blesses an ill report. O what a mansion have those vices got, Which for their habitation chose out thee, Where beauty’s veil doth cover every blot, And all things turns to fair, that eyes can see!   Take heed (dear heart) of this large privilege,   The hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edge.
Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness, Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport, Both grace and faults are loved of more and less: Thou mak’st faults graces, that to thee resort: As on the finger of a throned queen, The basest jewel will be well esteemed: So are those errors that in thee are seen, To truths translated, and for true things deemed. How many lambs might the stern wolf betray, If like a lamb he could his looks translate! How many gazers mightst thou lead away, If thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!   But do not so, I love thee in such sort,   As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.
How like a winter hath my absence been From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year! What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen! What old December’s bareness everywhere! And yet this time removed was summer’s time, The teeming autumn big with rich increase, Bearing the wanton burden of the prime, Like widowed wombs after their lords’ decease: Yet this abundant issue seemed to me But hope of orphans, and unfathered fruit, For summer and his pleasures wait on thee, And thou away, the very birds are mute.   Or if they sing, ’tis with so dull a cheer,   That leaves look pale, dreading the winter’s near.
From you have I been absent in the spring, When proud-pied April (dressed in all his trim) Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing: That heavy Saturn laughed and leaped with him. Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell Of different flowers in odour and in hue, Could make me any summer’s story tell: Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew: Nor did I wonder at the lily’s white, Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose, They were but sweet, but figures of delight: Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.   Yet seemed it winter still, and you away,   As with your shadow I with these did play.
The forward violet thus did I chide, Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells, If not from my love’s breath? The purple pride Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells, In my love’s veins thou hast too grossly dyed. The lily I condemned for thy hand, And buds of marjoram had stol’n thy hair, The roses fearfully on thorns did stand, One blushing shame, another white despair: A third nor red, nor white, had stol’n of both, And to his robbery had annexed thy breath, But for his theft in pride of all his growth A vengeful canker eat him up to death.   More flowers I noted, yet I none could see,   But sweet, or colour it had stol’n from thee.
Where art thou Muse that thou forget’st so long, To speak of that which gives thee all thy might? Spend’st thou thy fury on some worthless song, Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light? Return forgetful Muse, and straight redeem, In gentle numbers time so idly spent, Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem, And gives thy pen both skill and argument. Rise resty Muse, my love’s sweet face survey, If time have any wrinkle graven there, If any, be a satire to decay, And make time’s spoils despised everywhere.   Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life,   So thou prevent’st his scythe, and crooked knife.
O truant Muse what shall be thy amends, For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed? Both truth and beauty on my love depends: So dost thou too, and therein dignified: Make answer Muse, wilt thou not haply say, ’Truth needs no colour with his colour fixed, Beauty no pencil, beauty’s truth to lay: But best is best, if never intermixed’? Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb? Excuse not silence so, for’t lies in thee, To make him much outlive a gilded tomb: And to be praised of ages yet to be.   Then do thy office Muse, I teach thee how,   To make him seem long hence, as he shows now.
My love is strengthened though more weak in seeming, I love not less, though less the show appear, That love is merchandized, whose rich esteeming, The owner’s tongue doth publish every where. Our love was new, and then but in the spring, When I was wont to greet it with my lays, As Philomel in summer’s front doth sing, And stops her pipe in growth of riper days: Not that the summer is less pleasant now Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night, But that wild music burthens every bough, And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.   Therefore like her, I sometime hold my tongue:   Because I would not dull you with my song.
Alack what poverty my muse brings forth, That having such a scope to show her pride, The argument all bare is of more worth Than when it hath my added praise beside. O blame me not if I no more can write! Look in your glass and there appears a face, That over-goes my blunt invention quite, Dulling my lines, and doing me disgrace. Were it not sinful then striving to mend, To mar the subject that before was well? For to no other pass my verses tend, Than of your graces and your gifts to tell.   And more, much more than in my verse can sit,   Your own glass shows you, when you look in it.
To me fair friend you never can be old, For as you were when first your eye I eyed, Such seems your beauty still: three winters cold, Have from the forests shook three summers’ pride, Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned, In process of the seasons have I seen, Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned, Since first I saw you fresh which yet are green. Ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand, Steal from his figure, and no pace perceived, So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceived.   For fear of which, hear this thou age unbred,   Ere you were born was beauty’s summer dead.
Let not my love be called idolatry, Nor my beloved as an idol show, Since all alike my songs and praises be To one, of one, still such, and ever so. Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind, Still constant in a wondrous excellence, Therefore my verse to constancy confined, One thing expressing, leaves out difference. Fair, kind, and true, is all my argument, Fair, kind, and true, varying to other words, And in this change is my invention spent, Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.   Fair, kind, and true, have often lived alone.   Which three till now, never kept seat in one.
When in the chronicle of wasted time, I see descriptions of the fairest wights, And beauty making beautiful old rhyme, In praise of ladies dead, and lovely knights, Then in the blazon of sweet beauty’s best, Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow, I see their antique pen would have expressed, Even such a beauty as you master now. So all their praises are but prophecies Of this our time, all you prefiguring, And for they looked but with divining eyes, They had not skill enough your worth to sing:   For we which now behold these present days,   Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.
Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul, Of the wide world, dreaming on things to come, Can yet the lease of my true love control, Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom. The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured, And the sad augurs mock their own presage, Incertainties now crown themselves assured, And peace proclaims olives of endless age. Now with the drops of this most balmy time, My love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes, Since spite of him I’ll live in this poor rhyme, While he insults o’er dull and speechless tribes.   And thou in this shalt find thy monument,   When tyrants’ crests and tombs of brass are spent.
What’s in the brain that ink may character, Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit, What’s new to speak, what now to register, That may express my love, or thy dear merit? Nothing sweet boy, but yet like prayers divine, I must each day say o’er the very same, Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine, Even as when first I hallowed thy fair name. So that eternal love in love’s fresh case, Weighs not the dust and injury of age, Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place, But makes antiquity for aye his page,   Finding the first conceit of love there bred,   Where time and outward form would show it dead.
O for my sake do you with Fortune chide, The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds, That did not better for my life provide, Than public means which public manners breeds. Thence comes it that my name receives a brand, And almost thence my nature is subdued To what it works in, like the dyer’s hand: Pity me then, and wish I were renewed, Whilst like a willing patient I will drink, Potions of eisel ’gainst my strong infection, No bitterness that I will bitter think, Nor double penance to correct correction.   Pity me then dear friend, and I assure ye,   Even that your pity is enough to cure me.
Your love and pity doth th’ impression fill, Which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow, For what care I who calls me well or ill, So you o’er-green my bad, my good allow? You are my all the world, and I must strive, To know my shames and praises from your tongue, None else to me, nor I to none alive, That my steeled sense or changes right or wrong. In so profound abysm I throw all care Of others’ voices, that my adder’s sense, To critic and to flatterer stopped are: Mark how with my neglect I do dispense.   You are so strongly in my purpose bred,   That all the world besides methinks are dead.
Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind, And that which governs me to go about, Doth part his function, and is partly blind, Seems seeing, but effectually is out: For it no form delivers to the heart Of bird, of flower, or shape which it doth latch, Of his quick objects hath the mind no part, Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch: For if it see the rud’st or gentlest sight, The most sweet favour or deformed’st creature, The mountain, or the sea, the day, or night: The crow, or dove, it shapes them to your feature.   Incapable of more, replete with you,   My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue.
Or whether doth my mind being crowned with you Drink up the monarch’s plague this flattery? Or whether shall I say mine eye saith true, And that your love taught it this alchemy? To make of monsters, and things indigest, Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble, Creating every bad a perfect best As fast as objects to his beams assemble: O ’tis the first, ’tis flattery in my seeing, And my great mind most kingly drinks it up, Mine eye well knows what with his gust is ’greeing, And to his palate doth prepare the cup.   If it be poisoned, ’tis the lesser sin,   That mine eye loves it and doth first begin.
Those lines that I before have writ do lie, Even those that said I could not love you dearer, Yet then my judgement knew no reason why, My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer, But reckoning time, whose millioned accidents Creep in ’twixt vows, and change decrees of kings, Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp’st intents, Divert strong minds to the course of alt’ring things: Alas why fearing of time’s tyranny, Might I not then say ‘Now I love you best,’ When I was certain o’er incertainty, Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?   Love is a babe, then might I not say so   To give full growth to that which still doth grow.
Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments, love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds, Or bends with the remover to remove. O no, it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wand’ring bark, Whose worth’s unknown, although his height be taken. Love’s not Time’s fool, though rosy lips and cheeks Within his bending sickle’s compass come, Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, But bears it out even to the edge of doom:   If this be error and upon me proved,   I never writ, nor no man ever loved.
Accuse me thus, that I have scanted all, Wherein I should your great deserts repay, Forgot upon your dearest love to call, Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day, That I have frequent been with unknown minds, And given to time your own dear-purchased right, That I have hoisted sail to all the winds Which should transport me farthest from your sight. Book both my wilfulness and errors down, And on just proof surmise, accumulate, Bring me within the level of your frown, But shoot not at me in your wakened hate:   Since my appeal says I did strive to prove   The constancy and virtue of your love.
Like as to make our appetite more keen With eager compounds we our palate urge, As to prevent our maladies unseen, We sicken to shun sickness when we purge. Even so being full of your ne’er-cloying sweetness, To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding; And sick of welfare found a kind of meetness, To be diseased ere that there was true needing. Thus policy in love t’ anticipate The ills that were not, grew to faults assured, And brought to medicine a healthful state Which rank of goodness would by ill be cured.   But thence I learn and find the lesson true,   Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you.
What potions have I drunk of Siren tears Distilled from limbecks foul as hell within, Applying fears to hopes, and hopes to fears, Still losing when I saw my self to win! What wretched errors hath my heart committed, Whilst it hath thought it self so blessed never! How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted In the distraction of this madding fever! O benefit of ill, now I find true That better is, by evil still made better. And ruined love when it is built anew Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.   So I return rebuked to my content,   And gain by ills thrice more than I have spent.
That you were once unkind befriends me now, And for that sorrow, which I then did feel, Needs must I under my transgression bow, Unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel. For if you were by my unkindness shaken As I by yours, y’have passed a hell of time, And I a tyrant have no leisure taken To weigh how once I suffered in your crime. O that our night of woe might have remembered My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits, And soon to you, as you to me then tendered The humble salve, which wounded bosoms fits!   But that your trespass now becomes a fee,   Mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.
’Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed, When not to be, receives reproach of being, And the just pleasure lost, which is so deemed, Not by our feeling, but by others’ seeing. For why should others’ false adulterate eyes Give salutation to my sportive blood? Or on my frailties why are frailer spies, Which in their wills count bad what I think good? No, I am that I am, and they that level At my abuses, reckon up their own, I may be straight though they themselves be bevel; By their rank thoughts, my deeds must not be shown   Unless this general evil they maintain,   All men are bad and in their badness reign.
Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain Full charactered with lasting memory, Which shall above that idle rank remain Beyond all date even to eternity. Or at the least, so long as brain and heart Have faculty by nature to subsist, Till each to razed oblivion yield his part Of thee, thy record never can be missed: That poor retention could not so much hold, Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score, Therefore to give them from me was I bold, To trust those tables that receive thee more:   To keep an adjunct to remember thee   Were to import forgetfulness in me.
No! Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change, Thy pyramids built up with newer might To me are nothing novel, nothing strange, They are but dressings of a former sight: Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire, What thou dost foist upon us that is old, And rather make them born to our desire, Than think that we before have heard them told: Thy registers and thee I both defy, Not wond’ring at the present, nor the past, For thy records, and what we see doth lie, Made more or less by thy continual haste:   This I do vow and this shall ever be,   I will be true despite thy scythe and thee.
If my dear love were but the child of state, It might for Fortune’s bastard be unfathered, As subject to time’s love or to time’s hate, Weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gathered. No it was builded far from accident, It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls Under the blow of thralled discontent, Whereto th’ inviting time our fashion calls: It fears not policy that heretic, Which works on leases of short-numbered hours, But all alone stands hugely politic, That it nor grows with heat, nor drowns with showers.   To this I witness call the fools of time,   Which die for goodness, who have lived for crime.
Were’t aught to me I bore the canopy, With my extern the outward honouring, Or laid great bases for eternity, Which proves more short than waste or ruining? Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour Lose all, and more by paying too much rent For compound sweet; forgoing simple savour, Pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent? No, let me be obsequious in thy heart, And take thou my oblation, poor but free, Which is not mixed with seconds, knows no art, But mutual render, only me for thee.   Hence, thou suborned informer, a true soul   When most impeached, stands least in thy control.
O thou my lovely boy who in thy power, Dost hold Time’s fickle glass his fickle hour: Who hast by waning grown, and therein show’st, Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self grow’st. If Nature (sovereign mistress over wrack) As thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back, She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill May time disgrace, and wretched minutes kill. Yet fear her O thou minion of her pleasure, She may detain, but not still keep her treasure!   Her audit (though delayed) answered must be,   And her quietus is to render thee.
In the old age black was not counted fair, Or if it were it bore not beauty’s name: But now is black beauty’s successive heir, And beauty slandered with a bastard shame, For since each hand hath put on nature’s power, Fairing the foul with art’s false borrowed face, Sweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower, But is profaned, if not lives in disgrace. Therefore my mistress’ eyes are raven black, Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem At such who not born fair no beauty lack, Slandering creation with a false esteem,   Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe,   That every tongue says beauty should look so.
How oft when thou, my music, music play’st, Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds With thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway’st The wiry concord that mine ear confounds, Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap, To kiss the tender inward of thy hand, Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap, At the wood’s boldness by thee blushing stand. To be so tickled they would change their state And situation with those dancing chips, O’er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait, Making dead wood more blest than living lips,   Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,   Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.
Th’ expense of spirit in a waste of shame Is lust in action, and till action, lust Is perjured, murd’rous, bloody full of blame, Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust, Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight, Past reason hunted, and no sooner had Past reason hated as a swallowed bait, On purpose laid to make the taker mad. Mad in pursuit and in possession so, Had, having, and in quest, to have extreme, A bliss in proof, and proved, a very woe; Before a joy proposed behind a dream.   All this the world well knows yet none knows well,   To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.
Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art, As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel; For well thou know’st to my dear doting heart Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel. Yet in good faith some say that thee behold, Thy face hath not the power to make love groan; To say they err, I dare not be so bold, Although I swear it to my self alone. And to be sure that is not false I swear, A thousand groans but thinking on thy face, One on another’s neck do witness bear Thy black is fairest in my judgement’s place.   In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,   And thence this slander as I think proceeds.
Thine eyes I love, and they as pitying me, Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain, Have put on black, and loving mourners be, Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain. And truly not the morning sun of heaven Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east, Nor that full star that ushers in the even Doth half that glory to the sober west As those two mourning eyes become thy face: O let it then as well beseem thy heart To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace, And suit thy pity like in every part.   Then will I swear beauty herself is black,   And all they foul that thy complexion lack.
Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan For that deep wound it gives my friend and me; Is’t not enough to torture me alone, But slave to slavery my sweet’st friend must be? Me from my self thy cruel eye hath taken, And my next self thou harder hast engrossed, Of him, my self, and thee I am forsaken, A torment thrice three-fold thus to be crossed: Prison my heart in thy steel bosom’s ward, But then my friend’s heart let my poor heart bail, Whoe’er keeps me, let my heart be his guard, Thou canst not then use rigour in my gaol.   And yet thou wilt, for I being pent in thee,   Perforce am thine and all that is in me.
So now I have confessed that he is thine, And I my self am mortgaged to thy will, My self I’ll forfeit, so that other mine, Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still: But thou wilt not, nor he will not be free, For thou art covetous, and he is kind, He learned but surety-like to write for me, Under that bond that him as fist doth bind. The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take, Thou usurer that put’st forth all to use, And sue a friend, came debtor for my sake, So him I lose through my unkind abuse.   Him have I lost, thou hast both him and me,   He pays the whole, and yet am I not free.
Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy will, And Will to boot, and Will in overplus, More than enough am I that vex thee still, To thy sweet will making addition thus. Wilt thou whose will is large and spacious, Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine? Shall will in others seem right gracious, And in my will no fair acceptance shine? The sea all water, yet receives rain still, And in abundance addeth to his store, So thou being rich in will add to thy will One will of mine to make thy large will more.   Let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill,   Think all but one, and me in that one Will.
If thy soul check thee that I come so near, Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy Will, And will thy soul knows is admitted there, Thus far for love, my love-suit sweet fulfil. Will will fulfil the treasure of thy love, Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one, In things of great receipt with case we prove, Among a number one is reckoned none. Then in the number let me pass untold, Though in thy store’s account I one must be, For nothing hold me, so it please thee hold, That nothing me, a something sweet to thee.   Make but my name thy love, and love that still,   And then thou lov’st me for my name is Will.
Thou blind fool Love, what dost thou to mine eyes, That they behold and see not what they see? They know what beauty is, see where it lies, Yet what the best is, take the worst to be. If eyes corrupt by over-partial looks, Be anchored in the bay where all men ride, Why of eyes’ falsehood hast thou forged hooks, Whereto the judgement of my heart is tied? Why should my heart think that a several plot, Which my heart knows the wide world’s common place? Or mine eyes seeing this, say this is not To put fair truth upon so foul a face?   In things right true my heart and eyes have erred,   And to this false plague are they now transferred.
When my love swears that she is made of truth, I do believe, her though I know she lies, That she might think me some untutored youth, Unlearned in the world’s false subtleties. Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young, Although she knows my days are past the best, Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue; On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed. But wherefore says she not she is unjust? And wherefore say not I that I am old? O love’s best habit is in seeming trust, And age in love loves not to have years told.   Therefore I lie with her, and she with me,   And in our faults by lies we flattered be.
O call not me to justify the wrong, That thy unkindness lays upon my heart, Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue, Use power with power, and slay me not by art, Tell me thou lov’st elsewhere; but in my sight, Dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside, What need’st thou wound with cunning when thy might Is more than my o’erpressed defence can bide? Let me excuse thee, ah my love well knows, Her pretty looks have been mine enemies, And therefore from my face she turns my foes, That they elsewhere might dart their injuries:   Yet do not so, but since I am near slain,   Kill me outright with looks, and rid my pain.
Be wise as thou art cruel, do not press My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain: Lest sorrow lend me words and words express, The manner of my pity-wanting pain. If I might teach thee wit better it were, Though not to love, yet love to tell me so, As testy sick men when their deaths be near, No news but health from their physicians know. For if I should despair I should grow mad, And in my madness might speak ill of thee, Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad, Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be.   That I may not be so, nor thou belied,   Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.
In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes, For they in thee a thousand errors note, But ’tis my heart that loves what they despise, Who in despite of view is pleased to dote. Nor are mine ears with thy tongue’s tune delighted, Nor tender feeling to base touches prone, Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited To any sensual feast with thee alone: But my five wits, nor my five senses can Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee, Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man, Thy proud heart’s slave and vassal wretch to be:   Only my plague thus far I count my gain,   That she that makes me sin, awards me pain.
Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate, Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving, O but with mine, compare thou thine own state, And thou shalt find it merits not reproving, Or if it do, not from those lips of thine, That have profaned their scarlet ornaments, And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine, Robbed others’ beds’ revenues of their rents. Be it lawful I love thee as thou lov’st those, Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee, Root pity in thy heart that when it grows, Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.   If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,   By self-example mayst thou be denied.
Lo as a careful huswife runs to catch, One of her feathered creatures broke away, Sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch In pursuit of the thing she would have stay: Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase, Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent, To follow that which flies before her face: Not prizing her poor infant’s discontent; So run’st thou after that which flies from thee, Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind, But if thou catch thy hope turn back to me: And play the mother’s part, kiss me, be kind.   So will I pray that thou mayst have thy Will,   If thou turn back and my loud crying still.
Two loves I have, of comfort and despair, Which, like two spirits, do suggest me still: The better angel is a man right fair, The worser spirit a woman coloured ill. To win me soon to hell my female evil Tempteth my better angel from my side, And would corrupt my saint to be a devil, Wooing his purity with her foul pride. And whether that my angel be turned fiend Suspect I may, yet not directly tell; But being both from me both to each friend, I guess one angel in another’s hell.   Yet this shall I ne’er know, but live in doubt,   Till my bad angel fire my good one out.
Those lips that Love’s own hand did make, Breathed forth the sound that said ‘I hate’, To me that languished for her sake: But when she saw my woeful state, Straight in her heart did mercy come, Chiding that tongue that ever sweet, Was used in giving gentle doom: And taught it thus anew to greet: ‘I hate’ she altered with an end, That followed it as gentle day, Doth follow night who like a fiend From heaven to hell is flown away.   ‘I hate’, from hate away she threw,   And saved my life saying ‘not you’.
Poor soul the centre of my sinful earth, My sinful earth these rebel powers array, Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth Painting thy outward walls so costly gay? Why so large cost having so short a lease, Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend? Shall worms inheritors of this excess Eat up thy charge? is this thy body’s end? Then soul live thou upon thy servant’s loss, And let that pine to aggravate thy store; Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross; Within be fed, without be rich no more,   So shall thou feed on death, that feeds on men,   And death once dead, there’s no more dying then.
My love is as a fever longing still, For that which longer nurseth the disease, Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill, Th’ uncertain sickly appetite to please: My reason the physician to my love, Angry that his prescriptions are not kept Hath left me, and I desperate now approve, Desire is death, which physic did except. Past cure I am, now reason is past care, And frantic-mad with evermore unrest, My thoughts and my discourse as mad men’s are, At random from the truth vainly expressed.   For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,   Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.
O me! what eyes hath love put in my head, Which have no correspondence with true sight, Or if they have, where is my judgement fled, That censures falsely what they see aright? If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote, What means the world to say it is not so? If it be not, then love doth well denote, Love’s eye is not so true as all men’s: no, How can it? O how can love’s eye be true, That is so vexed with watching and with tears? No marvel then though I mistake my view, The sun it self sees not, till heaven clears.   O cunning love, with tears thou keep’st me blind,   Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.
Canst thou O cruel, say I love thee not, When I against my self with thee partake? Do I not think on thee when I forgot Am of my self, all-tyrant, for thy sake? Who hateth thee that I do call my friend, On whom frown’st thou that I do fawn upon, Nay if thou lour’st on me do I not spend Revenge upon my self with present moan? What merit do I in my self respect, That is so proud thy service to despise, When all my best doth worship thy defect, Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?   But love hate on for now I know thy mind,   Those that can see thou lov’st, and I am blind.
O from what power hast thou this powerful might, With insufficiency my heart to sway, To make me give the lie to my true sight, And swear that brightness doth not grace the day? Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill, That in the very refuse of thy deeds, There is such strength and warrantise of skill, That in my mind thy worst all best exceeds? Who taught thee how to make me love thee more, The more I hear and see just cause of hate? O though I love what others do abhor, With others thou shouldst not abhor my state.   If thy unworthiness raised love in me,   More worthy I to be beloved of thee.
Love is too young to know what conscience is, Yet who knows not conscience is born of love? Then gentle cheater urge not my amiss, Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove. For thou betraying me, I do betray My nobler part to my gross body’s treason, My soul doth tell my body that he may, Triumph in love, flesh stays no farther reason, But rising at thy name doth point out thee, As his triumphant prize, proud of this pride, He is contented thy poor drudge to be, To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.   No want of conscience hold it that I call,   Her love, for whose dear love I rise and fall.
In loving thee thou know’st I am forsworn, But thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing, In act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn, In vowing new hate after new love bearing: But why of two oaths’ breach do I accuse thee, When I break twenty? I am perjured most, For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee: And all my honest faith in thee is lost. For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness: Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy, And to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness, Or made them swear against the thing they see.   For I have sworn thee fair: more perjured I,   To swear against the truth so foul a lie.
The little Love-god lying once asleep, Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand, Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep, Came tripping by, but in her maiden hand, The fairest votary took up that fire, Which many legions of true hearts had warmed, And so the general of hot desire, Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed. This brand she quenched in a cool well by, Which from Love’s fire took heat perpetual, Growing a bath and healthful remedy, For men diseased; but I, my mistress’ thrall,   Came there for cure and this by that I prove,   Love’s fire heats water, water cools not love.

ACT I  SCENE I. Rossillon. A room in the Countess’s palace.   Enter Bertram, the Countess of Rossillon, Helena, and Lafew, all in  black.  COUNTESS. In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.  BERTRAM. And I in going, madam, weep o’er my father’s death anew; but I must attend his majesty’s command, to whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.  LAFEW. You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you, sir, a father. He that so generally is at all times good, must of necessity hold his virtue to you, whose worthiness would stir it up where it wanted, rather than lack it where there is such abundance.  COUNTESS. What hope is there of his majesty’s amendment?  LAFEW. He hath abandon’d his physicians, madam; under whose practices he hath persecuted time with hope, and finds no other advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time.  COUNTESS. This young gentlewoman had a father—O that “had!”, how sad a passage ’tis!—whose skill was almost as great as his honesty; had it stretch’d so far, would have made nature immortal, and death should have play for lack of work. Would for the king’s sake he were living! I think it would be the death of the king’s disease.  LAFEW. How called you the man you speak of, madam?  COUNTESS. He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.  LAFEW. He was excellent indeed, madam; the king very lately spoke of him admiringly, and mourningly; he was skilful enough to have liv’d still, if knowledge could be set up against mortality.  BERTRAM. What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?  LAFEW. A fistula, my lord.  BERTRAM. I heard not of it before.  LAFEW. I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?  COUNTESS. His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that her education promises her dispositions she inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there commendations go with pity, they are virtues and traitors too. In her they are the better for their simpleness; she derives her honesty, and achieves her goodness.  LAFEW. Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.  COUNTESS. ’Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in. The remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena; go to, no more, lest it be rather thought you affect a sorrow than to have.  HELENA. I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.  LAFEW. Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead; excessive grief the enemy to the living.  COUNTESS. If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess makes it soon mortal.  BERTRAM. Madam, I desire your holy wishes.  LAFEW. How understand we that?  COUNTESS. Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father In manners, as in shape! Thy blood and virtue Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few, Do wrong to none. Be able for thine enemy Rather in power than use; and keep thy friend Under thy own life’s key. Be check’d for silence, But never tax’d for speech. What heaven more will, That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down, Fall on thy head! Farewell. My lord, ’Tis an unseason’d courtier; good my lord, Advise him.  LAFEW. He cannot want the best That shall attend his love.  COUNTESS. Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.   [_Exit Countess._]  BERTRAM. The best wishes that can be forg’d in your thoughts be servants to you! [_To Helena._] Be comfortable to my mother, your mistress, and make much of her.  LAFEW. Farewell, pretty lady, you must hold the credit of your father.   [_Exeunt Bertram and Lafew._]  HELENA. O, were that all! I think not on my father, And these great tears grace his remembrance more Than those I shed for him. What was he like? I have forgot him; my imagination Carries no favour in’t but Bertram’s. I am undone: there is no living, none, If Bertram be away. ’Twere all one That I should love a bright particular star, And think to wed it, he is so above me. In his bright radiance and collateral light Must I be comforted, not in his sphere. Th’ambition in my love thus plagues itself: The hind that would be mated by the lion Must die for love. ’Twas pretty, though a plague, To see him every hour; to sit and draw His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls, In our heart’s table,—heart too capable Of every line and trick of his sweet favour. But now he’s gone, and my idolatrous fancy Must sanctify his relics. Who comes here?   Enter Parolles.  One that goes with him: I love him for his sake, And yet I know him a notorious liar, Think him a great way fool, solely a coward; Yet these fix’d evils sit so fit in him That they take place when virtue’s steely bones Looks bleak i’ th’ cold wind: withal, full oft we see Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.  PAROLLES. Save you, fair queen!  HELENA. And you, monarch!  PAROLLES. No.  HELENA. And no.  PAROLLES. Are you meditating on virginity?  HELENA. Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you; let me ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how may we barricado it against him?  PAROLLES. Keep him out.  HELENA. But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant, in the defence, yet is weak. Unfold to us some warlike resistance.  PAROLLES. There is none. Man setting down before you will undermine you and blow you up.  HELENA. Bless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers-up! Is there no military policy how virgins might blow up men?  PAROLLES. Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be blown up; marry, in blowing him down again, with the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational increase, and there was never virgin got till virginity was first lost. That you were made of is metal to make virgins. Virginity, by being once lost, may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is ever lost. ’Tis too cold a companion. Away with it!  HELENA. I will stand for’t a little, though therefore I die a virgin.  PAROLLES. There’s little can be said in’t; ’tis against the rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin: virginity murders itself, and should be buried in highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites, much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach. Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but lose by’t. Out with’t! Within the year it will make itself two, which is a goodly increase, and the principal itself not much the worse. Away with it!  HELENA. How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?  PAROLLES. Let me see. Marry, ill, to like him that ne’er it likes. ’Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying; the longer kept, the less worth. Off with’t while ’tis vendible; answer the time of request. Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out of fashion, richly suited, but unsuitable, just like the brooch and the toothpick, which wear not now. Your date is better in your pie and your porridge than in your cheek. And your virginity, your old virginity, is like one of our French wither’d pears; it looks ill, it eats drily; marry, ’tis a wither’d pear; it was formerly better; marry, yet ’tis a wither’d pear. Will you anything with it?  HELENA. Not my virginity yet. There shall your master have a thousand loves, A mother, and a mistress, and a friend, A phoenix, captain, and an enemy, A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign, A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear: His humble ambition, proud humility, His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet, His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he— I know not what he shall. God send him well! The court’s a learning-place; and he is one.  PAROLLES. What one, i’ faith?  HELENA. That I wish well. ’Tis pity—  PAROLLES. What’s pity?  HELENA. That wishing well had not a body in’t Which might be felt, that we, the poorer born, Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes, Might with effects of them follow our friends, And show what we alone must think, which never Returns us thanks.   Enter a Page.  PAGE. Monsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.   [_Exit Page._]  PAROLLES. Little Helen, farewell. If I can remember thee, I will think of thee at court.  HELENA. Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.  PAROLLES. Under Mars, I.  HELENA. I especially think, under Mars.  PAROLLES. Why under Mars?  HELENA. The wars hath so kept you under, that you must needs be born under Mars.  PAROLLES. When he was predominant.  HELENA. When he was retrograde, I think rather.  PAROLLES. Why think you so?  HELENA. You go so much backward when you fight.  PAROLLES. That’s for advantage.  HELENA. So is running away, when fear proposes the safety: but the composition that your valour and fear makes in you is a virtue of a good wing, and I like the wear well.  PAROLLES. I am so full of business I cannot answer thee acutely. I will return perfect courtier; in the which my instruction shall serve to naturalize thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier’s counsel, and understand what advice shall thrust upon thee; else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and thine ignorance makes thee away. Farewell. When thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast none, remember thy friends. Get thee a good husband, and use him as he uses thee. So, farewell.   [_Exit._]  HELENA. Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie, Which we ascribe to heaven: the fated sky Gives us free scope; only doth backward pull Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull. What power is it which mounts my love so high, That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye? The mightiest space in fortune nature brings To join like likes, and kiss like native things. Impossible be strange attempts to those That weigh their pains in sense, and do suppose What hath been cannot be. Who ever strove To show her merit that did miss her love? The king’s disease,—my project may deceive me, But my intents are fix’d, and will not leave me.   [_Exit._]  SCENE II. Paris. A room in the King’s palace.   Flourish of cornets. Enter the King of France, with letters; Lords and  others attending.  KING. The Florentines and Senoys are by th’ ears; Have fought with equal fortune, and continue A braving war.  FIRST LORD. So ’tis reported, sir.  KING. Nay, ’tis most credible, we here receive it, A certainty, vouch’d from our cousin Austria, With caution, that the Florentine will move us For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend Prejudicates the business, and would seem To have us make denial.  FIRST LORD. His love and wisdom, Approv’d so to your majesty, may plead For amplest credence.  KING. He hath arm’d our answer, And Florence is denied before he comes: Yet, for our gentlemen that mean to see The Tuscan service, freely have they leave To stand on either part.  SECOND LORD. It well may serve A nursery to our gentry, who are sick For breathing and exploit.  KING. What’s he comes here?   Enter Bertram, Lafew and Parolles.  FIRST LORD. It is the Count Rossillon, my good lord, Young Bertram.  KING. Youth, thou bear’st thy father’s face; Frank nature, rather curious than in haste, Hath well compos’d thee. Thy father’s moral parts Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.  BERTRAM. My thanks and duty are your majesty’s.  KING. I would I had that corporal soundness now, As when thy father and myself in friendship First tried our soldiership. He did look far Into the service of the time, and was Discipled of the bravest. He lasted long, But on us both did haggish age steal on, And wore us out of act. It much repairs me To talk of your good father; in his youth He had the wit which I can well observe Today in our young lords; but they may jest Till their own scorn return to them unnoted Ere they can hide their levity in honour So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were, His equal had awak’d them, and his honour, Clock to itself, knew the true minute when Exception bid him speak, and at this time His tongue obey’d his hand. Who were below him He us’d as creatures of another place, And bow’d his eminent top to their low ranks, Making them proud of his humility, In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man Might be a copy to these younger times; Which, followed well, would demonstrate them now But goers backward.  BERTRAM. His good remembrance, sir, Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb; So in approof lives not his epitaph As in your royal speech.  KING. Would I were with him! He would always say,— Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words He scatter’d not in ears, but grafted them To grow there and to bear,—“Let me not live,” This his good melancholy oft began On the catastrophe and heel of pastime, When it was out,—“Let me not live” quoth he, “After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses All but new things disdain; whose judgments are Mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies Expire before their fashions.” This he wish’d. I, after him, do after him wish too, Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home, I quickly were dissolved from my hive To give some labourers room.  SECOND LORD. You’re lov’d, sir; They that least lend it you shall lack you first.  KING. I fill a place, I know’t. How long is’t, Count, Since the physician at your father’s died? He was much fam’d.  BERTRAM. Some six months since, my lord.  KING. If he were living, I would try him yet;— Lend me an arm;—the rest have worn me out With several applications; nature and sickness Debate it at their leisure. Welcome, Count; My son’s no dearer.  BERTRAM. Thank your majesty.   [_Exeunt. Flourish._]  SCENE III. Rossillon. A Room in the Palace.   Enter Countess, Steward and Clown.  COUNTESS. I will now hear. What say you of this gentlewoman?  STEWARD. Madam, the care I have had to even your content, I wish might be found in the calendar of my past endeavours; for then we wound our modesty, and make foul the clearness of our deservings, when of ourselves we publish them.  COUNTESS. What does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah. The complaints I have heard of you I do not all believe; ’tis my slowness that I do not; for I know you lack not folly to commit them, and have ability enough to make such knaveries yours.  CLOWN. ’Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow.  COUNTESS. Well, sir.  CLOWN. No, madam, ’tis not so well that I am poor, though many of the rich are damned; but if I may have your ladyship’s good will to go to the world, Isbel the woman and I will do as we may.  COUNTESS. Wilt thou needs be a beggar?  CLOWN. I do beg your good will in this case.  COUNTESS. In what case?  CLOWN. In Isbel’s case and mine own. Service is no heritage, and I think I shall never have the blessing of God till I have issue of my body; for they say barnes are blessings.  COUNTESS. Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.  CLOWN. My poor body, madam, requires it; I am driven on by the flesh, and he must needs go that the devil drives.  COUNTESS. Is this all your worship’s reason?  CLOWN. Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons, such as they are.  COUNTESS. May the world know them?  CLOWN. I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and all flesh and blood are; and indeed I do marry that I may repent.  COUNTESS. Thy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.  CLOWN. I am out of friends, madam, and I hope to have friends for my wife’s sake.  COUNTESS. Such friends are thine enemies, knave.  CLOWN. Y’are shallow, madam, in great friends; for the knaves come to do that for me which I am a-weary of. He that ears my land spares my team, and gives me leave to in the crop: if I be his cuckold, he’s my drudge. He that comforts my wife is the cherisher of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh and blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my flesh and blood is my friend; ergo, he that kisses my wife is my friend. If men could be contented to be what they are, there were no fear in marriage; for young Charbon the puritan and old Poysam the papist, howsome’er their hearts are sever’d in religion, their heads are both one; they may jowl horns together like any deer i’ the herd.  COUNTESS. Wilt thou ever be a foul-mouth’d and calumnious knave?  CLOWN. A prophet I, madam; and I speak the truth the next way:    _For I the ballad will repeat,    Which men full true shall find;    Your marriage comes by destiny,    Your cuckoo sings by kind._  COUNTESS. Get you gone, sir; I’ll talk with you more anon.  STEWARD. May it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come to you; of her I am to speak.  COUNTESS. Sirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her; Helen I mean.  CLOWN. [_Sings._] _   Was this fair face the cause, quoth she,      Why the Grecians sacked Troy?    Fond done, done fond,       Was this King Priam’s joy?    With that she sighed as she stood,    With that she sighed as she stood,       And gave this sentence then:    Among nine bad if one be good,    Among nine bad if one be good,      There’s yet one good in ten._  COUNTESS. What, one good in ten? You corrupt the song, sirrah.  CLOWN. One good woman in ten, madam, which is a purifying o’ the song. Would God would serve the world so all the year! We’d find no fault with the tithe-woman, if I were the parson. One in ten, quoth ’a! And we might have a good woman born but or every blazing star, or at an earthquake, ’twould mend the lottery well; a man may draw his heart out ere he pluck one.  COUNTESS. You’ll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command you!  CLOWN. That man should be at woman’s command, and yet no hurt done! Though honesty be no puritan, yet it will do no hurt; it will wear the surplice of humility over the black gown of a big heart. I am going, forsooth; the business is for Helen to come hither.   [_Exit._]  COUNTESS. Well, now.  STEWARD. I know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely.  COUNTESS. Faith I do. Her father bequeath’d her to me, and she herself, without other advantage, may lawfully make title to as much love as she finds; there is more owing her than is paid, and more shall be paid her than she’ll demand.  STEWARD. Madam, I was very late more near her than I think she wish’d me; alone she was, and did communicate to herself her own words to her own ears; she thought, I dare vow for her, they touch’d not any stranger sense. Her matter was, she loved your son. Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put such difference betwixt their two estates; Love no god, that would not extend his might only where qualities were level; Diana no queen of virgins, that would suffer her poor knight surpris’d, without rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward. This she deliver’d in the most bitter touch of sorrow that e’er I heard virgin exclaim in, which I held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal; sithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns you something to know it.  COUNTESS. You have discharg’d this honestly; keep it to yourself; many likelihoods inform’d me of this before, which hung so tottering in the balance that I could neither believe nor misdoubt. Pray you leave me; stall this in your bosom; and I thank you for your honest care. I will speak with you further anon.   [_Exit Steward._]   Enter Helena.  Even so it was with me when I was young; If ever we are nature’s, these are ours; this thorn Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong; Our blood to us, this to our blood is born; It is the show and seal of nature’s truth, Where love’s strong passion is impress’d in youth. By our remembrances of days foregone, Such were our faults, or then we thought them none. Her eye is sick on’t; I observe her now.  HELENA. What is your pleasure, madam?  COUNTESS. You know, Helen, I am a mother to you.  HELENA. Mine honourable mistress.  COUNTESS. Nay, a mother. Why not a mother? When I said a mother, Methought you saw a serpent. What’s in mother, That you start at it? I say I am your mother, And put you in the catalogue of those That were enwombed mine. ’Tis often seen Adoption strives with nature, and choice breeds A native slip to us from foreign seeds. You ne’er oppress’d me with a mother’s groan, Yet I express to you a mother’s care. God’s mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood To say I am thy mother? What’s the matter, That this distempered messenger of wet, The many-colour’d Iris, rounds thine eye? —Why, that you are my daughter?  HELENA. That I am not.  COUNTESS. I say, I am your mother.  HELENA. Pardon, madam; The Count Rossillon cannot be my brother. I am from humble, he from honoured name; No note upon my parents, his all noble, My master, my dear lord he is; and I His servant live, and will his vassal die. He must not be my brother.  COUNTESS. Nor I your mother?  HELENA. You are my mother, madam; would you were— So that my lord your son were not my brother,— Indeed my mother! or were you both our mothers, I care no more for than I do for heaven, So I were not his sister. Can’t no other, But, I your daughter, he must be my brother?  COUNTESS. Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law. God shield you mean it not! daughter and mother So strive upon your pulse. What! pale again? My fear hath catch’d your fondness; now I see The mystery of your loneliness, and find Your salt tears’ head. Now to all sense ’tis gross You love my son; invention is asham’d, Against the proclamation of thy passion To say thou dost not. Therefore tell me true; But tell me then, ’tis so; for, look, thy cheeks Confess it, t’one to th’other; and thine eyes See it so grossly shown in thy behaviours, That in their kind they speak it; only sin And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue, That truth should be suspected. Speak, is’t so? If it be so, you have wound a goodly clew; If it be not, forswear’t: howe’er, I charge thee, As heaven shall work in me for thine avail, To tell me truly.  HELENA. Good madam, pardon me.  COUNTESS. Do you love my son?  HELENA. Your pardon, noble mistress.  COUNTESS. Love you my son?  HELENA. Do not you love him, madam?  COUNTESS. Go not about; my love hath in’t a bond Whereof the world takes note. Come, come, disclose The state of your affection, for your passions Have to the full appeach’d.  HELENA. Then I confess, Here on my knee, before high heaven and you, That before you, and next unto high heaven, I love your son. My friends were poor, but honest; so’s my love. Be not offended; for it hurts not him That he is lov’d of me; I follow him not By any token of presumptuous suit, Nor would I have him till I do deserve him; Yet never know how that desert should be. I know I love in vain, strive against hope; Yet in this captious and inteemable sieve I still pour in the waters of my love And lack not to lose still. Thus, Indian-like, Religious in mine error, I adore The sun that looks upon his worshipper, But knows of him no more. My dearest madam, Let not your hate encounter with my love, For loving where you do; but if yourself, Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth, Did ever, in so true a flame of liking, Wish chastely, and love dearly, that your Dian Was both herself and love; O then, give pity To her whose state is such that cannot choose But lend and give where she is sure to lose; That seeks not to find that her search implies, But riddle-like, lives sweetly where she dies!  COUNTESS. Had you not lately an intent,—speak truly,— To go to Paris?  HELENA. Madam, I had.  COUNTESS. Wherefore? tell true.  HELENA. I will tell truth; by grace itself I swear. You know my father left me some prescriptions Of rare and prov’d effects, such as his reading And manifest experience had collected For general sovereignty; and that he will’d me In heedfull’st reservation to bestow them, As notes whose faculties inclusive were More than they were in note. Amongst the rest There is a remedy, approv’d, set down, To cure the desperate languishings whereof The king is render’d lost.  COUNTESS. This was your motive For Paris, was it? Speak.  HELENA. My lord your son made me to think of this; Else Paris, and the medicine, and the king, Had from the conversation of my thoughts Haply been absent then.  COUNTESS. But think you, Helen, If you should tender your supposed aid, He would receive it? He and his physicians Are of a mind; he, that they cannot help him; They, that they cannot help. How shall they credit A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools, Embowell’d of their doctrine, have let off The danger to itself?  HELENA. There’s something in’t More than my father’s skill, which was the great’st Of his profession, that his good receipt Shall for my legacy be sanctified By th’ luckiest stars in heaven; and would your honour But give me leave to try success, I’d venture The well-lost life of mine on his grace’s cure. By such a day, an hour.  COUNTESS. Dost thou believe’t?  HELENA. Ay, madam, knowingly.  COUNTESS. Why, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love, Means and attendants, and my loving greetings To those of mine in court. I’ll stay at home, And pray God’s blessing into thy attempt. Be gone tomorrow; and be sure of this, What I can help thee to, thou shalt not miss.   [_Exeunt._]
ACT II.  SCENE I. Paris. A room in the King’s palace.   Flourish. Enter the King with young Lords taking leave for the  Florentine war; Bertram, Parolles and Attendants.  KING. Farewell, young lords; these warlike principles Do not throw from you; and you, my lords, farewell; Share the advice betwixt you; if both gain all, The gift doth stretch itself as ’tis receiv’d, And is enough for both.  FIRST LORD. ’Tis our hope, sir, After well-ent’red soldiers, to return And find your grace in health.  KING. No, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart Will not confess he owes the malady That doth my life besiege. Farewell, young lords. Whether I live or die, be you the sons Of worthy Frenchmen; let higher Italy,— Those bated that inherit but the fall Of the last monarchy—see that you come Not to woo honour, but to wed it, when The bravest questant shrinks: find what you seek, That fame may cry you loud. I say farewell.  SECOND LORD. Health, at your bidding serve your majesty!  KING. Those girls of Italy, take heed of them; They say our French lack language to deny If they demand; beware of being captives Before you serve.  BOTH. Our hearts receive your warnings.  KING. Farewell.—Come hither to me.   [_The King retires to a couch._]  FIRST LORD. O my sweet lord, that you will stay behind us!  PAROLLES. ’Tis not his fault; the spark.  SECOND LORD. O, ’tis brave wars!  PAROLLES. Most admirable! I have seen those wars.  BERTRAM. I am commanded here, and kept a coil with, “Too young”, and “the next year” and “’tis too early”.  PAROLLES. An thy mind stand to’t, boy, steal away bravely.  BERTRAM. I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock, Creaking my shoes on the plain masonry, Till honour be bought up, and no sword worn But one to dance with. By heaven, I’ll steal away.  FIRST LORD. There’s honour in the theft.  PAROLLES. Commit it, count.  SECOND LORD. I am your accessary; and so farewell.  BERTRAM. I grow to you, and our parting is a tortur’d body.  FIRST LORD. Farewell, captain.  SECOND LORD. Sweet Monsieur Parolles!  PAROLLES. Noble heroes, my sword and yours are kin. Good sparks and lustrous, a word, good metals. You shall find in the regiment of the Spinii one Captain Spurio, with his cicatrice, an emblem of war, here on his sinister cheek; it was this very sword entrench’d it. Say to him I live; and observe his reports for me.  FIRST LORD. We shall, noble captain.  PAROLLES. Mars dote on you for his novices!   [_Exeunt Lords._]  What will ye do?  BERTRAM. Stay the king.  PAROLLES. Use a more spacious ceremony to the noble lords; you have restrain’d yourself within the list of too cold an adieu. Be more expressive to them; for they wear themselves in the cap of the time; there do muster true gait; eat, speak, and move, under the influence of the most receiv’d star; and though the devil lead the measure, such are to be followed. After them, and take a more dilated farewell.  BERTRAM. And I will do so.  PAROLLES. Worthy fellows, and like to prove most sinewy sword-men.   [_Exeunt Bertram and Parolles._]   Enter Lafew.  LAFEW. Pardon, my lord [_kneeling_], for me and for my tidings.  KING. I’ll fee thee to stand up.  LAFEW. Then here’s a man stands that has brought his pardon. I would you had kneel’d, my lord, to ask me mercy, And that at my bidding you could so stand up.  KING. I would I had; so I had broke thy pate, And ask’d thee mercy for’t.  LAFEW. Good faith, across; But, my good lord, ’tis thus: will you be cur’d Of your infirmity?  KING. No.  LAFEW. O, will you eat No grapes, my royal fox? Yes, but you will My noble grapes, and if my royal fox Could reach them. I have seen a medicine That’s able to breathe life into a stone, Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary With sprightly fire and motion; whose simple touch Is powerful to araise King Pippen, nay, To give great Charlemain a pen in’s hand And write to her a love-line.  KING. What ‘her’ is this?  LAFEW. Why, doctor ‘she’! My lord, there’s one arriv’d, If you will see her. Now, by my faith and honour, If seriously I may convey my thoughts In this my light deliverance, I have spoke With one that in her sex, her years, profession, Wisdom, and constancy, hath amaz’d me more Than I dare blame my weakness. Will you see her, For that is her demand, and know her business? That done, laugh well at me.  KING. Now, good Lafew, Bring in the admiration; that we with thee May spend our wonder too, or take off thine By wond’ring how thou took’st it.  LAFEW. Nay, I’ll fit you, And not be all day neither.   [_Exit Lafew._]  KING. Thus he his special nothing ever prologues.   Enter Lafew with Helena.  LAFEW. Nay, come your ways.  KING. This haste hath wings indeed.  LAFEW. Nay, come your ways. This is his majesty, say your mind to him. A traitor you do look like, but such traitors His majesty seldom fears; I am Cressid’s uncle, That dare leave two together. Fare you well.   [_Exit._]  KING. Now, fair one, does your business follow us?  HELENA. Ay, my good lord. Gerard de Narbon was my father, In what he did profess, well found.  KING. I knew him.  HELENA. The rather will I spare my praises towards him. Knowing him is enough. On his bed of death Many receipts he gave me; chiefly one, Which, as the dearest issue of his practice, And of his old experience the only darling, He bade me store up as a triple eye, Safer than mine own two; more dear I have so, And hearing your high majesty is touch’d With that malignant cause, wherein the honour Of my dear father’s gift stands chief in power, I come to tender it, and my appliance, With all bound humbleness.  KING. We thank you, maiden, But may not be so credulous of cure, When our most learned doctors leave us, and The congregated college have concluded That labouring art can never ransom nature From her inaidable estate. I say we must not So stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope, To prostitute our past-cure malady To empirics, or to dissever so Our great self and our credit, to esteem A senseless help, when help past sense we deem.  HELENA. My duty then shall pay me for my pains. I will no more enforce mine office on you, Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts A modest one to bear me back again.  KING. I cannot give thee less, to be call’d grateful. Thou thought’st to help me; and such thanks I give As one near death to those that wish him live. But what at full I know, thou know’st no part; I knowing all my peril, thou no art.  HELENA. What I can do can do no hurt to try, Since you set up your rest ’gainst remedy. He that of greatest works is finisher Oft does them by the weakest minister. So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown, When judges have been babes. Great floods have flown From simple sources, and great seas have dried When miracles have by the great’st been denied. Oft expectation fails, and most oft there Where most it promises; and oft it hits Where hope is coldest, and despair most fits.  KING. I must not hear thee. Fare thee well, kind maid. Thy pains, not us’d, must by thyself be paid; Proffers, not took, reap thanks for their reward.  HELENA. Inspired merit so by breath is barr’d. It is not so with Him that all things knows As ’tis with us that square our guess by shows; But most it is presumption in us when The help of heaven we count the act of men. Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent; Of heaven, not me, make an experiment. I am not an impostor, that proclaim Myself against the level of mine aim, But know I think, and think I know most sure, My art is not past power nor you past cure.  KING. Art thou so confident? Within what space Hop’st thou my cure?  HELENA. The greatest grace lending grace. Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring, Ere twice in murk and occidental damp Moist Hesperus hath quench’d her sleepy lamp; Or four and twenty times the pilot’s glass Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass; What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly, Health shall live free, and sickness freely die.  KING. Upon thy certainty and confidence What dar’st thou venture?  HELENA. Tax of impudence, A strumpet’s boldness, a divulged shame, Traduc’d by odious ballads; my maiden’s name Sear’d otherwise; nay worse of worst extended With vilest torture, let my life be ended.  KING. Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak His powerful sound within an organ weak; And what impossibility would slay In common sense, sense saves another way. Thy life is dear, for all that life can rate Worth name of life in thee hath estimate: Youth, beauty, wisdom, courage, all That happiness and prime can happy call. Thou this to hazard needs must intimate Skill infinite, or monstrous desperate. Sweet practiser, thy physic I will try, That ministers thine own death if I die.  HELENA. If I break time, or flinch in property Of what I spoke, unpitied let me die, And well deserv’d. Not helping, death’s my fee; But if I help, what do you promise me?  KING. Make thy demand.  HELENA. But will you make it even?  KING. Ay, by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven.  HELENA. Then shalt thou give me, with thy kingly hand What husband in thy power I will command: Exempted be from me the arrogance To choose from forth the royal blood of France, My low and humble name to propagate With any branch or image of thy state; But such a one, thy vassal, whom I know Is free for me to ask, thee to bestow.  KING. Here is my hand; the premises observ’d, Thy will by my performance shall be serv’d; So make the choice of thy own time, for I, Thy resolv’d patient, on thee still rely. More should I question thee, and more I must, Though more to know could not be more to trust: From whence thou cam’st, how tended on; but rest Unquestion’d welcome, and undoubted bless’d. Give me some help here, ho! If thou proceed As high as word, my deed shall match thy deed.   [_Flourish. Exeunt._]  SCENE II. Rossillon. A room in the Countess’s palace.   Enter Countess and Clown.  COUNTESS. Come on, sir; I shall now put you to the height of your breeding.  CLOWN. I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught. I know my business is but to the court.  COUNTESS. To the court! Why, what place make you special, when you put off that with such contempt? But to the court!  CLOWN. Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, he may easily put it off at court: he that cannot make a leg, put off’s cap, kiss his hand, and say nothing, has neither leg, hands, lip, nor cap; and indeed such a fellow, to say precisely, were not for the court; but for me, I have an answer will serve all men.  COUNTESS. Marry, that’s a bountiful answer that fits all questions.  CLOWN. It is like a barber’s chair, that fits all buttocks—the pin-buttock, the quatch-buttock, the brawn-buttock, or any buttock.  COUNTESS. Will your answer serve fit to all questions?  CLOWN. As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney, as your French crown for your taffety punk, as Tib’s rush for Tom’s forefinger, as a pancake for Shrove-Tuesday, a morris for May-day, as the nail to his hole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding quean to a wrangling knave, as the nun’s lip to the friar’s mouth; nay, as the pudding to his skin.  COUNTESS. Have you, I say, an answer of such fitness for all questions?  CLOWN. From below your duke to beneath your constable, it will fit any question.  COUNTESS. It must be an answer of most monstrous size that must fit all demands.  CLOWN. But a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned should speak truth of it. Here it is, and all that belongs to’t. Ask me if I am a courtier; it shall do you no harm to learn.  COUNTESS. To be young again, if we could: I will be a fool in question, hoping to be the wiser by your answer. I pray you, sir, are you a courtier?  CLOWN. O Lord, sir! There’s a simple putting off. More, more, a hundred of them.  COUNTESS. Sir, I am a poor friend of yours, that loves you.  CLOWN. O Lord, sir! Thick, thick; spare not me.  COUNTESS. I think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat.  CLOWN. O Lord, sir! Nay, put me to’t, I warrant you.  COUNTESS. You were lately whipp’d, sir, as I think.  CLOWN. O Lord, sir! Spare not me.  COUNTESS. Do you cry ‘O Lord, sir!’ at your whipping, and ‘spare not me’? Indeed your ‘O Lord, sir!’ is very sequent to your whipping. You would answer very well to a whipping, if you were but bound to’t.  CLOWN. I ne’er had worse luck in my life in my ‘O Lord, sir!’ I see things may serve long, but not serve ever.  COUNTESS. I play the noble housewife with the time, to entertain it so merrily with a fool.  CLOWN. O Lord, sir! Why, there’t serves well again.  COUNTESS. An end, sir! To your business. Give Helen this, And urge her to a present answer back. Commend me to my kinsmen and my son. This is not much.  CLOWN. Not much commendation to them?  COUNTESS. Not much employment for you. You understand me?  CLOWN. Most fruitfully. I am there before my legs.  COUNTESS. Haste you again.   [_Exeunt severally._]  SCENE III. Paris. The King’s palace.   Enter Bertram, Lafew and Parolles.  LAFEW. They say miracles are past; and we have our philosophical persons to make modern and familiar things supernatural and causeless. Hence is it that we make trifles of terrors, ensconcing ourselves into seeming knowledge when we should submit ourselves to an unknown fear.  PAROLLES. Why, ’tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath shot out in our latter times.  BERTRAM. And so ’tis.  LAFEW. To be relinquish’d of the artists,—  PAROLLES. So I say; both of Galen and Paracelsus.  LAFEW. Of all the learned and authentic fellows,—  PAROLLES. Right; so I say.  LAFEW. That gave him out incurable,—  PAROLLES. Why, there ’tis; so say I too.  LAFEW. Not to be helped.  PAROLLES. Right; as ’twere a man assur’d of a—  LAFEW. Uncertain life and sure death.  PAROLLES. Just; you say well. So would I have said.  LAFEW. I may truly say, it is a novelty to the world.  PAROLLES. It is indeed; if you will have it in showing, you shall read it in what do you call there?  LAFEW. A showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly actor.  PAROLLES. That’s it; I would have said the very same.  LAFEW. Why, your dolphin is not lustier; fore me, I speak in respect—  PAROLLES. Nay, ’tis strange, ’tis very strange; that is the brief and the tedious of it; and he’s of a most facinerious spirit that will not acknowledge it to be the—  LAFEW. Very hand of heaven.  PAROLLES. Ay, so I say.  LAFEW. In a most weak—  PAROLLES. And debile minister, great power, great transcendence, which should indeed give us a further use to be made than alone the recov’ry of the king, as to be—  LAFEW. Generally thankful.  PAROLLES. I would have said it; you say well. Here comes the king.   Enter King, Helena and Attendants.  LAFEW. Lustique, as the Dutchman says. I’ll like a maid the better, whilst I have a tooth in my head. Why, he’s able to lead her a coranto.  PAROLLES. _Mor du vinager!_ is not this Helen?  LAFEW. Fore God, I think so.  KING. Go, call before me all the lords in court.   [_Exit an Attendant._]  Sit, my preserver, by thy patient’s side, And with this healthful hand, whose banish’d sense Thou has repeal’d, a second time receive The confirmation of my promis’d gift, Which but attends thy naming.   Enter several Lords.  Fair maid, send forth thine eye. This youthful parcel Of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing, O’er whom both sovereign power and father’s voice I have to use. Thy frank election make; Thou hast power to choose, and they none to forsake.  HELENA. To each of you one fair and virtuous mistress Fall, when love please! Marry, to each but one!  LAFEW. I’d give bay curtal and his furniture My mouth no more were broken than these boys’, And writ as little beard.  KING. Peruse them well. Not one of those but had a noble father.   She addresses her to a Lord.  HELENA. Gentlemen, Heaven hath through me restor’d the king to health.  ALL. We understand it, and thank heaven for you.  HELENA. I am a simple maid, and therein wealthiest That I protest I simply am a maid. Please it, your majesty, I have done already. The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me: “We blush that thou shouldst choose; but, be refused, Let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever, We’ll ne’er come there again.”  KING. Make choice; and, see, Who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me.  HELENA. Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly, And to imperial Love, that god most high, Do my sighs stream. [_To first Lord._] Sir, will you hear my suit?  FIRST LORD. And grant it.  HELENA. Thanks, sir; all the rest is mute.  LAFEW. I had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace for my life.  HELENA. [_To second Lord._] The honour, sir, that flames in your fair eyes, Before I speak, too threat’ningly replies. Love make your fortunes twenty times above Her that so wishes, and her humble love!  SECOND LORD. No better, if you please.  HELENA. My wish receive, Which great Love grant; and so I take my leave.  LAFEW. Do all they deny her? An they were sons of mine I’d have them whipp’d; or I would send them to th’ Turk to make eunuchs of.  HELENA. [_To third Lord._] Be not afraid that I your hand should take; I’ll never do you wrong for your own sake. Blessing upon your vows, and in your bed Find fairer fortune, if you ever wed!  LAFEW. These boys are boys of ice, they’ll none have her. Sure, they are bastards to the English; the French ne’er got ’em.  HELENA. [_To fourth Lord._] You are too young, too happy, and too good, To make yourself a son out of my blood.  FOURTH LORD. Fair one, I think not so.  LAFEW. There’s one grape yet. I am sure thy father drank wine. But if thou beest not an ass, I am a youth of fourteen; I have known thee already.  HELENA. [_To Bertram._] I dare not say I take you, but I give Me and my service, ever whilst I live, Into your guiding power. This is the man.  KING. Why, then, young Bertram, take her; she’s thy wife.  BERTRAM. My wife, my liege! I shall beseech your highness, In such a business give me leave to use The help of mine own eyes.  KING. Know’st thou not, Bertram, What she has done for me?  BERTRAM. Yes, my good lord, But never hope to know why I should marry her.  KING. Thou know’st she has rais’d me from my sickly bed.  BERTRAM. But follows it, my lord, to bring me down Must answer for your raising? I know her well; She had her breeding at my father’s charge: A poor physician’s daughter my wife! Disdain Rather corrupt me ever!  KING. ’Tis only title thou disdain’st in her, the which I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods, Of colour, weight, and heat, pour’d all together, Would quite confound distinction, yet stands off In differences so mighty. If she be All that is virtuous, save what thou dislik’st, A poor physician’s daughter,—thou dislik’st— Of virtue for the name. But do not so. From lowest place when virtuous things proceed, The place is dignified by the doer’s deed. Where great additions swell’s, and virtue none, It is a dropsied honour. Good alone Is good without a name; vileness is so: The property by what it is should go, Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair; In these to nature she’s immediate heir; And these breed honour: that is honour’s scorn Which challenges itself as honour’s born, And is not like the sire. Honours thrive When rather from our acts we them derive Than our fore-goers. The mere word’s a slave, Debauch’d on every tomb, on every grave A lying trophy, and as oft is dumb Where dust and damn’d oblivion is the tomb Of honour’d bones indeed. What should be said? If thou canst like this creature as a maid, I can create the rest. Virtue and she Is her own dower; honour and wealth from me.  BERTRAM. I cannot love her, nor will strive to do ’t.  KING. Thou wrong’st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose.  HELENA. That you are well restor’d, my lord, I am glad. Let the rest go.  KING. My honour’s at the stake, which to defeat, I must produce my power. Here, take her hand, Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift, That dost in vile misprision shackle up My love and her desert; that canst not dream We, poising us in her defective scale, Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know It is in us to plant thine honour where We please to have it grow. Check thy contempt; Obey our will, which travails in thy good; Believe not thy disdain, but presently Do thine own fortunes that obedient right Which both thy duty owes and our power claims; Or I will throw thee from my care for ever Into the staggers and the careless lapse Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate Loosing upon thee in the name of justice, Without all terms of pity. Speak! Thine answer!  BERTRAM. Pardon, my gracious lord; for I submit My fancy to your eyes. When I consider What great creation, and what dole of honour Flies where you bid it, I find that she, which late Was in my nobler thoughts most base, is now The praised of the king; who, so ennobled, Is as ’twere born so.  KING. Take her by the hand, And tell her she is thine; to whom I promise A counterpoise; if not to thy estate, A balance more replete.  BERTRAM. I take her hand.  KING. Good fortune and the favour of the king Smile upon this contract; whose ceremony Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief, And be perform’d tonight. The solemn feast Shall more attend upon the coming space, Expecting absent friends. As thou lov’st her, Thy love’s to me religious; else, does err.   [_Exeunt King, Bertram, Helena, Lords, and Attendants._]  LAFEW. Do you hear, monsieur? A word with you.  PAROLLES. Your pleasure, sir.  LAFEW. Your lord and master did well to make his recantation.  PAROLLES. Recantation! My lord! My master!  LAFEW. Ay. Is it not a language I speak?  PAROLLES. A most harsh one, and not to be understood without bloody succeeding. My master!  LAFEW. Are you companion to the Count Rossillon?  PAROLLES. To any count; to all counts; to what is man.  LAFEW. To what is count’s man: count’s master is of another style.  PAROLLES. You are too old, sir; let it satisfy you, you are too old.  LAFEW. I must tell thee, sirrah, I write man; to which title age cannot bring thee.  PAROLLES. What I dare too well do, I dare not do.  LAFEW. I did think thee, for two ordinaries, to be a pretty wise fellow; thou didst make tolerable vent of thy travel; it might pass. Yet the scarfs and the bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me from believing thee a vessel of too great a burden. I have now found thee; when I lose thee again I care not. Yet art thou good for nothing but taking up, and that thou art scarce worth.  PAROLLES. Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee—  LAFEW. Do not plunge thyself too far in anger, lest thou hasten thy trial; which if—Lord have mercy on thee for a hen! So, my good window of lattice, fare thee well; thy casement I need not open, for I look through thee. Give me thy hand.  PAROLLES. My lord, you give me most egregious indignity.  LAFEW. Ay, with all my heart; and thou art worthy of it.  PAROLLES. I have not, my lord, deserv’d it.  LAFEW. Yes, good faith, every dram of it; and I will not bate thee a scruple.  PAROLLES. Well, I shall be wiser.  LAFEW. Ev’n as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to pull at a smack o’ th’ contrary. If ever thou beest bound in thy scarf and beaten, thou shalt find what it is to be proud of thy bondage. I have a desire to hold my acquaintance with thee, or rather my knowledge, that I may say in the default, “He is a man I know.”  PAROLLES. My lord, you do me most insupportable vexation.  LAFEW. I would it were hell-pains for thy sake, and my poor doing eternal; for doing I am past, as I will by thee, in what motion age will give me leave.   [_Exit._]  PAROLLES. Well, thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off me; scurvy, old, filthy, scurvy lord! Well, I must be patient; there is no fettering of authority. I’ll beat him, by my life, if I can meet him with any convenience, an he were double and double a lord. I’ll have no more pity of his age than I would have of—I’ll beat him, and if I could but meet him again.   Enter Lafew.  LAFEW. Sirrah, your lord and master’s married; there’s news for you; you have a new mistress.  PAROLLES. I most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make some reservation of your wrongs. He is my good lord; whom I serve above is my master.  LAFEW. Who? God?  PAROLLES. Ay, sir.  LAFEW. The devil it is that’s thy master. Why dost thou garter up thy arms o’ this fashion? Dost make hose of thy sleeves? Do other servants so? Thou wert best set thy lower part where thy nose stands. By mine honour, if I were but two hours younger, I’d beat thee. Methink’st thou art a general offence, and every man should beat thee. I think thou wast created for men to breathe themselves upon thee.  PAROLLES. This is hard and undeserved measure, my lord.  LAFEW. Go to, sir; you were beaten in Italy for picking a kernel out of a pomegranate; you are a vagabond, and no true traveller. You are more saucy with lords and honourable personages than the commission of your birth and virtue gives you heraldry. You are not worth another word, else I’d call you knave. I leave you.   [_Exit._]   Enter Bertram.  PAROLLES. Good, very good, it is so then. Good, very good; let it be conceal’d awhile.  BERTRAM. Undone, and forfeited to cares for ever!  PAROLLES. What’s the matter, sweetheart?  BERTRAM. Although before the solemn priest I have sworn, I will not bed her.  PAROLLES. What, what, sweetheart?  BERTRAM. O my Parolles, they have married me! I’ll to the Tuscan wars, and never bed her.  PAROLLES. France is a dog-hole, and it no more merits The tread of a man’s foot: to the wars!  BERTRAM. There’s letters from my mother; what th’ import is I know not yet.  PAROLLES. Ay, that would be known. To th’ wars, my boy, to th’ wars! He wears his honour in a box unseen That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home, Spending his manly marrow in her arms, Which should sustain the bound and high curvet Of Mars’s fiery steed. To other regions! France is a stable; we that dwell in’t, jades, Therefore, to th’ war!  BERTRAM. It shall be so; I’ll send her to my house, Acquaint my mother with my hate to her, And wherefore I am fled; write to the king That which I durst not speak. His present gift Shall furnish me to those Italian fields Where noble fellows strike. War is no strife To the dark house and the detested wife.  PAROLLES. Will this caprichio hold in thee, art sure?  BERTRAM. Go with me to my chamber and advise me. I’ll send her straight away. Tomorrow I’ll to the wars, she to her single sorrow.  PAROLLES. Why, these balls bound; there’s noise in it. ’Tis hard: A young man married is a man that’s marr’d. Therefore away, and leave her bravely; go. The king has done you wrong; but hush ’tis so.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IV. Paris. The King’s palace.   Enter Helena and Clown.  HELENA. My mother greets me kindly: is she well?  CLOWN. She is not well, but yet she has her health; she’s very merry, but yet she is not well. But thanks be given, she’s very well, and wants nothing i’ the world; but yet she is not well.  HELENA. If she be very well, what does she ail that she’s not very well?  CLOWN. Truly, she’s very well indeed, but for two things.  HELENA. What two things?  CLOWN. One, that she’s not in heaven, whither God send her quickly! The other, that she’s in earth, from whence God send her quickly!   Enter Parolles.  PAROLLES. Bless you, my fortunate lady!  HELENA. I hope, sir, I have your good will to have mine own good fortune.  PAROLLES. You had my prayers to lead them on; and to keep them on, have them still. O, my knave how does my old lady?  CLOWN. So that you had her wrinkles and I her money, I would she did as you say.  PAROLLES. Why, I say nothing.  CLOWN. Marry, you are the wiser man; for many a man’s tongue shakes out his master’s undoing. To say nothing, to do nothing, to know nothing, and to have nothing, is to be a great part of your title; which is within a very little of nothing.  PAROLLES. Away! Thou art a knave.  CLOWN. You should have said, sir, before a knave thou art a knave; that is before me thou art a knave. This had been truth, sir.  PAROLLES. Go to, thou art a witty fool; I have found thee.  CLOWN. Did you find me in yourself, sir? or were you taught to find me? The search, sir, was profitable; and much fool may you find in you, even to the world’s pleasure and the increase of laughter.  PAROLLES. A good knave, i’ faith, and well fed. Madam, my lord will go away tonight; A very serious business calls on him. The great prerogative and right of love, Which, as your due, time claims, he does acknowledge; But puts it off to a compell’d restraint; Whose want, and whose delay, is strew’d with sweets; Which they distil now in the curbed time, To make the coming hour o’erflow with joy And pleasure drown the brim.  HELENA. What’s his will else?  PAROLLES. That you will take your instant leave o’ the king, And make this haste as your own good proceeding, Strengthen’d with what apology you think May make it probable need.  HELENA. What more commands he?  PAROLLES. That, having this obtain’d, you presently Attend his further pleasure.  HELENA. In everything I wait upon his will.  PAROLLES. I shall report it so.  HELENA. I pray you. Come, sirrah.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE V. Another room in the same.   Enter Lafew and Bertram.  LAFEW. But I hope your lordship thinks not him a soldier.  BERTRAM. Yes, my lord, and of very valiant approof.  LAFEW. You have it from his own deliverance.  BERTRAM. And by other warranted testimony.  LAFEW. Then my dial goes not true; I took this lark for a bunting.  BERTRAM. I do assure you, my lord, he is very great in knowledge, and accordingly valiant.  LAFEW. I have, then, sinned against his experience and transgressed against his valour; and my state that way is dangerous, since I cannot yet find in my heart to repent. Here he comes; I pray you make us friends; I will pursue the amity.   Enter Parolles.  PAROLLES. [_To Bertram._] These things shall be done, sir.  LAFEW. Pray you, sir, who’s his tailor?  PAROLLES. Sir!  LAFEW. O, I know him well, I, sir; he, sir, is a good workman, a very good tailor.  BERTRAM. [_Aside to Parolles._] Is she gone to the king?  PAROLLES. She is.  BERTRAM. Will she away tonight?  PAROLLES. As you’ll have her.  BERTRAM. I have writ my letters, casketed my treasure, Given order for our horses; and tonight, When I should take possession of the bride, End ere I do begin.  LAFEW. A good traveller is something at the latter end of a dinner; but one that lies three-thirds and uses a known truth to pass a thousand nothings with, should be once heard and thrice beaten.— God save you, Captain.  BERTRAM. Is there any unkindness between my lord and you, monsieur?  PAROLLES. I know not how I have deserved to run into my lord’s displeasure.  LAFEW. You have made shift to run into ’t, boots and spurs and all, like him that leapt into the custard; and out of it you’ll run again, rather than suffer question for your residence.  BERTRAM. It may be you have mistaken him, my lord.  LAFEW. And shall do so ever, though I took him at his prayers. Fare you well, my lord; and believe this of me, there can be no kernal in this light nut; the soul of this man is his clothes; trust him not in matter of heavy consequence; I have kept of them tame, and know their natures. Farewell, monsieur; I have spoken better of you than you have or will to deserve at my hand; but we must do good against evil.   [_Exit._]  PAROLLES. An idle lord, I swear.  BERTRAM. I think so.  PAROLLES. Why, do you not know him?  BERTRAM. Yes, I do know him well; and common speech Gives him a worthy pass. Here comes my clog.   Enter Helena.  HELENA. I have, sir, as I was commanded from you, Spoke with the king, and have procur’d his leave For present parting; only he desires Some private speech with you.  BERTRAM. I shall obey his will. You must not marvel, Helen, at my course, Which holds not colour with the time, nor does The ministration and required office On my particular. Prepared I was not For such a business; therefore am I found So much unsettled: this drives me to entreat you; That presently you take your way for home, And rather muse than ask why I entreat you: For my respects are better than they seem; And my appointments have in them a need Greater than shows itself at the first view To you that know them not. This to my mother.   [_Giving a letter._]  ’Twill be two days ere I shall see you; so I leave you to your wisdom.  HELENA. Sir, I can nothing say But that I am your most obedient servant.  BERTRAM. Come, come, no more of that.  HELENA. And ever shall With true observance seek to eke out that Wherein toward me my homely stars have fail’d To equal my great fortune.  BERTRAM. Let that go. My haste is very great. Farewell; hie home.  HELENA. Pray, sir, your pardon.  BERTRAM. Well, what would you say?  HELENA. I am not worthy of the wealth I owe; Nor dare I say ’tis mine, and yet it is; But, like a timorous thief, most fain would steal What law does vouch mine own.  BERTRAM. What would you have?  HELENA. Something; and scarce so much; nothing indeed. I would not tell you what I would, my lord. Faith, yes, Strangers and foes do sunder and not kiss.  BERTRAM. I pray you, stay not, but in haste to horse.  HELENA. I shall not break your bidding, good my lord. Where are my other men, monsieur? Farewell,   [_Exit Helena._]  BERTRAM. Go thou toward home, where I will never come Whilst I can shake my sword or hear the drum. Away, and for our flight.  PAROLLES. Bravely, coragio!   [_Exeunt._]
ACT IV.  SCENE I. Without the Florentine camp.   Enter first Lord with five or six Soldiers in ambush.  FIRST LORD. He can come no other way but by this hedge-corner. When you sally upon him, speak what terrible language you will; though you understand it not yourselves, no matter; for we must not seem to understand him, unless someone among us, whom we must produce for an interpreter.  FIRST SOLDIER. Good captain, let me be th’ interpreter.  FIRST LORD. Art not acquainted with him? Knows he not thy voice?  FIRST SOLDIER. No sir, I warrant you.  FIRST LORD. But what linsey-woolsey has thou to speak to us again?  FIRST SOLDIER. E’en such as you speak to me.  FIRST LORD. He must think us some band of strangers i’ the adversary’s entertainment. Now he hath a smack of all neighbouring languages, therefore we must every one be a man of his own fancy; not to know what we speak one to another, so we seem to know, is to know straight our purpose: choughs’ language, gabble enough, and good enough. As for you, interpreter, you must seem very politic. But couch, ho! Here he comes; to beguile two hours in a sleep, and then to return and swear the lies he forges.   Enter Parolles.  PAROLLES. Ten o’clock. Within these three hours ’twill be time enough to go home. What shall I say I have done? It must be a very plausive invention that carries it. They begin to smoke me, and disgraces have of late knock’d too often at my door. I find my tongue is too foolhardy, but my heart hath the fear of Mars before it, and of his creatures, not daring the reports of my tongue.  FIRST LORD. [_Aside._] This is the first truth that e’er thine own tongue was guilty of.  PAROLLES. What the devil should move me to undertake the recovery of this drum, being not ignorant of the impossibility, and knowing I had no such purpose? I must give myself some hurts, and say I got them in exploit; yet slight ones will not carry it. They will say “Came you off with so little?” and great ones I dare not give. Wherefore, what’s the instance? Tongue, I must put you into a butter-woman’s mouth, and buy myself another of Bajazet’s mule, if you prattle me into these perils.  FIRST LORD. [_Aside._] Is it possible he should know what he is, and be that he is?  PAROLLES. I would the cutting of my garments would serve the turn, or the breaking of my Spanish sword.  FIRST LORD. [_Aside._] We cannot afford you so.  PAROLLES. Or the baring of my beard, and to say it was in stratagem.  FIRST LORD. [_Aside._] ’Twould not do.  PAROLLES. Or to drown my clothes, and say I was stripped.  FIRST LORD. [_Aside._] Hardly serve.  PAROLLES. Though I swore I leap’d from the window of the citadel,—  FIRST LORD. [_Aside._] How deep?  PAROLLES. Thirty fathom.  FIRST LORD. [_Aside._] Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed.  PAROLLES. I would I had any drum of the enemy’s; I would swear I recover’d it.  FIRST LORD. [_Aside._] You shall hear one anon.  PAROLLES. A drum now of the enemy’s!   [_Alarum within._]  FIRST LORD. _Throca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo._  ALL. _Cargo, cargo, cargo, villianda par corbo, cargo._   [_They seize and blindfold him._]  PAROLLES. O, ransom, ransom! Do not hide mine eyes.  FIRST SOLDIER. _Boskos thromuldo boskos._  PAROLLES. I know you are the Muskos’ regiment, And I shall lose my life for want of language. If there be here German, or Dane, Low Dutch, Italian, or French, let him speak to me, I’ll discover that which shall undo the Florentine.  FIRST SOLDIER. _Boskos vauvado._ I understand thee, and can speak thy tongue. _Kerelybonto._ Sir, Betake thee to thy faith, for seventeen poniards are at thy bosom.  PAROLLES. O!  FIRST SOLDIER. O, pray, pray, pray! _Manka revania dulche._  FIRST LORD. _Oscorbidulchos volivorco._  FIRST SOLDIER. The General is content to spare thee yet; And, hoodwink’d as thou art, will lead thee on To gather from thee. Haply thou mayst inform Something to save thy life.  PAROLLES. O, let me live, And all the secrets of our camp I’ll show, Their force, their purposes; nay, I’ll speak that Which you will wonder at.  FIRST SOLDIER. But wilt thou faithfully?  PAROLLES. If I do not, damn me.  FIRST SOLDIER. _Acordo linta._ Come on; thou art granted space.   [_Exit, with Parolles guarded._]   A short alarum within.  FIRST LORD. Go tell the Count Rossillon and my brother We have caught the woodcock, and will keep him muffled Till we do hear from them.  SECOND SOLDIER. Captain, I will.  FIRST LORD. ’A will betray us all unto ourselves; Inform on that.  SECOND SOLDIER. So I will, sir.  FIRST LORD. Till then I’ll keep him dark, and safely lock’d.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. Florence. A room in the Widow’s house.   Enter Bertram and Diana.  BERTRAM. They told me that your name was Fontybell.  DIANA. No, my good lord, Diana.  BERTRAM. Titled goddess; And worth it, with addition! But, fair soul, In your fine frame hath love no quality? If the quick fire of youth light not your mind, You are no maiden but a monument; When you are dead, you should be such a one As you are now; for you are cold and stern, And now you should be as your mother was When your sweet self was got.  DIANA. She then was honest.  BERTRAM. So should you be.  DIANA. No. My mother did but duty; such, my lord, As you owe to your wife.  BERTRAM. No more a’ that! I pr’ythee do not strive against my vows; I was compell’d to her; but I love thee By love’s own sweet constraint, and will for ever Do thee all rights of service.  DIANA. Ay, so you serve us Till we serve you; but when you have our roses, You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves, And mock us with our bareness.  BERTRAM. How have I sworn?  DIANA. ’Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth, But the plain single vow that is vow’d true. What is not holy, that we swear not by, But take the highest to witness: then, pray you, tell me, If I should swear by Jove’s great attributes I lov’d you dearly, would you believe my oaths When I did love you ill? This has no holding, To swear by him whom I protest to love That I will work against him. Therefore your oaths Are words and poor conditions; but unseal’d,— At least in my opinion.  BERTRAM. Change it, change it. Be not so holy-cruel. Love is holy; And my integrity ne’er knew the crafts That you do charge men with. Stand no more off, But give thyself unto my sick desires, Who then recovers. Say thou art mine, and ever My love as it begins shall so persever.  DIANA. I see that men make hopes in such a case, That we’ll forsake ourselves. Give me that ring.  BERTRAM. I’ll lend it thee, my dear, but have no power To give it from me.  DIANA. Will you not, my lord?  BERTRAM. It is an honour ’longing to our house, Bequeathed down from many ancestors, Which were the greatest obloquy i’ the world In me to lose.  DIANA. Mine honour’s such a ring; My chastity’s the jewel of our house, Bequeathed down from many ancestors, Which were the greatest obloquy i’ the world In me to lose. Thus your own proper wisdom Brings in the champion honour on my part Against your vain assault.  BERTRAM. Here, take my ring; My house, mine honour, yea, my life be thine, And I’ll be bid by thee.  DIANA. When midnight comes, knock at my chamber window; I’ll order take my mother shall not hear. Now will I charge you in the band of truth, When you have conquer’d my yet maiden-bed, Remain there but an hour, nor speak to me. My reasons are most strong; and you shall know them When back again this ring shall be deliver’d; And on your finger in the night, I’ll put Another ring, that what in time proceeds May token to the future our past deeds. Adieu till then; then fail not. You have won A wife of me, though there my hope be done.  BERTRAM. A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee.   [_Exit._]  DIANA. For which live long to thank both heaven and me! You may so in the end. My mother told me just how he would woo, As if she sat in’s heart. She says all men Have the like oaths. He had sworn to marry me When his wife’s dead; therefore I’ll lie with him When I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braid, Marry that will, I live and die a maid. Only, in this disguise, I think’t no sin To cozen him that would unjustly win.   [_Exit._]  SCENE III. The Florentine camp.   Enter the two French Lords and two or three Soldiers.  FIRST LORD. You have not given him his mother’s letter?  SECOND LORD. I have deliv’red it an hour since; there is something in’t that stings his nature; for on the reading it, he chang’d almost into another man.  FIRST LORD. He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking off so good a wife and so sweet a lady.  SECOND LORD. Especially he hath incurred the everlasting displeasure of the king, who had even tun’d his bounty to sing happiness to him. I will tell you a thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you.  FIRST LORD. When you have spoken it, ’tis dead, and I am the grave of it.  SECOND LORD. He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in Florence, of a most chaste renown, and this night he fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour; he hath given her his monumental ring, and thinks himself made in the unchaste composition.  FIRST LORD. Now, God delay our rebellion! As we are ourselves, what things are we!  SECOND LORD. Merely our own traitors. And as in the common course of all treasons, we still see them reveal themselves till they attain to their abhorr’d ends; so he that in this action contrives against his own nobility, in his proper stream, o’erflows himself.  FIRST LORD. Is it not meant damnable in us to be trumpeters of our unlawful intents? We shall not then have his company tonight?  SECOND LORD. Not till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour.  FIRST LORD. That approaches apace. I would gladly have him see his company anatomized, that he might take a measure of his own judgments, wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit.  SECOND LORD. We will not meddle with him till he come; for his presence must be the whip of the other.  FIRST LORD. In the meantime, what hear you of these wars?  SECOND LORD. I hear there is an overture of peace.  FIRST LORD. Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded.  SECOND LORD. What will Count Rossillon do then? Will he travel higher, or return again into France?  FIRST LORD. I perceive by this demand, you are not altogether of his council.  SECOND LORD. Let it be forbid, sir! So should I be a great deal of his act.  FIRST LORD. Sir, his wife some two months since fled from his house. Her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques le Grand; which holy undertaking with most austere sanctimony she accomplished; and there residing, the tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her grief; in fine, made a groan of her last breath, and now she sings in heaven.  SECOND LORD. How is this justified?  FIRST LORD. The stronger part of it by her own letters, which makes her story true, even to the point of her death. Her death itself, which could not be her office to say is come, was faithfully confirm’d by the rector of the place.  SECOND LORD. Hath the count all this intelligence?  FIRST LORD. Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from point, to the full arming of the verity.  SECOND LORD. I am heartily sorry that he’ll be glad of this.  FIRST LORD. How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses!  SECOND LORD. And how mightily some other times we drown our gain in tears! The great dignity that his valour hath here acquir’d for him shall at home be encountered with a shame as ample.  FIRST LORD. The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and ill together; our virtues would be proud if our faults whipped them not; and our crimes would despair if they were not cherish’d by our virtues.   Enter a Messenger.  How now? Where’s your master?  MESSENGER. He met the duke in the street, sir; of whom he hath taken a solemn leave: his lordship will next morning for France. The duke hath offered him letters of commendations to the king.  SECOND LORD. They shall be no more than needful there, if they were more than they can commend.   Enter Bertram.  FIRST LORD. They cannot be too sweet for the king’s tartness. Here’s his lordship now. How now, my lord, is’t not after midnight?  BERTRAM. I have tonight despatch’d sixteen businesses, a month’s length apiece; by an abstract of success: I have congied with the duke, done my adieu with his nearest; buried a wife, mourn’d for her, writ to my lady mother I am returning, entertained my convoy, and between these main parcels of despatch effected many nicer needs: the last was the greatest, but that I have not ended yet.  SECOND LORD. If the business be of any difficulty and this morning your departure hence, it requires haste of your lordship.  BERTRAM. I mean the business is not ended, as fearing to hear of it hereafter. But shall we have this dialogue between the Fool and the Soldier? Come, bring forth this counterfeit module has deceiv’d me like a double-meaning prophesier.  SECOND LORD. Bring him forth.   [_Exeunt Soldiers._]  Has sat i’ the stocks all night, poor gallant knave.  BERTRAM. No matter; his heels have deserv’d it, in usurping his spurs so long. How does he carry himself?  FIRST LORD. I have told your lordship already; the stocks carry him. But to answer you as you would be understood: he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk; he hath confessed himself to Morgan, whom he supposes to be a friar, from the time of his remembrance to this very instant disaster of his setting i’ the stocks. And what think you he hath confessed?  BERTRAM. Nothing of me, has he?  SECOND LORD. His confession is taken, and it shall be read to his face; if your lordship be in’t, as I believe you are, you must have the patience to hear it.   Enter Soldiers with Parolles.  BERTRAM. A plague upon him! muffled! he can say nothing of me; hush, hush!  FIRST LORD. Hoodman comes! _Portotartarossa._  FIRST SOLDIER. He calls for the tortures. What will you say without ’em?  PAROLLES. I will confess what I know without constraint. If ye pinch me like a pasty I can say no more.  FIRST SOLDIER. _Bosko chimurcho._  FIRST LORD. _Boblibindo chicurmurco._  FIRST SOLDIER. You are a merciful general. Our general bids you answer to what I shall ask you out of a note.  PAROLLES. And truly, as I hope to live.  FIRST SOLDIER. ‘First demand of him how many horse the duke is strong.’ What say you to that?  PAROLLES. Five or six thousand; but very weak and unserviceable: the troops are all scattered, and the commanders very poor rogues, upon my reputation and credit, and as I hope to live.  FIRST SOLDIER. Shall I set down your answer so?  PAROLLES. Do. I’ll take the sacrament on ’t, how and which way you will.  BERTRAM. All’s one to him. What a past-saving slave is this!  FIRST LORD. You are deceived, my lord; this is Monsieur Parolles, the gallant militarist (that was his own phrase), that had the whole theoric of war in the knot of his scarf, and the practice in the chape of his dagger.  SECOND LORD. I will never trust a man again for keeping his sword clean, nor believe he can have everything in him by wearing his apparel neatly.  FIRST SOLDIER. Well, that’s set down.  PAROLLES. ‘Five or six thousand horse’ I said—I will say true—or thereabouts, set down,—for I’ll speak truth.  FIRST LORD. He’s very near the truth in this.  BERTRAM. But I con him no thanks for’t in the nature he delivers it.  PAROLLES. Poor rogues, I pray you say.  FIRST SOLDIER. Well, that’s set down.  PAROLLES. I humbly thank you, sir; a truth’s a truth, the rogues are marvellous poor.  FIRST SOLDIER. ‘Demand of him of what strength they are a-foot.’ What say you to that?  PAROLLES. By my troth, sir, if I were to live this present hour, I will tell true. Let me see: Spurio, a hundred and fifty, Sebastian, so many; Corambus, so many; Jaques, so many; Guiltian, Cosmo, Lodowick, and Gratii, two hundred fifty each; mine own company, Chitopher, Vaumond, Bentii, two hundred fifty each: so that the muster-file, rotten and sound, upon my life, amounts not to fifteen thousand poll; half of the which dare not shake the snow from off their cassocks lest they shake themselves to pieces.  BERTRAM. What shall be done to him?  FIRST LORD. Nothing, but let him have thanks. Demand of him my condition, and what credit I have with the duke.  FIRST SOLDIER. Well, that’s set down. ‘You shall demand of him whether one Captain Dumaine be i’ the camp, a Frenchman; what his reputation is with the duke, what his valour, honesty and expertness in wars; or whether he thinks it were not possible with well-weighing sums of gold to corrupt him to a revolt.’ What say you to this? What do you know of it?  PAROLLES. I beseech you, let me answer to the particular of the inter’gatories. Demand them singly.  FIRST SOLDIER. Do you know this Captain Dumaine?  PAROLLES. I know him: he was a botcher’s ’prentice in Paris, from whence he was whipped for getting the shrieve’s fool with child, a dumb innocent that could not say him nay.   [_First Lord lifts up his hand in anger._]  BERTRAM. Nay, by your leave, hold your hands; though I know his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls.  FIRST SOLDIER. Well, is this captain in the Duke of Florence’s camp?  PAROLLES. Upon my knowledge, he is, and lousy.  FIRST LORD. Nay, look not so upon me; we shall hear of your lordship anon.  FIRST SOLDIER. What is his reputation with the duke?  PAROLLES. The duke knows him for no other but a poor officer of mine, and writ to me this other day to turn him out o’ the band. I think I have his letter in my pocket.  FIRST SOLDIER. Marry, we’ll search.  PAROLLES. In good sadness, I do not know; either it is there or it is upon a file, with the duke’s other letters, in my tent.  FIRST SOLDIER. Here ’tis; here’s a paper; shall I read it to you?  PAROLLES. I do not know if it be it or no.  BERTRAM. Our interpreter does it well.  FIRST LORD. Excellently.  FIRST SOLDIER. [_Reads._] _Dian, the Count’s a fool, and full of gold._  PAROLLES. That is not the duke’s letter, sir; that is an advertisement to a proper maid in Florence, one Diana, to take heed of the allurement of one Count Rossillon, a foolish idle boy, but for all that very ruttish. I pray you, sir, put it up again.  FIRST SOLDIER. Nay, I’ll read it first by your favour.  PAROLLES. My meaning in’t, I protest, was very honest in the behalf of the maid; for I knew the young count to be a dangerous and lascivious boy, who is a whale to virginity, and devours up all the fry it finds.  BERTRAM. Damnable both sides rogue!  FIRST SOLDIER. [_Reads._] _When he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it; After he scores, he never pays the score. Half won is match well made; match, and well make it; He ne’er pays after-debts, take it before. And say a soldier, ‘Dian,’ told thee this: Men are to mell with, boys are not to kiss; For count of this, the count’s a fool, I know it, Who pays before, but not when he does owe it. Thine, as he vow’d to thee in thine ear,_                                      PAROLLES.  BERTRAM. He shall be whipped through the army with this rhyme in’s forehead.  SECOND LORD. This is your devoted friend, sir, the manifold linguist, and the armipotent soldier.  BERTRAM. I could endure anything before but a cat, and now he’s a cat to me.  FIRST SOLDIER. I perceive, sir, by our general’s looks we shall be fain to hang you.  PAROLLES. My life, sir, in any case. Not that I am afraid to die, but that, my offences being many, I would repent out the remainder of nature. Let me live, sir, in a dungeon, i’ the stocks, or anywhere, so I may live.  FIRST SOLDIER. We’ll see what may be done, so you confess freely. Therefore, once more to this Captain Dumaine: you have answer’d to his reputation with the duke, and to his valour. What is his honesty?  PAROLLES. He will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister: for rapes and ravishments he parallels Nessus. He professes not keeping of oaths; in breaking them he is stronger than Hercules. He will lie, sir, with such volubility that you would think truth were a fool: drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will be swine-drunk, and in his sleep he does little harm, save to his bedclothes about him; but they know his conditions and lay him in straw. I have but little more to say, sir, of his honesty; he has everything that an honest man should not have; what an honest man should have, he has nothing.  FIRST LORD. I begin to love him for this.  BERTRAM. For this description of thine honesty? A pox upon him for me, he’s more and more a cat.  FIRST SOLDIER. What say you to his expertness in war?  PAROLLES. Faith, sir, has led the drum before the English tragedians,—to belie him I will not,—and more of his soldiership I know not, except in that country he had the honour to be the officer at a place there called Mile-end, to instruct for the doubling of files. I would do the man what honour I can, but of this I am not certain.  FIRST LORD. He hath out-villain’d villainy so far that the rarity redeems him.  BERTRAM. A pox on him! He’s a cat still.  FIRST SOLDIER. His qualities being at this poor price, I need not to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt.  PAROLLES. Sir, for a quart d’ecu he will sell the fee-simple of his salvation, the inheritance of it, and cut the entail from all remainders, and a perpetual succession for it perpetually.  FIRST SOLDIER. What’s his brother, the other Captain Dumaine?  SECOND LORD. Why does he ask him of me?  FIRST SOLDIER. What’s he?  PAROLLES. E’en a crow o’ the same nest; not altogether so great as the first in goodness, but greater a great deal in evil. He excels his brother for a coward, yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is. In a retreat he outruns any lackey; marry, in coming on he has the cramp.  FIRST SOLDIER. If your life be saved, will you undertake to betray the Florentine?  PAROLLES. Ay, and the captain of his horse, Count Rossillon.  FIRST SOLDIER. I’ll whisper with the general, and know his pleasure.  PAROLLES. [_Aside._] I’ll no more drumming; a plague of all drums! Only to seem to deserve well, and to beguile the supposition of that lascivious young boy the count, have I run into this danger: yet who would have suspected an ambush where I was taken?  FIRST SOLDIER. There is no remedy, sir, but you must die. The general says you that have so traitorously discovered the secrets of your army, and made such pestiferous reports of men very nobly held, can serve the world for no honest use; therefore you must die. Come, headsman, off with his head.  PAROLLES. O Lord! sir, let me live, or let me see my death.  FIRST SOLDIER. That shall you, and take your leave of all your friends.   [_Unmuffling him._]  So, look about you; know you any here?  BERTRAM. Good morrow, noble captain.  SECOND LORD. God bless you, Captain Parolles.  FIRST LORD. God save you, noble captain.  SECOND LORD. Captain, what greeting will you to my Lord Lafew? I am for France.  FIRST LORD. Good Captain, will you give me a copy of the sonnet you writ to Diana in behalf of the Count Rossillon? And I were not a very coward I’d compel it of you; but fare you well.   [_Exeunt Bertram, Lords &c._]  FIRST SOLDIER. You are undone, captain: all but your scarf; that has a knot on’t yet.  PAROLLES. Who cannot be crushed with a plot?  FIRST SOLDIER. If you could find out a country where but women were that had received so much shame, you might begin an impudent nation. Fare ye well, sir. I am for France too; we shall speak of you there.   [_Exeunt._]  PAROLLES. Yet am I thankful. If my heart were great ’Twould burst at this. Captain I’ll be no more, But I will eat, and drink, and sleep as soft As captain shall. Simply the thing I am Shall make me live. Who knows himself a braggart, Let him fear this; for it will come to pass That every braggart shall be found an ass. Rust, sword; cool, blushes; and, Parolles live Safest in shame; being fool’d, by foolery thrive. There’s place and means for every man alive. I’ll after them.   [_Exit._]  SCENE IV. Florence. A room in the Widow’s house.   Enter Helena, Widow and Diana.  HELENA. That you may well perceive I have not wrong’d you One of the greatest in the Christian world Shall be my surety; fore whose throne ’tis needful, Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel. Time was I did him a desired office, Dear almost as his life; which gratitude Through flinty Tartar’s bosom would peep forth, And answer thanks. I duly am inform’d His grace is at Marseilles; to which place We have convenient convoy. You must know I am supposed dead. The army breaking, My husband hies him home, where, heaven aiding, And by the leave of my good lord the king, We’ll be before our welcome.  WIDOW. Gentle madam, You never had a servant to whose trust Your business was more welcome.  HELENA. Nor you, mistress, Ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labour To recompense your love. Doubt not but heaven Hath brought me up to be your daughter’s dower, As it hath fated her to be my motive And helper to a husband. But, O strange men! That can such sweet use make of what they hate, When saucy trusting of the cozen’d thoughts Defiles the pitchy night; so lust doth play With what it loathes, for that which is away. But more of this hereafter. You, Diana, Under my poor instructions yet must suffer Something in my behalf.  DIANA. Let death and honesty Go with your impositions, I am yours Upon your will to suffer.  HELENA. Yet, I pray you; But with the word the time will bring on summer, When briers shall have leaves as well as thorns, And be as sweet as sharp. We must away; Our waggon is prepar’d, and time revives us. All’s well that ends well; still the fine’s the crown. Whate’er the course, the end is the renown.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE V. Rossillon. A room in the Countess’s palace.   Enter Clown, Countess and Lafew.  LAFEW. No, no, no, your son was misled with a snipt-taffeta fellow there, whose villanous saffron would have made all the unbak’d and doughy youth of a nation in his colour. Your daughter-in-law had been alive at this hour, and your son here at home, more advanc’d by the king than by that red-tail’d humble-bee I speak of.  COUNTESS. I would I had not known him; it was the death of the most virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had praise for creating. If she had partaken of my flesh and cost me the dearest groans of a mother, I could not have owed her a more rooted love.  LAFEW. ’Twas a good lady, ’twas a good lady. We may pick a thousand salads ere we light on such another herb.  CLOWN. Indeed, sir, she was the sweet marjoram of the salad, or, rather, the herb of grace.  LAFEW. They are not herbs, you knave; they are nose-herbs.  CLOWN. I am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir; I have not much skill in grass.  LAFEW. Whether dost thou profess thyself,—a knave or a fool?  CLOWN. A fool, sir, at a woman’s service, and a knave at a man’s.  LAFEW. Your distinction?  CLOWN. I would cozen the man of his wife, and do his service.  LAFEW. So you were a knave at his service indeed.  CLOWN. And I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do her service.  LAFEW. I will subscribe for thee; thou art both knave and fool.  CLOWN. At your service.  LAFEW. No, no, no.  CLOWN. Why, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can serve as great a prince as you are.  LAFEW. Who’s that? a Frenchman?  CLOWN. Faith, sir, ’a has an English name; but his phisnomy is more hotter in France than there.  LAFEW. What prince is that?  CLOWN. The black prince, sir; alias the prince of darkness; alias the devil.  LAFEW. Hold thee, there’s my purse. I give thee not this to suggest thee from thy master thou talk’st of; serve him still.  CLOWN. I am a woodland fellow, sir, that always loved a great fire, and the master I speak of ever keeps a good fire. But sure he is the prince of the world; let his nobility remain in’s court. I am for the house with the narrow gate, which I take to be too little for pomp to enter: some that humble themselves may, but the many will be too chill and tender, and they’ll be for the flow’ry way that leads to the broad gate and the great fire.  LAFEW. Go thy ways, I begin to be a-weary of thee; and I tell thee so before, because I would not fall out with thee. Go thy ways; let my horses be well look’d to, without any tricks.  CLOWN. If I put any tricks upon ’em, sir, they shall be jades’ tricks, which are their own right by the law of nature.   [_Exit._]  LAFEW. A shrewd knave, and an unhappy.  COUNTESS. So he is. My lord that’s gone made himself much sport out of him; by his authority he remains here, which he thinks is a patent for his sauciness; and indeed he has no pace, but runs where he will.  LAFEW. I like him well; ’tis not amiss. And I was about to tell you, since I heard of the good lady’s death, and that my lord your son was upon his return home, I moved the king my master to speak in the behalf of my daughter; which, in the minority of them both, his majesty out of a self-gracious remembrance did first propose. His highness hath promis’d me to do it; and, to stop up the displeasure he hath conceived against your son, there is no fitter matter. How does your ladyship like it?  COUNTESS. With very much content, my lord, and I wish it happily effected.  LAFEW. His highness comes post from Marseilles, of as able body as when he number’d thirty; he will be here tomorrow, or I am deceived by him that in such intelligence hath seldom fail’d.  COUNTESS. It rejoices me that I hope I shall see him ere I die. I have letters that my son will be here tonight. I shall beseech your lordship to remain with me till they meet together.  LAFEW. Madam, I was thinking with what manners I might safely be admitted.  COUNTESS. You need but plead your honourable privilege.  LAFEW. Lady, of that I have made a bold charter; but, I thank my God, it holds yet.   Enter Clown.  CLOWN. O madam, yonder’s my lord your son with a patch of velvet on’s face; whether there be a scar under’t or no, the velvet knows; but ’tis a goodly patch of velvet. His left cheek is a cheek of two pile and a half, but his right cheek is worn bare.  LAFEW. A scar nobly got, or a noble scar, is a good livery of honour; so belike is that.  CLOWN. But it is your carbonado’d face.  LAFEW. Let us go see your son, I pray you. I long to talk with the young noble soldier.  CLOWN. Faith, there’s a dozen of ’em, with delicate fine hats, and most courteous feathers, which bow the head and nod at every man.   [_Exeunt._]
ACT V.  SCENE I. Marseilles. A street.   Enter Helena, Widow and Diana with two Attendants.  HELENA. But this exceeding posting day and night Must wear your spirits low. We cannot help it. But since you have made the days and nights as one, To wear your gentle limbs in my affairs, Be bold you do so grow in my requital As nothing can unroot you. In happy time;—   Enter a Gentleman.  This man may help me to his majesty’s ear, If he would spend his power. God save you, sir.  GENTLEMAN. And you.  HELENA. Sir, I have seen you in the court of France.  GENTLEMAN. I have been sometimes there.  HELENA. I do presume, sir, that you are not fallen From the report that goes upon your goodness; And therefore, goaded with most sharp occasions, Which lay nice manners by, I put you to The use of your own virtues, for the which I shall continue thankful.  GENTLEMAN. What’s your will?  HELENA. That it will please you To give this poor petition to the king, And aid me with that store of power you have To come into his presence.  GENTLEMAN. The king’s not here.  HELENA. Not here, sir?  GENTLEMAN. Not indeed. He hence remov’d last night, and with more haste Than is his use.  WIDOW. Lord, how we lose our pains!  HELENA. All’s well that ends well yet, Though time seem so adverse and means unfit. I do beseech you, whither is he gone?  GENTLEMAN. Marry, as I take it, to Rossillon; Whither I am going.  HELENA. I do beseech you, sir, Since you are like to see the king before me, Commend the paper to his gracious hand, Which I presume shall render you no blame, But rather make you thank your pains for it. I will come after you with what good speed Our means will make us means.  GENTLEMAN. This I’ll do for you.  HELENA. And you shall find yourself to be well thank’d, Whate’er falls more. We must to horse again. Go, go, provide.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. Rossillon. The inner court of the Countess’s palace.   Enter Clown and Parolles.  PAROLLES. Good Monsieur Lavache, give my Lord Lafew this letter; I have ere now, sir, been better known to you, when I have held familiarity with fresher clothes; but I am now, sir, muddied in Fortune’s mood, and smell somewhat strong of her strong displeasure.  CLOWN. Truly, Fortune’s displeasure is but sluttish, if it smell so strongly as thou speak’st of. I will henceforth eat no fish of Fortune’s buttering. Pr’ythee, allow the wind.  PAROLLES. Nay, you need not to stop your nose, sir. I spake but by a metaphor.  CLOWN. Indeed, sir, if your metaphor stink, I will stop my nose, or against any man’s metaphor. Pr’ythee, get thee further.  PAROLLES. Pray you, sir, deliver me this paper.  CLOWN. Foh, pr’ythee stand away. A paper from Fortune’s close-stool to give to a nobleman! Look here he comes himself.   Enter Lafew.  Here is a pur of Fortune’s, sir, or of Fortune’s cat, but not a musk-cat, that has fallen into the unclean fishpond of her displeasure, and as he says, is muddied withal. Pray you, sir, use the carp as you may, for he looks like a poor, decayed, ingenious, foolish, rascally knave. I do pity his distress in my similes of comfort, and leave him to your lordship.   [_Exit._]  PAROLLES. My lord, I am a man whom Fortune hath cruelly scratch’d.  LAFEW. And what would you have me to do? ’Tis too late to pare her nails now. Wherein have you played the knave with Fortune that she should scratch you, who of herself is a good lady, and would not have knaves thrive long under her? There’s a quart d’ecu for you. Let the justices make you and Fortune friends; I am for other business.  PAROLLES. I beseech your honour to hear me one single word.  LAFEW. You beg a single penny more. Come, you shall ha’t; save your word.  PAROLLES. My name, my good lord, is Parolles.  LAFEW. You beg more than word then. Cox my passion! Give me your hand. How does your drum?  PAROLLES. O my good lord, you were the first that found me.  LAFEW. Was I, in sooth? And I was the first that lost thee.  PAROLLES. It lies in you, my lord, to bring me in some grace, for you did bring me out.  LAFEW. Out upon thee, knave! dost thou put upon me at once both the office of God and the devil? One brings thee in grace, and the other brings thee out.   [_Trumpets sound._]  The king’s coming; I know by his trumpets. Sirrah, inquire further after me. I had talk of you last night; though you are a fool and a knave, you shall eat. Go to; follow.  PAROLLES. I praise God for you.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. The same. A room in the Countess’s palace.   Flourish. Enter King, Countess, Lafew, Lords, Gentlemen, Guards &c.  KING. We lost a jewel of her, and our esteem Was made much poorer by it; but your son, As mad in folly, lack’d the sense to know Her estimation home.  COUNTESS. ’Tis past, my liege, And I beseech your majesty to make it Natural rebellion, done i’ the blaze of youth, When oil and fire, too strong for reason’s force, O’erbears it and burns on.  KING. My honour’d lady, I have forgiven and forgotten all, Though my revenges were high bent upon him, And watch’d the time to shoot.  LAFEW. This I must say,— But first, I beg my pardon,—the young lord Did to his majesty, his mother, and his lady, Offence of mighty note; but to himself The greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife Whose beauty did astonish the survey Of richest eyes; whose words all ears took captive; Whose dear perfection hearts that scorn’d to serve Humbly call’d mistress.  KING. Praising what is lost Makes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither; We are reconcil’d, and the first view shall kill All repetition. Let him not ask our pardon; The nature of his great offence is dead, And deeper than oblivion do we bury Th’ incensing relics of it. Let him approach A stranger, no offender; and inform him So ’tis our will he should.  GENTLEMAN. I shall, my liege.   [_Exit Gentleman._]  KING. What says he to your daughter? Have you spoke?  LAFEW. All that he is hath reference to your highness.  KING. Then shall we have a match. I have letters sent me That sets him high in fame.   Enter Bertram.  LAFEW. He looks well on ’t.  KING. I am not a day of season, For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail In me at once. But to the brightest beams Distracted clouds give way; so stand thou forth; The time is fair again.  BERTRAM. My high-repented blames Dear sovereign, pardon to me.  KING. All is whole. Not one word more of the consumed time. Let’s take the instant by the forward top; For we are old, and on our quick’st decrees Th’inaudible and noiseless foot of time Steals ere we can effect them. You remember The daughter of this lord?  BERTRAM. Admiringly, my liege. At first I stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart Durst make too bold herald of my tongue: Where the impression of mine eye infixing, Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me, Which warp’d the line of every other favour, Scorn’d a fair colour, or express’d it stolen, Extended or contracted all proportions To a most hideous object. Thence it came That she whom all men prais’d, and whom myself, Since I have lost, have lov’d, was in mine eye The dust that did offend it.  KING. Well excus’d: That thou didst love her, strikes some scores away From the great compt: but love that comes too late, Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried, To the great sender turns a sour offence, Crying, That’s good that’s gone. Our rash faults Make trivial price of serious things we have, Not knowing them until we know their grave. Oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust, Destroy our friends, and after weep their dust: Our own love waking cries to see what’s done, While shameful hate sleeps out the afternoon. Be this sweet Helen’s knell, and now forget her. Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin. The main consents are had, and here we’ll stay To see our widower’s second marriage-day.  COUNTESS. Which better than the first, O dear heaven, bless! Or, ere they meet, in me, O nature, cesse!  LAFEW. Come on, my son, in whom my house’s name Must be digested; give a favour from you, To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter, That she may quickly come.   [_Bertram gives a ring to Lafew._]  By my old beard, And ev’ry hair that’s on ’t, Helen that’s dead Was a sweet creature: such a ring as this, The last that e’er I took her leave at court, I saw upon her finger.  BERTRAM. Hers it was not.  KING. Now, pray you, let me see it; for mine eye, While I was speaking, oft was fasten’d to it. This ring was mine; and when I gave it Helen I bade her, if her fortunes ever stood Necessitied to help, that by this token I would relieve her. Had you that craft to ’reave her Of what should stead her most?  BERTRAM. My gracious sovereign, Howe’er it pleases you to take it so, The ring was never hers.  COUNTESS. Son, on my life, I have seen her wear it; and she reckon’d it At her life’s rate.  LAFEW. I am sure I saw her wear it.  BERTRAM. You are deceiv’d, my lord; she never saw it. In Florence was it from a casement thrown me, Wrapp’d in a paper, which contain’d the name Of her that threw it. Noble she was, and thought I stood engag’d; but when I had subscrib’d To mine own fortune, and inform’d her fully I could not answer in that course of honour As she had made the overture, she ceas’d, In heavy satisfaction, and would never Receive the ring again.  KING. Plutus himself, That knows the tinct and multiplying medicine, Hath not in nature’s mystery more science Than I have in this ring. ’Twas mine, ’twas Helen’s, Whoever gave it you. Then if you know That you are well acquainted with yourself, Confess ’twas hers, and by what rough enforcement You got it from her. She call’d the saints to surety That she would never put it from her finger Unless she gave it to yourself in bed, Where you have never come, or sent it us Upon her great disaster.  BERTRAM. She never saw it.  KING. Thou speak’st it falsely, as I love mine honour, And mak’st conjectural fears to come into me Which I would fain shut out. If it should prove That thou art so inhuman,—’twill not prove so: And yet I know not, thou didst hate her deadly. And she is dead; which nothing but to close Her eyes myself, could win me to believe More than to see this ring. Take him away.   [_Guards seize Bertram._]  My fore-past proofs, howe’er the matter fall, Shall tax my fears of little vanity, Having vainly fear’d too little. Away with him. We’ll sift this matter further.  BERTRAM. If you shall prove This ring was ever hers, you shall as easy Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence, Where she yet never was.   [_Exit, guarded._]  KING. I am wrapp’d in dismal thinkings.   Enter a Gentleman.  GENTLEMAN. Gracious sovereign, Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not: Here’s a petition from a Florentine, Who hath for four or five removes come short To tender it herself. I undertook it, Vanquish’d thereto by the fair grace and speech Of the poor suppliant, who by this, I know, Is here attending: her business looks in her With an importing visage, and she told me In a sweet verbal brief, it did concern Your highness with herself.  KING. [_Reads._] _Upon his many protestations to marry me when his wife was dead, I blush to say it, he won me. Now is the Count Rossillon a widower; his vows are forfeited to me, and my honour’s paid to him. He stole from Florence, taking no leave, and I follow him to his country for justice. Grant it me, O king, in you it best lies; otherwise a seducer flourishes, and a poor maid is undone._                                     DIANA CAPILET.  LAFEW. I will buy me a son-in-law in a fair, and toll for this. I’ll none of him.  KING. The heavens have thought well on thee, Lafew, To bring forth this discovery. Seek these suitors. Go speedily, and bring again the count.   [_Exeunt Gentleman and some Attendants._]  I am afeard the life of Helen, lady, Was foully snatch’d.  COUNTESS. Now, justice on the doers!   Enter Bertram, guarded.  KING. I wonder, sir, since wives are monsters to you, And that you fly them as you swear them lordship, Yet you desire to marry. What woman’s that?   Enter Widow and Diana.  DIANA. I am, my lord, a wretched Florentine, Derived from the ancient Capilet; My suit, as I do understand, you know, And therefore know how far I may be pitied.  WIDOW. I am her mother, sir, whose age and honour Both suffer under this complaint we bring, And both shall cease, without your remedy.  KING. Come hither, count; do you know these women?  BERTRAM. My lord, I neither can nor will deny But that I know them. Do they charge me further?  DIANA. Why do you look so strange upon your wife?  BERTRAM. She’s none of mine, my lord.  DIANA. If you shall marry, You give away this hand, and that is mine, You give away heaven’s vows, and those are mine, You give away myself, which is known mine; For I by vow am so embodied yours That she which marries you must marry me, Either both or none.  LAFEW. [_To Bertram_] Your reputation comes too short for my daughter; you are no husband for her.  BERTRAM. My lord, this is a fond and desperate creature Whom sometime I have laugh’d with. Let your highness Lay a more noble thought upon mine honour Than for to think that I would sink it here.  KING. Sir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend Till your deeds gain them; fairer prove your honour Than in my thought it lies!  DIANA. Good my lord, Ask him upon his oath, if he does think He had not my virginity.  KING. What say’st thou to her?  BERTRAM. She’s impudent, my lord, And was a common gamester to the camp.  DIANA. He does me wrong, my lord; if I were so He might have bought me at a common price. Do not believe him. O, behold this ring, Whose high respect and rich validity Did lack a parallel; yet for all that He gave it to a commoner o’ the camp, If I be one.  COUNTESS. He blushes, and ’tis it. Of six preceding ancestors, that gem Conferr’d by testament to th’ sequent issue, Hath it been owed and worn. This is his wife; That ring’s a thousand proofs.  KING. Methought you said You saw one here in court could witness it.  DIANA. I did, my lord, but loath am to produce So bad an instrument; his name’s Parolles.  LAFEW. I saw the man today, if man he be.  KING. Find him, and bring him hither.   [_Exit an Attendant._]  BERTRAM. What of him? He’s quoted for a most perfidious slave, With all the spots o’ the world tax’d and debauch’d: Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth. Am I or that or this for what he’ll utter, That will speak anything?  KING. She hath that ring of yours.  BERTRAM. I think she has. Certain it is I lik’d her And boarded her i’ the wanton way of youth. She knew her distance, and did angle for me, Madding my eagerness with her restraint, As all impediments in fancy’s course Are motives of more fancy; and in fine, Her infinite cunning with her modern grace, Subdu’d me to her rate; she got the ring, And I had that which any inferior might At market-price have bought.  DIANA. I must be patient. You that have turn’d off a first so noble wife May justly diet me. I pray you yet,— Since you lack virtue, I will lose a husband— Send for your ring, I will return it home, And give me mine again.  BERTRAM. I have it not.  KING. What ring was yours, I pray you?  DIANA. Sir, much like The same upon your finger.  KING. Know you this ring? This ring was his of late.  DIANA. And this was it I gave him, being abed.  KING. The story then goes false you threw it him Out of a casement.  DIANA. I have spoke the truth.   Enter Attendant with Parolles.  BERTRAM. My lord, I do confess the ring was hers.  KING. You boggle shrewdly; every feather starts you. Is this the man you speak of?  DIANA. Ay, my lord.  KING. Tell me, sirrah, but tell me true I charge you, Not fearing the displeasure of your master, Which on your just proceeding, I’ll keep off,— By him and by this woman here what know you?  PAROLLES. So please your majesty, my master hath been an honourable gentleman. Tricks he hath had in him, which gentlemen have.  KING. Come, come, to the purpose. Did he love this woman?  PAROLLES. Faith, sir, he did love her; but how?  KING. How, I pray you?  PAROLLES. He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman.  KING. How is that?  PAROLLES. He lov’d her, sir, and lov’d her not.  KING. As thou art a knave and no knave. What an equivocal companion is this!  PAROLLES. I am a poor man, and at your majesty’s command.  LAFEW. He’s a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator.  DIANA. Do you know he promised me marriage?  PAROLLES. Faith, I know more than I’ll speak.  KING. But wilt thou not speak all thou know’st?  PAROLLES. Yes, so please your majesty. I did go between them as I said; but more than that, he loved her, for indeed he was mad for her, and talked of Satan, and of Limbo, and of furies, and I know not what: yet I was in that credit with them at that time that I knew of their going to bed; and of other motions, as promising her marriage, and things which would derive me ill will to speak of; therefore I will not speak what I know.  KING. Thou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst say they are married; but thou art too fine in thy evidence; therefore stand aside. This ring, you say, was yours?  DIANA. Ay, my good lord.  KING. Where did you buy it? Or who gave it you?  DIANA. It was not given me, nor I did not buy it.  KING. Who lent it you?  DIANA. It was not lent me neither.  KING. Where did you find it then?  DIANA. I found it not.  KING. If it were yours by none of all these ways, How could you give it him?  DIANA. I never gave it him.  LAFEW. This woman’s an easy glove, my lord; she goes off and on at pleasure.  KING. This ring was mine, I gave it his first wife.  DIANA. It might be yours or hers for ought I know.  KING. Take her away, I do not like her now. To prison with her. And away with him. Unless thou tell’st me where thou hadst this ring, Thou diest within this hour.  DIANA. I’ll never tell you.  KING. Take her away.  DIANA. I’ll put in bail, my liege.  KING. I think thee now some common customer.  DIANA. By Jove, if ever I knew man, ’twas you.  KING. Wherefore hast thou accus’d him all this while?  DIANA. Because he’s guilty, and he is not guilty. He knows I am no maid, and he’ll swear to’t: I’ll swear I am a maid, and he knows not. Great King, I am no strumpet, by my life; I am either maid, or else this old man’s wife.   [_Pointing to Lafew._]  KING. She does abuse our ears; to prison with her.  DIANA. Good mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir;   [_Exit Widow._]  The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for, And he shall surety me. But for this lord Who hath abus’d me as he knows himself, Though yet he never harm’d me, here I quit him. He knows himself my bed he hath defil’d; And at that time he got his wife with child. Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick; So there’s my riddle: one that’s dead is quick, And now behold the meaning.   Enter Widow with Helena.  KING. Is there no exorcist Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes? Is’t real that I see?  HELENA. No, my good lord; ’Tis but the shadow of a wife you see, The name, and not the thing.  BERTRAM. Both, both. O, pardon!  HELENA. O, my good lord, when I was like this maid; I found you wondrous kind. There is your ring, And, look you, here’s your letter. This it says, ‘When from my finger you can get this ring, And is by me with child, &c.’ This is done; Will you be mine now you are doubly won?  BERTRAM. If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly, I’ll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.  HELENA. If it appear not plain, and prove untrue, Deadly divorce step between me and you! O my dear mother, do I see you living?  LAFEW. Mine eyes smell onions; I shall weep anon. [_to Parolles_] Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher. So, I thank thee. Wait on me home, I’ll make sport with thee. Let thy courtesies alone, they are scurvy ones.  KING. Let us from point to point this story know, To make the even truth in pleasure flow. [_To Diana._] If thou beest yet a fresh uncropped flower, Choose thou thy husband, and I’ll pay thy dower; For I can guess that by thy honest aid, Thou kept’st a wife herself, thyself a maid. Of that and all the progress more and less, Resolvedly more leisure shall express. All yet seems well, and if it end so meet, The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet.   [_Flourish._]  [EPILOGUE]  _The king’s a beggar, now the play is done; All is well ended if this suit be won, That you express content; which we will pay With strife to please you, day exceeding day. Ours be your patience then, and yours our parts; Your gentle hands lend us, and take our hearts._   [_Exeunt omnes._]

  ACT I
  ACT II
SCENE I. Messina. A Room in Pompey’s house.   Enter Pompey, Menecrates and Menas in warlike manner.  POMPEY. If the great gods be just, they shall assist The deeds of justest men.  MENECRATES. Know, worthy Pompey, That what they do delay they not deny.  POMPEY. Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays The thing we sue for.  MENECRATES. We, ignorant of ourselves, Beg often our own harms, which the wise powers Deny us for our good; so find we profit By losing of our prayers.  POMPEY. I shall do well. The people love me, and the sea is mine; My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope Says it will come to th’ full. Mark Antony In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make No wars without doors. Caesar gets money where He loses hearts. Lepidus flatters both, Of both is flattered; but he neither loves Nor either cares for him.  MENAS. Caesar and Lepidus Are in the field. A mighty strength they carry.  POMPEY. Where have you this? ’Tis false.  MENAS. From Silvius, sir.  POMPEY. He dreams. I know they are in Rome together, Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love, Salt Cleopatra, soften thy waned lip! Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both; Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts; Keep his brain fuming. Epicurean cooks Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite, That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour Even till a Lethe’d dullness—   Enter Varrius.  How now, Varrius!  VARRIUS. This is most certain that I shall deliver: Mark Antony is every hour in Rome Expected. Since he went from Egypt ’tis A space for farther travel.  POMPEY. I could have given less matter A better ear.—Menas, I did not think This amorous surfeiter would have donned his helm For such a petty war. His soldiership Is twice the other twain. But let us rear The higher our opinion, that our stirring Can from the lap of Egypt’s widow pluck The ne’er lust-wearied Antony.  MENAS. I cannot hope Caesar and Antony shall well greet together. His wife that’s dead did trespasses to Caesar; His brother warred upon him, although I think, Not moved by Antony.  POMPEY. I know not, Menas, How lesser enmities may give way to greater. Were’t not that we stand up against them all, ’Twere pregnant they should square between themselves, For they have entertained cause enough To draw their swords. But how the fear of us May cement their divisions, and bind up The petty difference, we yet not know. Be’t as our gods will have’t! It only stands Our lives upon to use our strongest hands. Come, Menas.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. Rome. A Room in the House of Lepidus.   Enter Enobarbus and Lepidus.  LEPIDUS. Good Enobarbus, ’tis a worthy deed, And shall become you well, to entreat your captain To soft and gentle speech.  ENOBARBUS. I shall entreat him To answer like himself. If Caesar move him, Let Antony look over Caesar’s head And speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter, Were I the wearer of Antonius’ beard, I would not shave’t today.  LEPIDUS. ’Tis not a time For private stomaching.  ENOBARBUS. Every time Serves for the matter that is then born in’t.  LEPIDUS. But small to greater matters must give way.  ENOBARBUS. Not if the small come first.  LEPIDUS. Your speech is passion; But pray you stir no embers up. Here comes The noble Antony.   Enter Antony and Ventidius.  ENOBARBUS. And yonder Caesar.   Enter Caesar, Maecenas and Agrippa.  ANTONY. If we compose well here, to Parthia. Hark, Ventidius.  CAESAR. I do not know, Maecenas. Ask Agrippa.  LEPIDUS. Noble friends, That which combined us was most great, and let not A leaner action rend us. What’s amiss, May it be gently heard. When we debate Our trivial difference loud, we do commit Murder in healing wounds. Then, noble partners, The rather for I earnestly beseech, Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms, Nor curstness grow to th’ matter.  ANTONY. ’Tis spoken well. Were we before our armies, and to fight, I should do thus.  CAESAR. Welcome to Rome.  ANTONY. Thank you.  CAESAR. Sit.  ANTONY. Sit, sir.  CAESAR. Nay, then.  ANTONY. I learn you take things ill which are not so, Or being, concern you not.  CAESAR. I must be laughed at If, or for nothing or a little, I Should say myself offended, and with you Chiefly i’ th’ world; more laughed at that I should Once name you derogately when to sound your name It not concerned me.  ANTONY. My being in Egypt, Caesar, What was’t to you?  CAESAR. No more than my residing here at Rome Might be to you in Egypt. Yet if you there Did practise on my state, your being in Egypt Might be my question.  ANTONY. How intend you, practised?  CAESAR. You may be pleased to catch at mine intent By what did here befall me. Your wife and brother Made wars upon me, and their contestation Was theme for you; you were the word of war.  ANTONY. You do mistake your business. My brother never Did urge me in his act. I did inquire it, And have my learning from some true reports That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather Discredit my authority with yours, And make the wars alike against my stomach, Having alike your cause? Of this my letters Before did satisfy you. If you’ll patch a quarrel, As matter whole you have not to make it with, It must not be with this.  CAESAR. You praise yourself By laying defects of judgment to me; but You patched up your excuses.  ANTONY. Not so, not so. I know you could not lack—I am certain on’t— Very necessity of this thought, that I, Your partner in the cause ’gainst which he fought, Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife, I would you had her spirit in such another. The third o’ th’ world is yours, which with a snaffle You may pace easy, but not such a wife.  ENOBARBUS. Would we had all such wives, that the men Might go to wars with the women.  ANTONY. So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar, Made out of her impatience—which not wanted Shrewdness of policy too—I grieving grant Did you too much disquiet. For that you must But say I could not help it.  CAESAR. I wrote to you When rioting in Alexandria; you Did pocket up my letters, and with taunts Did gibe my missive out of audience.  ANTONY. Sir, He fell upon me ere admitted, then. Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want Of what I was i’ th’ morning. But next day I told him of myself, which was as much As to have asked him pardon. Let this fellow Be nothing of our strife; if we contend, Out of our question wipe him.  CAESAR. You have broken The article of your oath, which you shall never Have tongue to charge me with.  LEPIDUS. Soft, Caesar!  ANTONY. No, Lepidus, let him speak. The honour is sacred which he talks on now, Supposing that I lacked it. But on, Caesar: The article of my oath?  CAESAR. To lend me arms and aid when I required them, The which you both denied.  ANTONY. Neglected, rather; And then when poisoned hours had bound me up From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may I’ll play the penitent to you. But mine honesty Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power Work without it. Truth is that Fulvia, To have me out of Egypt, made wars here, For which myself, the ignorant motive, do So far ask pardon as befits mine honour To stoop in such a case.  LEPIDUS. ’Tis noble spoken.  MAECENAS. If it might please you to enforce no further The griefs between ye; to forget them quite Were to remember that the present need Speaks to atone you.  LEPIDUS. Worthily spoken, Maecenas.  ENOBARBUS. Or, if you borrow one another’s love for the instant, you may, when you hear no more words of Pompey, return it again. You shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do.  ANTONY. Thou art a soldier only. Speak no more.  ENOBARBUS. That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.  ANTONY. You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.  ENOBARBUS. Go to, then. Your considerate stone!  CAESAR. I do not much dislike the matter, but The manner of his speech; for’t cannot be We shall remain in friendship, our conditions So differing in their acts. Yet if I knew What hoop should hold us staunch, from edge to edge O’ th’ world I would pursue it.  AGRIPPA. Give me leave, Caesar.  CAESAR. Speak, Agrippa.  AGRIPPA. Thou hast a sister by the mother’s side, Admired Octavia. Great Mark Antony Is now a widower.  CAESAR. Say not so, Agrippa. If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof Were well deserved of rashness.  ANTONY. I am not married, Caesar. Let me hear Agrippa further speak.  AGRIPPA. To hold you in perpetual amity, To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts With an unslipping knot, take Antony Octavia to his wife; whose beauty claims No worse a husband than the best of men; Whose virtue and whose general graces speak That which none else can utter. By this marriage All little jealousies, which now seem great, And all great fears, which now import their dangers, Would then be nothing. Truths would be tales, Where now half-tales be truths. Her love to both Would each to other, and all loves to both, Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke, For ’tis a studied, not a present thought, By duty ruminated.  ANTONY. Will Caesar speak?  CAESAR. Not till he hears how Antony is touched With what is spoke already.  ANTONY. What power is in Agrippa, If I would say “Agrippa, be it so,” To make this good?  CAESAR. The power of Caesar, and His power unto Octavia.  ANTONY. May I never To this good purpose, that so fairly shows, Dream of impediment! Let me have thy hand. Further this act of grace; and from this hour The heart of brothers govern in our loves And sway our great designs!  CAESAR. There’s my hand. A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother Did ever love so dearly. Let her live To join our kingdoms and our hearts; and never Fly off our loves again!  LEPIDUS. Happily, amen!  ANTONY. I did not think to draw my sword ’gainst Pompey, For he hath laid strange courtesies and great Of late upon me. I must thank him only, Lest my remembrance suffer ill report; At heel of that, defy him.  LEPIDUS. Time calls upon ’s. Of us must Pompey presently be sought, Or else he seeks out us.  ANTONY. Where lies he?  CAESAR. About the Mount Misena.  ANTONY. What is his strength by land?  CAESAR. Great and increasing; but by sea He is an absolute master.  ANTONY. So is the fame. Would we had spoke together! Haste we for it. Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch we The business we have talked of.  CAESAR. With most gladness, And do invite you to my sister’s view, Whither straight I’ll lead you.  ANTONY. Let us, Lepidus, not lack your company.  LEPIDUS. Noble Antony, not sickness should detain me.   [_Flourish. Exeunt all except Enobarbus, Agrippa and Maecenas._]  MAECENAS. Welcome from Egypt, sir.  ENOBARBUS. Half the heart of Caesar, worthy Maecenas! My honourable friend, Agrippa!  AGRIPPA. Good Enobarbus!  MAECENAS. We have cause to be glad that matters are so well digested. You stayed well by ’t in Egypt.  ENOBARBUS. Ay, sir, we did sleep day out of countenance and made the night light with drinking.  MAECENAS. Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and but twelve persons there. Is this true?  ENOBARBUS. This was but as a fly by an eagle. We had much more monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting.  MAECENAS. She’s a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her.  ENOBARBUS. When she first met Mark Antony, she pursed up his heart upon the river of Cydnus.  AGRIPPA. There she appeared indeed, or my reporter devised well for her.  ENOBARBUS. I will tell you. The barge she sat in, like a burnished throne, Burned on the water. The poop was beaten gold; Purple the sails, and so perfumed that The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver, Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made The water which they beat to follow faster, As amorous of their strokes. For her own person, It beggared all description: she did lie In her pavilion, cloth-of-gold of tissue, O’erpicturing that Venus where we see The fancy outwork nature. On each side her Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids, With divers-coloured fans, whose wind did seem To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool, And what they undid did.  AGRIPPA. O, rare for Antony!  ENOBARBUS. Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides, So many mermaids, tended her i’ th’ eyes, And made their bends adornings. At the helm A seeming mermaid steers. The silken tackle Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands That yarely frame the office. From the barge A strange invisible perfume hits the sense Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast Her people out upon her, and Antony, Enthroned i’ th’ market-place, did sit alone, Whistling to th’ air, which, but for vacancy, Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too, And made a gap in nature.  AGRIPPA. Rare Egyptian!  ENOBARBUS. Upon her landing, Antony sent to her, Invited her to supper. She replied It should be better he became her guest, Which she entreated. Our courteous Antony, Whom ne’er the word of “No” woman heard speak, Being barbered ten times o’er, goes to the feast, And, for his ordinary, pays his heart For what his eyes eat only.  AGRIPPA. Royal wench! She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed. He ploughed her, and she cropped.  ENOBARBUS. I saw her once Hop forty paces through the public street And, having lost her breath, she spoke and panted, That she did make defect perfection, And, breathless, pour breath forth.  MAECENAS. Now Antony must leave her utterly.  ENOBARBUS. Never. He will not. Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale Her infinite variety. Other women cloy The appetites they feed, but she makes hungry Where most she satisfies. For vilest things Become themselves in her, that the holy priests Bless her when she is riggish.  MAECENAS. If beauty, wisdom, modesty can settle The heart of Antony, Octavia is A blessed lottery to him.  AGRIPPA. Let us go. Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guest Whilst you abide here.  ENOBARBUS. Humbly, sir, I thank you.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. Rome. A Room in Caesar’s House.   Enter Antony, Caesar, Octavia between them.  ANTONY. The world and my great office will sometimes Divide me from your bosom.  OCTAVIA. All which time Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers To them for you.  ANTONY. Good night, sir.—My Octavia, Read not my blemishes in the world’s report. I have not kept my square, but that to come Shall all be done by th’ rule. Good night, dear lady.  OCTAVIA. Good night, sir.  CAESAR. Good night.   [_Exeunt Caesar and Octavia._]   Enter Soothsayer.  ANTONY. Now, sirrah, you do wish yourself in Egypt?  SOOTHSAYER. Would I had never come from thence, nor you thither!  ANTONY. If you can, your reason.  SOOTHSAYER. I see it in my motion, have it not in my tongue. But yet hie you to Egypt again.  ANTONY. Say to me, Whose fortunes shall rise higher, Caesar’s or mine?  SOOTHSAYER. Caesar’s. Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side. Thy dæmon—that thy spirit which keeps thee—is Noble, courageous, high, unmatchable, Where Caesar’s is not. But near him, thy angel Becomes afeard, as being o’erpowered. Therefore Make space enough between you.  ANTONY. Speak this no more.  SOOTHSAYER. To none but thee; no more but when to thee. If thou dost play with him at any game, Thou art sure to lose; and of that natural luck He beats thee ’gainst the odds. Thy lustre thickens When he shines by. I say again, thy spirit Is all afraid to govern thee near him; But, he away, ’tis noble.  ANTONY. Get thee gone. Say to Ventidius I would speak with him.   [_Exit Soothsayer._]  He shall to Parthia. Be it art or hap, He hath spoken true. The very dice obey him, And in our sports my better cunning faints Under his chance. If we draw lots, he speeds; His cocks do win the battle still of mine When it is all to naught, and his quails ever Beat mine, inhooped, at odds. I will to Egypt: And though I make this marriage for my peace, I’ th’ East my pleasure lies.   Enter Ventidius.  O, come, Ventidius, You must to Parthia. Your commission’s ready. Follow me and receive ’t.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IV. Rome. A street.   Enter Lepidus, Maecenas and Agrippa.  LEPIDUS. Trouble yourselves no further. Pray you hasten Your generals after.  AGRIPPA. Sir, Mark Antony Will e’en but kiss Octavia, and we’ll follow.  LEPIDUS. Till I shall see you in your soldier’s dress, Which will become you both, farewell.  MAECENAS. We shall, As I conceive the journey, be at the Mount Before you, Lepidus.  LEPIDUS. Your way is shorter; My purposes do draw me much about. You’ll win two days upon me.  BOTH. Sir, good success!  LEPIDUS. Farewell.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE V. Alexandria. A Room in the Palace.   Enter Cleopatra, Charmian, Iras, Alexas.  CLEOPATRA. Give me some music—music, moody food Of us that trade in love.  ALL. The music, ho!   Enter Mardian, the eunuch.  CLEOPATRA. Let it alone. Let’s to billiards. Come, Charmian.  CHARMIAN. My arm is sore. Best play with Mardian.  CLEOPATRA. As well a woman with an eunuch played As with a woman. Come, you’ll play with me, sir?  MARDIAN. As well as I can, madam.  CLEOPATRA. And when good will is showed, though’t come too short, The actor may plead pardon. I’ll none now. Give me mine angle; we’ll to the river. There, My music playing far off, I will betray Tawny-finned fishes. My bended hook shall pierce Their slimy jaws, and as I draw them up I’ll think them every one an Antony, And say “Ah, ha! You’re caught.”  CHARMIAN. ’Twas merry when You wagered on your angling; when your diver Did hang a salt fish on his hook, which he With fervency drew up.  CLEOPATRA. That time?—O times!— I laughed him out of patience; and that night I laughed him into patience, and next morn, Ere the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed, Then put my tires and mantles on him, whilst I wore his sword Philippan.   Enter Messenger.  O! from Italy! Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears, That long time have been barren.  MESSENGER. Madam, madam—  CLEOPATRA. Antony’s dead! If thou say so, villain, Thou kill’st thy mistress. But well and free, If thou so yield him, there is gold, and here My bluest veins to kiss, a hand that kings Have lipped, and trembled kissing.  MESSENGER. First, madam, he’s well.  CLEOPATRA. Why, there’s more gold. But sirrah, mark, we use To say the dead are well. Bring it to that, The gold I give thee will I melt and pour Down thy ill-uttering throat.  MESSENGER. Good madam, hear me.  CLEOPATRA. Well, go to, I will. But there’s no goodness in thy face if Antony Be free and healthful. So tart a favour To trumpet such good tidings! If not well, Thou shouldst come like a Fury crowned with snakes, Not like a formal man.  MESSENGER. Will’t please you hear me?  CLEOPATRA. I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak’st. Yet if thou say Antony lives, is well, Or friends with Caesar, or not captive to him, I’ll set thee in a shower of gold and hail Rich pearls upon thee.  MESSENGER. Madam, he’s well.  CLEOPATRA. Well said.  MESSENGER. And friends with Caesar.  CLEOPATRA. Th’ art an honest man.  MESSENGER. Caesar and he are greater friends than ever.  CLEOPATRA. Make thee a fortune from me.  MESSENGER. But yet, madam—  CLEOPATRA. I do not like “But yet”, it does allay The good precedence. Fie upon “But yet”! “But yet” is as a gaoler to bring forth Some monstrous malefactor. Prithee, friend, Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear, The good and bad together: he’s friends with Caesar, In state of health, thou say’st; and, thou say’st, free.  MESSENGER. Free, madam? No. I made no such report. He’s bound unto Octavia.  CLEOPATRA. For what good turn?  MESSENGER. For the best turn i’ th’ bed.  CLEOPATRA. I am pale, Charmian.  MESSENGER. Madam, he’s married to Octavia.  CLEOPATRA. The most infectious pestilence upon thee!   [_Strikes him down._]  MESSENGER. Good madam, patience.  CLEOPATRA. What say you?   [_Strikes him again._]  Hence, horrible villain, or I’ll spurn thine eyes Like balls before me! I’ll unhair thy head!   [_She hales him up and down._]  Thou shalt be whipped with wire and stewed in brine, Smarting in ling’ring pickle.  MESSENGER. Gracious madam, I that do bring the news made not the match.  CLEOPATRA. Say ’tis not so, a province I will give thee, And make thy fortunes proud. The blow thou hadst Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage, And I will boot thee with what gift beside Thy modesty can beg.  MESSENGER. He’s married, madam.  CLEOPATRA. Rogue, thou hast lived too long.   [_Draws a knife._]  MESSENGER. Nay then I’ll run. What mean you, madam? I have made no fault.   [_Exit._]  CHARMIAN. Good madam, keep yourself within yourself. The man is innocent.  CLEOPATRA. Some innocents ’scape not the thunderbolt. Melt Egypt into Nile, and kindly creatures Turn all to serpents! Call the slave again. Though I am mad, I will not bite him. Call!  CHARMIAN. He is afeard to come.  CLEOPATRA. I will not hurt him.   [_Exit Charmian._]  These hands do lack nobility that they strike A meaner than myself, since I myself Have given myself the cause.   Enter the Messenger again with Charmian.  Come hither, sir. Though it be honest, it is never good To bring bad news. Give to a gracious message An host of tongues, but let ill tidings tell Themselves when they be felt.  MESSENGER. I have done my duty.  CLEOPATRA. Is he married? I cannot hate thee worser than I do If thou again say “Yes.”  MESSENGER. He’s married, madam.  CLEOPATRA. The gods confound thee! Dost thou hold there still!  MESSENGER. Should I lie, madam?  CLEOPATRA. O, I would thou didst, So half my Egypt were submerged and made A cistern for scaled snakes! Go, get thee hence. Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face, to me Thou wouldst appear most ugly. He is married?  MESSENGER. I crave your highness’ pardon.  CLEOPATRA. He is married?  MESSENGER. Take no offence that I would not offend you. To punish me for what you make me do Seems much unequal. He’s married to Octavia.  CLEOPATRA. O, that his fault should make a knave of thee That art not what thou’rt sure of! Get thee hence! The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome Are all too dear for me. Lie they upon thy hand, And be undone by ’em!   [_Exit Messenger._]  CHARMIAN. Good your highness, patience.  CLEOPATRA. In praising Antony I have dispraised Caesar.  CHARMIAN. Many times, madam.  CLEOPATRA. I am paid for’t now. Lead me from hence; I faint. O Iras, Charmian! ’Tis no matter. Go to the fellow, good Alexas, bid him Report the feature of Octavia, her years, Her inclination; let him not leave out The colour of her hair. Bring me word quickly.   [_Exit Alexas._]  Let him for ever go—let him not, Charmian. Though he be painted one way like a Gorgon, The other way ’s a Mars. [_To Mardian_] Bid you Alexas Bring me word how tall she is. Pity me, Charmian, But do not speak to me. Lead me to my chamber.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE VI. Near Misenum.   Flourish. Enter Pompey and Menas at one door, with drum and trumpet;  at another, Caesar, Lepidus, Antony, Enobarbus, Maecenas, Agrippa,  with Soldiers marching.  POMPEY. Your hostages I have, so have you mine, And we shall talk before we fight.  CAESAR. Most meet That first we come to words, and therefore have we Our written purposes before us sent, Which if thou hast considered, let us know If ’twill tie up thy discontented sword And carry back to Sicily much tall youth That else must perish here.  POMPEY. To you all three, The senators alone of this great world, Chief factors for the gods: I do not know Wherefore my father should revengers want, Having a son and friends, since Julius Caesar, Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted, There saw you labouring for him. What was’t That moved pale Cassius to conspire? And what Made the all-honoured, honest Roman, Brutus, With the armed rest, courtiers of beauteous freedom, To drench the Capitol, but that they would Have one man but a man? And that is it Hath made me rig my navy, at whose burden The angered ocean foams, with which I meant To scourge th’ ingratitude that despiteful Rome Cast on my noble father.  CAESAR. Take your time.  ANTONY. Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails. We’ll speak with thee at sea. At land thou know’st How much we do o’ercount thee.  POMPEY. At land indeed Thou dost o’ercount me of my father’s house; But since the cuckoo builds not for himself, Remain in’t as thou mayst.  LEPIDUS. Be pleased to tell us— For this is from the present—how you take The offers we have sent you.  CAESAR. There’s the point.  ANTONY. Which do not be entreated to, but weigh What it is worth embraced.  CAESAR. And what may follow To try a larger fortune.  POMPEY. You have made me offer Of Sicily, Sardinia; and I must Rid all the sea of pirates; then to send Measures of wheat to Rome. This ’greed upon, To part with unhacked edges and bear back Our targes undinted.  CAESAR, ANTONY, and LEPIDUS. That’s our offer.  POMPEY. Know, then, I came before you here a man prepared To take this offer. But Mark Antony Put me to some impatience. Though I lose The praise of it by telling, you must know When Caesar and your brother were at blows, Your mother came to Sicily and did find Her welcome friendly.  ANTONY. I have heard it, Pompey, And am well studied for a liberal thanks Which I do owe you.  POMPEY. Let me have your hand. I did not think, sir, to have met you here.  ANTONY. The beds i’ th’ East are soft; and thanks to you, That called me timelier than my purpose hither, For I have gained by ’t.  CAESAR. Since I saw you last, There is a change upon you.  POMPEY. Well, I know not What counts harsh Fortune casts upon my face, But in my bosom shall she never come To make my heart her vassal.  LEPIDUS. Well met here.  POMPEY. I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed. I crave our composition may be written And sealed between us.  CAESAR. That’s the next to do.  POMPEY. We’ll feast each other ere we part, and let’s Draw lots who shall begin.  ANTONY. That will I, Pompey.  POMPEY. No, Antony, take the lot. But, first or last, your fine Egyptian cookery Shall have the fame. I have heard that Julius Caesar Grew fat with feasting there.  ANTONY. You have heard much.  POMPEY. I have fair meanings, sir.  ANTONY. And fair words to them.  POMPEY. Then so much have I heard. And I have heard Apollodorus carried—  ENOBARBUS. No more of that. He did so.  POMPEY. What, I pray you?  ENOBARBUS. A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.  POMPEY. I know thee now. How far’st thou, soldier?  ENOBARBUS. Well; And well am like to do, for I perceive Four feasts are toward.  POMPEY. Let me shake thy hand. I never hated thee. I have seen thee fight When I have envied thy behaviour.  ENOBARBUS. Sir, I never loved you much, but I ha’ praised ye When you have well deserved ten times as much As I have said you did.  POMPEY. Enjoy thy plainness; It nothing ill becomes thee. Aboard my galley I invite you all. Will you lead, lords?  CAESAR, ANTONY, and LEPIDUS. Show’s the way, sir.  POMPEY. Come.   [_Exeunt all but Enobarbus and Menas._]  MENAS. [_Aside_.] Thy father, Pompey, would ne’er have made this treaty.— You and I have known, sir.  ENOBARBUS. At sea, I think.  MENAS. We have, sir.  ENOBARBUS. You have done well by water.  MENAS. And you by land.  ENOBARBUS. I will praise any man that will praise me, though it cannot be denied what I have done by land.  MENAS. Nor what I have done by water.  ENOBARBUS. Yes, something you can deny for your own safety: you have been a great thief by sea.  MENAS. And you by land.  ENOBARBUS. There I deny my land service. But give me your hand, Menas. If our eyes had authority, here they might take two thieves kissing.  MENAS. All men’s faces are true, whatsome’er their hands are.  ENOBARBUS. But there is never a fair woman has a true face.  MENAS. No slander. They steal hearts.  ENOBARBUS. We came hither to fight with you.  MENAS. For my part, I am sorry it is turned to a drinking. Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.  ENOBARBUS. If he do, sure he cannot weep ’t back again.  MENAS. You have said, sir. We looked not for Mark Antony here. Pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?  ENOBARBUS. Caesar’s sister is called Octavia.  MENAS. True, sir. She was the wife of Caius Marcellus.  ENOBARBUS. But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.  MENAS. Pray you, sir?  ENOBARBUS. ’Tis true.  MENAS. Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.  ENOBARBUS. If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would not prophesy so.  MENAS. I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties.  ENOBARBUS. I think so too. But you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity. Octavia is of a holy, cold, and still conversation.  MENAS. Who would not have his wife so?  ENOBARBUS. Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony. He will to his Egyptian dish again. Then shall the sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar, and, as I said before, that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance. Antony will use his affection where it is. He married but his occasion here.  MENAS. And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard? I have a health for you.  ENOBARBUS. I shall take it, sir. We have used our throats in Egypt.  MENAS. Come, let’s away.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE VII. On board Pompey’s Galley, lying near Misenum.   Music. Enter two or three Servants with a banquet.  FIRST SERVANT. Here they’ll be, man. Some o’ their plants are ill-rooted already; the least wind i’ th’ world will blow them down.  SECOND SERVANT. Lepidus is high-coloured.  FIRST SERVANT. They have made him drink alms-drink.  SECOND SERVANT. As they pinch one another by the disposition, he cries out “no more”, reconciles them to his entreaty and himself to th’ drink.  FIRST SERVANT. But it raises the greater war between him and his discretion.  SECOND SERVANT. Why, this it is to have a name in great men’s fellowship. I had as lief have a reed that will do me no service as a partisan I could not heave.  FIRST SERVANT. To be called into a huge sphere, and not to be seen to move in ’t, are the holes where eyes should be, which pitifully disaster the cheeks.   A sennet sounded. Enter Caesar, Antony, Pompey, Lepidus, Agrippa,  Maecenas, Enobarbus, Menas with other Captains.  ANTONY. [_To Caesar_.] Thus do they, sir: they take the flow o’ th’ Nile By certain scales i’ th’ pyramid; they know By th’ height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth Or foison follow. The higher Nilus swells, The more it promises. As it ebbs, the seedsman Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain, And shortly comes to harvest.  LEPIDUS. You’ve strange serpents there?  ANTONY. Ay, Lepidus.  LEPIDUS. Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the operation of your sun; so is your crocodile.  ANTONY. They are so.  POMPEY. Sit, and some wine! A health to Lepidus!  LEPIDUS. I am not so well as I should be, but I’ll ne’er out.  ENOBARBUS. Not till you have slept. I fear me you’ll be in till then.  LEPIDUS. Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies’ pyramises are very goodly things. Without contradiction I have heard that.  MENAS. [_Aside to Pompey_.] Pompey, a word.  POMPEY. [_Aside to Menas_.] Say in mine ear what is ’t?  MENAS. [_Whispers in ’s ear._] Forsake thy seat, I do beseech thee, captain, And hear me speak a word.  POMPEY. [_Aside to Menas._] Forbear me till anon.— This wine for Lepidus!  LEPIDUS. What manner o’ thing is your crocodile?  ANTONY. It is shaped, sir, like itself, and it is as broad as it hath breadth. It is just so high as it is, and moves with it own organs. It lives by that which nourisheth it, and the elements once out of it, it transmigrates.  LEPIDUS. What colour is it of?  ANTONY. Of its own colour too.  LEPIDUS. ’Tis a strange serpent.  ANTONY. ’Tis so, and the tears of it are wet.  CAESAR. Will this description satisfy him?  ANTONY. With the health that Pompey gives him, else he is a very epicure.  POMPEY. [_Aside to Menas._] Go hang, sir, hang! Tell me of that? Away! Do as I bid you.—Where’s this cup I called for?  MENAS. [_Aside to Pompey_.] If for the sake of merit thou wilt hear me, Rise from thy stool.  POMPEY. [_Aside to Menas_.] I think thou’rt mad.   [_Rises and walks aside._]  The matter?  MENAS. I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.  POMPEY. Thou hast served me with much faith. What’s else to say?— Be jolly, lords.  ANTONY. These quicksands, Lepidus, Keep off them, for you sink.  MENAS. Wilt thou be lord of all the world?  POMPEY. What sayst thou?  MENAS. Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That’s twice.  POMPEY. How should that be?  MENAS. But entertain it, And though you think me poor, I am the man Will give thee all the world.  POMPEY. Hast thou drunk well?  MENAS. No, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup. Thou art, if thou dar’st be, the earthly Jove. Whate’er the ocean pales or sky inclips Is thine, if thou wilt have’t.  POMPEY. Show me which way.  MENAS. These three world-sharers, these competitors, Are in thy vessel. Let me cut the cable, And when we are put off, fall to their throats. All then is thine.  POMPEY. Ah, this thou shouldst have done And not have spoke on ’t! In me ’tis villainy; In thee ’t had been good service. Thou must know ’Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour; Mine honour it. Repent that e’er thy tongue Hath so betray’d thine act. Being done unknown, I should have found it afterwards well done, But must condemn it now. Desist, and drink.  MENAS. [_Aside_.] For this, I’ll never follow thy palled fortunes more. Who seeks, and will not take when once ’tis offered, Shall never find it more.  POMPEY. This health to Lepidus!  ANTONY. Bear him ashore. I’ll pledge it for him, Pompey.  ENOBARBUS. Here’s to thee, Menas!  MENAS. Enobarbus, welcome!  POMPEY. Fill till the cup be hid.  ENOBARBUS. There’s a strong fellow, Menas.   [_Pointing to the servant who carries off Lepidus._]  MENAS. Why?  ENOBARBUS. ’A bears the third part of the world, man. Seest not?  MENAS. The third part, then, is drunk. Would it were all, That it might go on wheels!  ENOBARBUS. Drink thou. Increase the reels.  MENAS. Come.  POMPEY. This is not yet an Alexandrian feast.  ANTONY. It ripens towards it. Strike the vessels, ho! Here is to Caesar!  CAESAR. I could well forbear’t. It’s monstrous labour when I wash my brain And it grows fouler.  ANTONY. Be a child o’ the time.  CAESAR. Possess it, I’ll make answer. But I had rather fast from all, four days, Than drink so much in one.  ENOBARBUS. [_To Antony_.] Ha, my brave emperor, Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals And celebrate our drink?  POMPEY. Let’s ha’t, good soldier.  ANTONY. Come, let’s all take hands Till that the conquering wine hath steeped our sense In soft and delicate Lethe.  ENOBARBUS. All take hands. Make battery to our ears with the loud music, The while I’ll place you; then the boy shall sing. The holding every man shall beat as loud As his strong sides can volley.   Music plays. Enobarbus places them hand in hand.         THE SONG.   Come, thou monarch of the vine,   Plumpy Bacchus with pink eyne!   In thy vats our cares be drowned,   With thy grapes our hairs be crowned.   Cup us till the world go round,   Cup us till the world go round!  CAESAR. What would you more? Pompey, good night. Good brother, Let me request you off. Our graver business Frowns at this levity.—Gentle lords, let’s part. You see we have burnt our cheeks. Strong Enobarb Is weaker than the wine, and mine own tongue Splits what it speaks. The wild disguise hath almost Anticked us all. What needs more words. Good night. Good Antony, your hand.  POMPEY. I’ll try you on the shore.  ANTONY. And shall, sir. Give’s your hand.  POMPEY. O Antony, You have my father’s house. But, what? We are friends. Come, down into the boat.  ENOBARBUS. Take heed you fall not.   [_Exeunt Pompey, Caesar, Antony and Attendants._]  Menas, I’ll not on shore.  MENAS. No, to my cabin. These drums, these trumpets, flutes! What! Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell To these great fellows. Sound and be hanged, sound out!   [_Sound a flourish with drums._]  ENOBARBUS. Hoo, says ’a! There’s my cap!  MENAS. Hoo! Noble captain, come.   [_Exeunt._]
  ACT III
SCENE I. A plain in Syria.   Enter Ventidius as it were in triumph, with Silius and other Romans,  Officers and Soldiers; the dead body of Pacorus borne before him.  VENTIDIUS. Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck, and now Pleased Fortune does of Marcus Crassus’ death Make me revenger. Bear the king’s son’s body Before our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes, Pays this for Marcus Crassus.  SILIUS. Noble Ventidius, Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm, The fugitive Parthians follow. Spur through Media, Mesopotamia, and the shelters whither The routed fly. So thy grand captain Antony Shall set thee on triumphant chariots, and Put garlands on thy head.  VENTIDIUS. O Silius, Silius, I have done enough. A lower place, note well, May make too great an act. For learn this, Silius: Better to leave undone than by our deed Acquire too high a fame when him we serve’s away. Caesar and Antony have ever won More in their officer, than person. Sossius, One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant, For quick accumulation of renown, Which he achieved by th’ minute, lost his favour. Who does i’ th’ wars more than his captain can Becomes his captain’s captain; and ambition, The soldier’s virtue, rather makes choice of loss Than gain which darkens him. I could do more to do Antonius good, But ’twould offend him, and in his offence Should my performance perish.  SILIUS. Thou hast, Ventidius, that Without the which a soldier and his sword Grants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to Antony?  VENTIDIUS. I’ll humbly signify what in his name, That magical word of war, we have effected; How, with his banners, and his well-paid ranks, The ne’er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia We have jaded out o’ th’ field.  SILIUS. Where is he now?  VENTIDIUS. He purposeth to Athens, whither, with what haste The weight we must convey with ’s will permit, We shall appear before him.—On there, pass along!   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. Rome. An Ante-chamber in Caesar’s house.   Enter Agrippa at one door, Enobarbus at another.  AGRIPPA. What, are the brothers parted?  ENOBARBUS. They have dispatched with Pompey; he is gone. The other three are sealing. Octavia weeps To part from Rome. Caesar is sad, and Lepidus, Since Pompey’s feast, as Menas says, is troubled With the greensickness.  AGRIPPA. ’Tis a noble Lepidus.  ENOBARBUS. A very fine one. O, how he loves Caesar!  AGRIPPA. Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!  ENOBARBUS. Caesar? Why he’s the Jupiter of men.  AGRIPPA. What’s Antony? The god of Jupiter.  ENOBARBUS. Spake you of Caesar? How, the nonpareil!  AGRIPPA. O, Antony! O thou Arabian bird!  ENOBARBUS. Would you praise Caesar, say “Caesar”. Go no further.  AGRIPPA. Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.  ENOBARBUS. But he loves Caesar best, yet he loves Antony. Hoo! Hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards, poets, cannot Think, speak, cast, write, sing, number—hoo!— His love to Antony. But as for Caesar, Kneel down, kneel down, and wonder.  AGRIPPA. Both he loves.  ENOBARBUS. They are his shards, and he their beetle.   [_Trumpets within._]  So, This is to horse. Adieu, noble Agrippa.  AGRIPPA. Good fortune, worthy soldier, and farewell.   Enter Caesar, Antony, Lepidus and Octavia.  ANTONY. No further, sir.  CAESAR. You take from me a great part of myself. Use me well in’t. Sister, prove such a wife As my thoughts make thee, and as my farthest bond Shall pass on thy approof. Most noble Antony, Let not the piece of virtue which is set Betwixt us, as the cement of our love To keep it builded, be the ram to batter The fortress of it. For better might we Have loved without this mean, if on both parts This be not cherished.  ANTONY. Make me not offended In your distrust.  CAESAR. I have said.  ANTONY. You shall not find, Though you be therein curious, the least cause For what you seem to fear. So the gods keep you, And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends. We will here part.  CAESAR. Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well. The elements be kind to thee, and make Thy spirits all of comfort! Fare thee well.  OCTAVIA. My noble brother!  ANTONY. The April’s in her eyes. It is love’s spring, And these the showers to bring it on.—Be cheerful.  OCTAVIA. Sir, look well to my husband’s house, and—  CAESAR. What, Octavia?  OCTAVIA. I’ll tell you in your ear.  ANTONY. Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor can Her heart inform her tongue—the swan’s-down feather, That stands upon the swell at the full of tide, And neither way inclines.  ENOBARBUS. [_Aside to Agrippa_.] Will Caesar weep?  AGRIPPA. [_Aside to Enobarbus_.] He has a cloud in ’s face.  ENOBARBUS. [_Aside to Agrippa_.] He were the worse for that were he a horse; So is he, being a man.  AGRIPPA. [_Aside to Enobarbus_.] Why, Enobarbus, When Antony found Julius Caesar dead, He cried almost to roaring, and he wept When at Philippi he found Brutus slain.  ENOBARBUS. [_Aside to Agrippa_.] That year, indeed, he was troubled with a rheum; What willingly he did confound he wailed, Believe ’t, till I weep too.  CAESAR. No, sweet Octavia, You shall hear from me still. The time shall not Outgo my thinking on you.  ANTONY. Come, sir, come, I’ll wrestle with you in my strength of love. Look, here I have you, thus I let you go, And give you to the gods.  CAESAR. Adieu, be happy!  LEPIDUS. Let all the number of the stars give light To thy fair way!  CAESAR. Farewell, farewell!   [_Kisses Octavia._]  ANTONY. Farewell!   [_Trumpets sound. Exeunt._]  SCENE III. Alexandria. A Room in the Palace.   Enter Cleopatra, Charmian, Iras and Alexas.  CLEOPATRA. Where is the fellow?  ALEXAS. Half afeared to come.  CLEOPATRA. Go to, go to.   Enter a Messenger as before.  Come hither, sir.  ALEXAS. Good majesty, Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you But when you are well pleased.  CLEOPATRA. That Herod’s head I’ll have! But how, when Antony is gone, Through whom I might command it?—Come thou near.  MESSENGER. Most gracious majesty!  CLEOPATRA. Didst thou behold Octavia?  MESSENGER. Ay, dread queen.  CLEOPATRA. Where?  MESSENGER. Madam, in Rome I looked her in the face, and saw her led Between her brother and Mark Antony.  CLEOPATRA. Is she as tall as me?  MESSENGER. She is not, madam.  CLEOPATRA. Didst hear her speak? Is she shrill-tongued or low?  MESSENGER. Madam, I heard her speak. She is low-voiced.  CLEOPATRA. That’s not so good. He cannot like her long.  CHARMIAN. Like her? O Isis! ’Tis impossible.  CLEOPATRA. I think so, Charmian: dull of tongue and dwarfish! What majesty is in her gait? Remember, If e’er thou look’dst on majesty.  MESSENGER. She creeps. Her motion and her station are as one. She shows a body rather than a life, A statue than a breather.  CLEOPATRA. Is this certain?  MESSENGER. Or I have no observance.  CHARMIAN. Three in Egypt Cannot make better note.  CLEOPATRA. He’s very knowing; I do perceive’t. There’s nothing in her yet. The fellow has good judgment.  CHARMIAN. Excellent.  CLEOPATRA. Guess at her years, I prithee.  MESSENGER. Madam, She was a widow.  CLEOPATRA. Widow! Charmian, hark!  MESSENGER. And I do think she’s thirty.  CLEOPATRA. Bear’st thou her face in mind? Is’t long or round?  MESSENGER. Round even to faultiness.  CLEOPATRA. For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so. Her hair, what colour?  MESSENGER. Brown, madam, and her forehead As low as she would wish it.  CLEOPATRA. There’s gold for thee. Thou must not take my former sharpness ill. I will employ thee back again; I find thee Most fit for business. Go make thee ready; Our letters are prepared.   [_Exit Messenger._]  CHARMIAN. A proper man.  CLEOPATRA. Indeed, he is so. I repent me much That so I harried him. Why, methinks, by him, This creature’s no such thing.  CHARMIAN. Nothing, madam.  CLEOPATRA. The man hath seen some majesty, and should know.  CHARMIAN. Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend, And serving you so long!  CLEOPATRA. I have one thing more to ask him yet, good Charmian. But ’tis no matter; thou shalt bring him to me Where I will write. All may be well enough.  CHARMIAN. I warrant you, madam.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IV. Athens. A Room in Antony’s House.   Enter Antony and Octavia.  ANTONY. Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that— That were excusable, that and thousands more Of semblable import—but he hath waged New wars ’gainst Pompey; made his will, and read it To public ear; Spoke scantly of me; when perforce he could not But pay me terms of honour, cold and sickly He vented them; most narrow measure lent me; When the best hint was given him, he not took ’t, Or did it from his teeth.  OCTAVIA. O, my good lord, Believe not all, or if you must believe, Stomach not all. A more unhappy lady, If this division chance, ne’er stood between, Praying for both parts. The good gods will mock me presently When I shall pray “O, bless my lord and husband!” Undo that prayer by crying out as loud “O, bless my brother!” Husband win, win brother, Prays and destroys the prayer; no midway ’Twixt these extremes at all.  ANTONY. Gentle Octavia, Let your best love draw to that point which seeks Best to preserve it. If I lose mine honour, I lose myself; better I were not yours Than yours so branchless. But, as you requested, Yourself shall go between’s. The meantime, lady, I’ll raise the preparation of a war Shall stain your brother. Make your soonest haste, So your desires are yours.  OCTAVIA. Thanks to my lord. The Jove of power make me, most weak, most weak, Your reconciler! Wars ’twixt you twain would be As if the world should cleave, and that slain men Should solder up the rift.  ANTONY. When it appears to you where this begins, Turn your displeasure that way, for our faults Can never be so equal that your love Can equally move with them. Provide your going; Choose your own company, and command what cost Your heart has mind to.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE V. Athens. Another Room in Antony’s House.   Enter Enobarbus and Eros meeting.  ENOBARBUS. How now, friend Eros?  EROS. There’s strange news come, sir.  ENOBARBUS. What, man?  EROS. Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.  ENOBARBUS. This is old. What is the success?  EROS. Caesar, having made use of him in the wars ’gainst Pompey, presently denied him rivality; would not let him partake in the glory of the action, and, not resting here, accuses him of letters he had formerly wrote to Pompey; upon his own appeal, seizes him. So the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine.  ENOBARBUS. Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps, no more, And throw between them all the food thou hast, They’ll grind the one the other. Where’s Antony?  EROS. He’s walking in the garden, thus, and spurns The rush that lies before him; cries “Fool Lepidus!” And threats the throat of that his officer That murdered Pompey.  ENOBARBUS. Our great navy’s rigged.  EROS. For Italy and Caesar. More, Domitius: My lord desires you presently. My news I might have told hereafter.  ENOBARBUS. ’Twill be naught, But let it be. Bring me to Antony.  EROS. Come, sir.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE VI. Rome. A Room in Caesar’s House.   Enter Agrippa, Maecenas and Caesar.  CAESAR. Contemning Rome, he has done all this, and more In Alexandria. Here’s the manner of ’t: I’ th’ market-place, on a tribunal silvered, Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold Were publicly enthroned. At the feet sat Caesarion, whom they call my father’s son, And all the unlawful issue that their lust Since then hath made between them. Unto her He gave the stablishment of Egypt; made her Of lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia, Absolute queen.  MAECENAS. This in the public eye?  CAESAR. I’ th’ common showplace where they exercise. His sons he there proclaimed the kings of kings: Great Media, Parthia, and Armenia He gave to Alexander; to Ptolemy he assigned Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia. She In th’ habiliments of the goddess Isis That day appeared, and oft before gave audience, As ’tis reported, so.  MAECENAS. Let Rome be thus informed.  AGRIPPA. Who, queasy with his insolence already, Will their good thoughts call from him.  CAESAR. The people knows it and have now received His accusations.  AGRIPPA. Who does he accuse?  CAESAR. Caesar, and that, having in Sicily Sextus Pompeius spoiled, we had not rated him His part o’ th’ isle. Then does he say he lent me Some shipping, unrestored. Lastly, he frets That Lepidus of the triumvirate Should be deposed and, being, that we detain All his revenue.  AGRIPPA. Sir, this should be answered.  CAESAR. ’Tis done already, and messenger gone. I have told him Lepidus was grown too cruel, That he his high authority abused, And did deserve his change. For what I have conquered I grant him part; but then in his Armenia And other of his conquered kingdoms, I Demand the like.  MAECENAS. He’ll never yield to that.  CAESAR. Nor must not then be yielded to in this.   Enter Octavia with her train.  OCTAVIA. Hail, Caesar, and my lord! Hail, most dear Caesar!  CAESAR. That ever I should call thee castaway!  OCTAVIA. You have not called me so, nor have you cause.  CAESAR. Why have you stolen upon us thus? You come not Like Caesar’s sister. The wife of Antony Should have an army for an usher, and The neighs of horse to tell of her approach Long ere she did appear. The trees by th’ way Should have borne men, and expectation fainted, Longing for what it had not. Nay, the dust Should have ascended to the roof of heaven, Raised by your populous troops. But you are come A market-maid to Rome, and have prevented The ostentation of our love, which, left unshown, Is often left unloved. We should have met you By sea and land, supplying every stage With an augmented greeting.  OCTAVIA. Good my lord, To come thus was I not constrained, but did it On my free will. My lord, Mark Antony, Hearing that you prepared for war, acquainted My grieved ear withal, whereon I begged His pardon for return.  CAESAR. Which soon he granted, Being an abstract ’tween his lust and him.  OCTAVIA. Do not say so, my lord.  CAESAR. I have eyes upon him, And his affairs come to me on the wind. Where is he now?  OCTAVIA. My lord, in Athens.  CAESAR. No, my most wronged sister. Cleopatra Hath nodded him to her. He hath given his empire Up to a whore, who now are levying The kings o’ th’ earth for war. He hath assembled Bocchus, the king of Libya; Archelaus Of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, king Of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas; King Manchus of Arabia; King of Pont; Herod of Jewry; Mithridates, king Of Comagene; Polemon and Amyntas, The kings of Mede and Lycaonia, With a more larger list of sceptres.  OCTAVIA. Ay me, most wretched, That have my heart parted betwixt two friends That does afflict each other!  CAESAR. Welcome hither. Your letters did withhold our breaking forth Till we perceived both how you were wrong led And we in negligent danger. Cheer your heart. Be you not troubled with the time, which drives O’er your content these strong necessities, But let determined things to destiny Hold unbewailed their way. Welcome to Rome, Nothing more dear to me. You are abused Beyond the mark of thought, and the high gods, To do you justice, make their ministers Of us and those that love you. Best of comfort, And ever welcome to us.  AGRIPPA. Welcome, lady.  MAECENAS. Welcome, dear madam. Each heart in Rome does love and pity you. Only th’ adulterous Antony, most large In his abominations, turns you off And gives his potent regiment to a trull That noises it against us.  OCTAVIA. Is it so, sir?  CAESAR. Most certain. Sister, welcome. Pray you Be ever known to patience. My dear’st sister!   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE VII. Antony’s Camp near the Promontory of Actium.   Enter Cleopatra and Enobarbus.  CLEOPATRA. I will be even with thee, doubt it not.  ENOBARBUS. But why, why, why?  CLEOPATRA. Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars And say’st it is not fit.  ENOBARBUS. Well, is it, is it?  CLEOPATRA. Is ’t not denounced against us? Why should not we Be there in person?  ENOBARBUS. Well, I could reply: If we should serve with horse and mares together, The horse were merely lost. The mares would bear A soldier and his horse.  CLEOPATRA. What is’t you say?  ENOBARBUS. Your presence needs must puzzle Antony, Take from his heart, take from his brain, from ’s time, What should not then be spared. He is already Traduced for levity, and ’tis said in Rome That Photinus, an eunuch, and your maids Manage this war.  CLEOPATRA. Sink Rome, and their tongues rot That speak against us! A charge we bear i’ th’ war, And, as the president of my kingdom, will Appear there for a man. Speak not against it. I will not stay behind.   Enter Antony and Canidius.  ENOBARBUS. Nay, I have done. Here comes the Emperor.  ANTONY. Is it not strange, Canidius, That from Tarentum and Brundusium He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea And take in Toryne?—You have heard on ’t, sweet?  CLEOPATRA. Celerity is never more admired Than by the negligent.  ANTONY. A good rebuke, Which might have well becomed the best of men To taunt at slackness.—Canidius, we Will fight with him by sea.  CLEOPATRA. By sea, what else?  CANIDIUS. Why will my lord do so?  ANTONY. For that he dares us to ’t.  ENOBARBUS. So hath my lord dared him to single fight.  CANIDIUS. Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia, Where Caesar fought with Pompey. But these offers, Which serve not for his vantage, he shakes off, And so should you.  ENOBARBUS. Your ships are not well manned, Your mariners are muleteers, reapers, people Engrossed by swift impress. In Caesar’s fleet Are those that often have ’gainst Pompey fought. Their ships are yare, yours heavy. No disgrace Shall fall you for refusing him at sea, Being prepared for land.  ANTONY. By sea, by sea.  ENOBARBUS. Most worthy sir, you therein throw away The absolute soldiership you have by land; Distract your army, which doth most consist Of war-marked footmen; leave unexecuted Your own renowned knowledge; quite forgo The way which promises assurance; and Give up yourself merely to chance and hazard From firm security.  ANTONY. I’ll fight at sea.  CLEOPATRA. I have sixty sails, Caesar none better.  ANTONY. Our overplus of shipping will we burn, And with the rest full-manned, from th’ head of Actium Beat th’ approaching Caesar. But if we fail, We then can do ’t at land.   Enter a Messenger.  Thy business?  MESSENGER. The news is true, my lord; he is descried. Caesar has taken Toryne.  ANTONY. Can he be there in person? ’Tis impossible; Strange that his power should be. Canidius, Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land, And our twelve thousand horse. We’ll to our ship. Away, my Thetis!   Enter a Soldier.  How now, worthy soldier?  SOLDIER. O noble emperor, do not fight by sea. Trust not to rotten planks. Do you misdoubt This sword and these my wounds? Let th’ Egyptians And the Phoenicians go a-ducking. We Have used to conquer standing on the earth And fighting foot to foot.  ANTONY. Well, well, away.   [_Exeunt Antony, Cleopatra and Enobarbus._]  SOLDIER. By Hercules, I think I am i’ th’ right.  CANIDIUS. Soldier, thou art. But his whole action grows Not in the power on ’t. So our leader’s led, And we are women’s men.  SOLDIER. You keep by land The legions and the horse whole, do you not?  CANIDIUS. Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius, Publicola, and Caelius are for sea, But we keep whole by land. This speed of Caesar’s Carries beyond belief.  SOLDIER. While he was yet in Rome, His power went out in such distractions as Beguiled all spies.  CANIDIUS. Who’s his lieutenant, hear you?  SOLDIER. They say one Taurus.  CANIDIUS. Well I know the man.   Enter a Messenger.  MESSENGER. The Emperor calls Canidius.  CANIDIUS. With news the time’s with labour, and throes forth Each minute some.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE VIII. A plain near Actium.   Enter Caesar with his army and Taurus marching.  CAESAR. Taurus!  TAURUS. My lord?  CAESAR. Strike not by land; keep whole; provoke not battle Till we have done at sea. Do not exceed The prescript of this scroll. Our fortune lies Upon this jump.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IX. Another part of the Plain.   Enter Antony and Enobarbus.  ANTONY. Set we our squadrons on yon side o’ th’ hill In eye of Caesar’s battle, from which place We may the number of the ships behold And so proceed accordingly.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE X. Another part of the Plain.  Canidius marching with his land army one way over the stage, and Taurus, the Lieutenant of Caesar, with his Army, the other way. After their going in, is heard the noise of a sea fight.   Alarum. Enter Enobarbus.  ENOBARBUS. Naught, naught, all naught! I can behold no longer. Th’ Antoniad, the Egyptian admiral, With all their sixty, fly and turn the rudder. To see ’t mine eyes are blasted.   Enter Scarus.  SCARUS. Gods and goddesses, All the whole synod of them!  ENOBARBUS. What’s thy passion?  SCARUS. The greater cantle of the world is lost With very ignorance. We have kissed away Kingdoms and provinces.  ENOBARBUS. How appears the fight?  SCARUS. On our side, like the tokened pestilence, Where death is sure. Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt, Whom leprosy o’ertake, i’ th’ midst o’ th’ fight, When vantage like a pair of twins appeared, Both as the same—or, rather, ours the elder— The breeze upon her, like a cow in June, Hoists sails and flies.  ENOBARBUS. That I beheld. Mine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not Endure a further view.  SCARUS. She once being loofed, The noble ruin of her magic, Antony, Claps on his sea-wing and, like a doting mallard, Leaving the fight in height, flies after her. I never saw an action of such shame. Experience, manhood, honour, ne’er before Did violate so itself.  ENOBARBUS. Alack, alack!   Enter Canidius.  CANIDIUS. Our fortune on the sea is out of breath And sinks most lamentably. Had our general Been what he knew himself, it had gone well. O, he has given example for our flight Most grossly by his own!  ENOBARBUS. Ay, are you thereabouts? Why, then, good night indeed.  CANIDIUS. Toward Peloponnesus are they fled.  SCARUS. ’Tis easy to’t, and there I will attend What further comes.  CANIDIUS. To Caesar will I render My legions and my horse. Six kings already Show me the way of yielding.  ENOBARBUS. I’ll yet follow The wounded chance of Antony, though my reason Sits in the wind against me.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE XI. Alexandria. A Room in the Palace.   Enter Antony with attendants.  ANTONY. Hark, the land bids me tread no more upon’t. It is ashamed to bear me. Friends, come hither. I am so lated in the world that I Have lost my way for ever. I have a ship Laden with gold. Take that, divide it. Fly, And make your peace with Caesar.  ALL. Fly? Not we.  ANTONY. I have fled myself, and have instructed cowards To run and show their shoulders. Friends, be gone. I have myself resolved upon a course Which has no need of you. Be gone. My treasure’s in the harbour. Take it. O, I followed that I blush to look upon. My very hairs do mutiny, for the white Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them For fear and doting. Friends, be gone. You shall Have letters from me to some friends that will Sweep your way for you. Pray you, look not sad, Nor make replies of loathness. Take the hint Which my despair proclaims. Let that be left Which leaves itself. To the sea-side straightway. I will possess you of that ship and treasure. Leave me, I pray, a little—pray you, now, Nay, do so; for indeed I have lost command. Therefore I pray you. I’ll see you by and by.   [_Sits down._]   Enter Cleopatra led by Charmian, Iras and Eros.  EROS. Nay, gentle madam, to him! Comfort him.  IRAS. Do, most dear queen.  CHARMIAN. Do! Why, what else?  CLEOPATRA. Let me sit down. O Juno!  ANTONY. No, no, no, no, no.  EROS. See you here, sir?  ANTONY. O, fie, fie, fie!  CHARMIAN. Madam.  IRAS. Madam, O good empress!  EROS. Sir, sir!  ANTONY. Yes, my lord, yes. He at Philippi kept His sword e’en like a dancer, while I struck The lean and wrinkled Cassius, and ’twas I That the mad Brutus ended. He alone Dealt on lieutenantry, and no practice had In the brave squares of war. Yet now—no matter.  CLEOPATRA. Ah, stand by.  EROS. The Queen, my lord, the Queen!  IRAS. Go to him, madam; speak to him. He is unqualitied with very shame.  CLEOPATRA. Well then, sustain me. O!  EROS. Most noble sir, arise. The Queen approaches. Her head’s declined, and death will seize her but Your comfort makes the rescue.  ANTONY. I have offended reputation, A most unnoble swerving.  EROS. Sir, the Queen.  ANTONY. O, whither hast thou led me, Egypt? See How I convey my shame out of thine eyes By looking back what I have left behind ’Stroyed in dishonour.  CLEOPATRA. O my lord, my lord, Forgive my fearful sails! I little thought You would have followed.  ANTONY. Egypt, thou knew’st too well My heart was to thy rudder tied by th’ strings, And thou shouldst tow me after. O’er my spirit Thy full supremacy thou knew’st, and that Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods Command me.  CLEOPATRA. O, my pardon!  ANTONY. Now I must To the young man send humble treaties, dodge And palter in the shifts of lowness, who With half the bulk o’ th’ world played as I pleased, Making and marring fortunes. You did know How much you were my conqueror, and that My sword, made weak by my affection, would Obey it on all cause.  CLEOPATRA. Pardon, pardon!  ANTONY. Fall not a tear, I say; one of them rates All that is won and lost. Give me a kiss. Even this repays me. We sent our schoolmaster. Is he come back? Love, I am full of lead. Some wine Within there, and our viands! Fortune knows We scorn her most when most she offers blows.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE XII. Caesar’s camp in Egypt.   Enter Caesar, Agrippa, Dolabella with others.  CAESAR. Let him appear that’s come from Antony. Know you him?  DOLABELLA. Caesar, ’tis his schoolmaster— An argument that he is plucked, when hither He sends so poor a pinion of his wing, Which had superfluous kings for messengers Not many moons gone by.   Enter Ambassador from Anthony.  CAESAR. Approach, and speak.  AMBASSADOR. Such as I am, I come from Antony. I was of late as petty to his ends As is the morn-dew on the myrtle leaf To his grand sea.  CAESAR. Be’t so. Declare thine office.  AMBASSADOR. Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, and Requires to live in Egypt, which not granted, He lessens his requests, and to thee sues To let him breathe between the heavens and earth, A private man in Athens. This for him. Next, Cleopatra does confess thy greatness, Submits her to thy might, and of thee craves The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs, Now hazarded to thy grace.  CAESAR. For Antony, I have no ears to his request. The queen Of audience nor desire shall fail, so she From Egypt drive her all-disgraced friend, Or take his life there. This if she perform, She shall not sue unheard. So to them both.  AMBASSADOR. Fortune pursue thee!  CAESAR. Bring him through the bands.   [_Exit Ambassador, attended._]  [_To Thidias_.] To try thy eloquence now ’tis time. Dispatch. From Antony win Cleopatra. Promise, And in our name, what she requires; add more, From thine invention, offers. Women are not In their best fortunes strong, but want will perjure The ne’er-touch’d vestal. Try thy cunning, Thidias; Make thine own edict for thy pains, which we Will answer as a law.  THIDIAS. Caesar, I go.  CAESAR. Observe how Antony becomes his flaw, And what thou think’st his very action speaks In every power that moves.  THIDIAS. Caesar, I shall.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE XIII. Alexandria. A Room in the Palace.   Enter Cleopatra, Enobarbus, Charmian and Iras.  CLEOPATRA. What shall we do, Enobarbus?  ENOBARBUS. Think, and die.  CLEOPATRA. Is Antony or we in fault for this?  ENOBARBUS. Antony only, that would make his will Lord of his reason. What though you fled From that great face of war, whose several ranges Frighted each other? Why should he follow? The itch of his affection should not then Have nicked his captainship, at such a point, When half to half the world opposed, he being The mered question. ’Twas a shame no less Than was his loss, to course your flying flags And leave his navy gazing.  CLEOPATRA. Prithee, peace.   Enter the Ambassador with Antony.  ANTONY. Is that his answer?  AMBASSADOR. Ay, my lord.  ANTONY. The Queen shall then have courtesy, so she Will yield us up.  AMBASSADOR. He says so.  ANTONY. Let her know’t.— To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head, And he will fill thy wishes to the brim With principalities.  CLEOPATRA. That head, my lord?  ANTONY. To him again. Tell him he wears the rose Of youth upon him, from which the world should note Something particular: his coin, ships, legions, May be a coward’s; whose ministers would prevail Under the service of a child as soon As i’ th’ command of Caesar. I dare him therefore To lay his gay comparisons apart, And answer me declined, sword against sword, Ourselves alone. I’ll write it. Follow me.   [_Exeunt Antony and Ambassador._]  ENOBARBUS. Yes, like enough high-battled Caesar will Unstate his happiness, and be staged to th’ show Against a sworder! I see men’s judgments are A parcel of their fortunes, and things outward Do draw the inward quality after them To suffer all alike. That he should dream, Knowing all measures, the full Caesar will Answer his emptiness! Caesar, thou hast subdued His judgment too.   Enter a Servant.  SERVANT. A messenger from Caesar.  CLEOPATRA. What, no more ceremony? See, my women, Against the blown rose may they stop their nose That kneeled unto the buds. Admit him, sir.   [_Exit Servant._]  ENOBARBUS. [_Aside_.] Mine honesty and I begin to square. The loyalty well held to fools does make Our faith mere folly. Yet he that can endure To follow with allegiance a fallen lord Does conquer him that did his master conquer, And earns a place i’ th’ story.   Enter Thidias.  CLEOPATRA. Caesar’s will?  THIDIAS. Hear it apart.  CLEOPATRA. None but friends. Say boldly.  THIDIAS. So haply are they friends to Antony.  ENOBARBUS. He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has, Or needs not us. If Caesar please, our master Will leap to be his friend. For us, you know Whose he is we are, and that is Caesar’s.  THIDIAS. So.— Thus then, thou most renowned: Caesar entreats Not to consider in what case thou stand’st Further than he is Caesar.  CLEOPATRA. Go on; right royal.  THIDIAS. He knows that you embrace not Antony As you did love, but as you feared him.  CLEOPATRA. O!  THIDIAS. The scars upon your honour, therefore, he Does pity as constrained blemishes, Not as deserved.  CLEOPATRA. He is a god and knows What is most right. Mine honour was not yielded, But conquered merely.  ENOBARBUS. [_Aside_.] To be sure of that, I will ask Antony. Sir, sir, thou art so leaky That we must leave thee to thy sinking, for Thy dearest quit thee.   [_Exit Enobarbus._]  THIDIAS. Shall I say to Caesar What you require of him? For he partly begs To be desired to give. It much would please him That of his fortunes you should make a staff To lean upon. But it would warm his spirits To hear from me you had left Antony, And put yourself under his shroud, The universal landlord.  CLEOPATRA. What’s your name?  THIDIAS. My name is Thidias.  CLEOPATRA. Most kind messenger, Say to great Caesar this in deputation: I kiss his conqu’ring hand. Tell him I am prompt To lay my crown at’s feet, and there to kneel. Tell him, from his all-obeying breath I hear The doom of Egypt.  THIDIAS. ’Tis your noblest course. Wisdom and fortune combating together, If that the former dare but what it can, No chance may shake it. Give me grace to lay My duty on your hand.  CLEOPATRA. Your Caesar’s father oft, When he hath mused of taking kingdoms in, Bestowed his lips on that unworthy place As it rained kisses.   Enter Antony and Enobarbus.  ANTONY. Favours, by Jove that thunders! What art thou, fellow?  THIDIAS. One that but performs The bidding of the fullest man and worthiest To have command obeyed.  ENOBARBUS. [_Aside_.] You will be whipped.  ANTONY. Approach there.—Ah, you kite!—Now, gods and devils, Authority melts from me. Of late when I cried “Ho!” Like boys unto a muss, kings would start forth And cry “Your will?” Have you no ears? I am Antony yet.   Enter Servants.  Take hence this jack and whip him.  ENOBARBUS. ’Tis better playing with a lion’s whelp Than with an old one dying.  ANTONY. Moon and stars! Whip him. Were’t twenty of the greatest tributaries That do acknowledge Caesar, should I find them So saucy with the hand of she here—what’s her name Since she was Cleopatra? Whip him, fellows, Till like a boy you see him cringe his face And whine aloud for mercy. Take him hence.  THIDIAS. Mark Antony—  ANTONY. Tug him away. Being whipp’d, Bring him again. This jack of Caesar’s shall Bear us an errand to him.   [_Exeunt Servants with Thidias._]  You were half blasted ere I knew you. Ha! Have I my pillow left unpressed in Rome, Forborne the getting of a lawful race, And by a gem of women, to be abused By one that looks on feeders?  CLEOPATRA. Good my lord—  ANTONY. You have been a boggler ever. But when we in our viciousness grow hard— O misery on’t!—the wise gods seal our eyes, In our own filth drop our clear judgments, make us Adore our errors, laugh at’s while we strut To our confusion.  CLEOPATRA. O, is’t come to this?  ANTONY. I found you as a morsel cold upon Dead Caesar’s trencher; nay, you were a fragment Of Gneius Pompey’s, besides what hotter hours, Unregistered in vulgar fame, you have Luxuriously pick’d out. For I am sure, Though you can guess what temperance should be, You know not what it is.  CLEOPATRA. Wherefore is this?  ANTONY. To let a fellow that will take rewards And say “God quit you!” be familiar with My playfellow, your hand, this kingly seal And plighter of high hearts! O that I were Upon the hill of Basan, to outroar The horned herd! For I have savage cause, And to proclaim it civilly were like A haltered neck which does the hangman thank For being yare about him.   Enter a Servant with Thidias.  Is he whipped?  SERVANT. Soundly, my lord.  ANTONY. Cried he? And begged he pardon?  SERVANT. He did ask favour.  ANTONY. If that thy father live, let him repent Thou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorry To follow Caesar in his triumph, since Thou hast been whipped for following him. Henceforth The white hand of a lady fever thee; Shake thou to look on’t. Get thee back to Caesar; Tell him thy entertainment. Look thou say He makes me angry with him; for he seems Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am, Not what he knew I was. He makes me angry, And at this time most easy ’tis to do’t, When my good stars that were my former guides Have empty left their orbs and shot their fires Into th’ abysm of hell. If he mislike My speech and what is done, tell him he has Hipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom He may at pleasure whip, or hang, or torture, As he shall like, to quit me. Urge it thou. Hence with thy stripes, be gone.   [_Exit Thidias._]  CLEOPATRA. Have you done yet?  ANTONY. Alack, our terrene moon is now eclipsed, And it portends alone the fall of Antony.  CLEOPATRA. I must stay his time.  ANTONY. To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes With one that ties his points?  CLEOPATRA. Not know me yet?  ANTONY. Cold-hearted toward me?  CLEOPATRA. Ah, dear, if I be so, From my cold heart let heaven engender hail And poison it in the source, and the first stone Drop in my neck; as it determines, so Dissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite, Till, by degrees the memory of my womb, Together with my brave Egyptians all, By the discandying of this pelleted storm, Lie graveless, till the flies and gnats of Nile Have buried them for prey!  ANTONY. I am satisfied. Caesar sits down in Alexandria, where I will oppose his fate. Our force by land Hath nobly held; our severed navy too Have knit again, and fleet, threat’ning most sea-like. Where hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear, lady? If from the field I shall return once more To kiss these lips, I will appear in blood. I and my sword will earn our chronicle. There’s hope in’t yet.  CLEOPATRA. That’s my brave lord!  ANTONY. I will be treble-sinewed, hearted, breathed, And fight maliciously. For when mine hours Were nice and lucky, men did ransom lives Of me for jests. But now I’ll set my teeth And send to darkness all that stop me. Come, Let’s have one other gaudy night. Call to me All my sad captains. Fill our bowls once more Let’s mock the midnight bell.  CLEOPATRA. It is my birthday. I had thought t’have held it poor, but since my lord Is Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.  ANTONY. We will yet do well.  CLEOPATRA. Call all his noble captains to my lord.  ANTONY. Do so; we’ll speak to them; and tonight I’ll force The wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen, There’s sap in’t yet. The next time I do fight I’ll make Death love me, for I will contend Even with his pestilent scythe.   [_Exeunt all but Enobarbus._]  ENOBARBUS. Now he’ll outstare the lightning. To be furious Is to be frighted out of fear, and in that mood The dove will peck the estridge; and I see still A diminution in our captain’s brain Restores his heart. When valour preys on reason, It eats the sword it fights with. I will seek Some way to leave him.   [_Exit._]
  ACT IV
SCENE I. Caesar’s Camp at Alexandria.   Enter Caesar, Agrippa, and Maecenas, with his army. Caesar reading a letter.  CAESAR. He calls me boy, and chides as he had power To beat me out of Egypt. My messenger He hath whipped with rods; dares me to personal combat, Caesar to Antony. Let the old ruffian know I have many other ways to die; meantime Laugh at his challenge.  MAECENAS. Caesar must think, When one so great begins to rage, he’s hunted Even to falling. Give him no breath, but now Make boot of his distraction. Never anger Made good guard for itself.  CAESAR. Let our best heads Know that tomorrow the last of many battles We mean to fight. Within our files there are, Of those that served Mark Antony but late, Enough to fetch him in. See it done, And feast the army; we have store to do’t, And they have earned the waste. Poor Antony!   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. Alexandria. A Room in the Palace.   Enter Antony, Cleopatra, Enobarbus, Charmian, Iras, Alexas with  others.  ANTONY. He will not fight with me, Domitius?  ENOBARBUS. No.  ANTONY. Why should he not?  ENOBARBUS. He thinks, being twenty times of better fortune, He is twenty men to one.  ANTONY. Tomorrow, soldier, By sea and land I’ll fight. Or I will live, Or bathe my dying honour in the blood Shall make it live again. Woo’t thou fight well?  ENOBARBUS. I’ll strike, and cry “Take all.”  ANTONY. Well said. Come on. Call forth my household servants. Let’s tonight Be bounteous at our meal.—   Enter Servants.  Give me thy hand. Thou has been rightly honest; so hast thou, Thou, and thou, and thou. You have served me well, And kings have been your fellows.  CLEOPATRA. [_Aside to Enobarbus_.] What means this?  ENOBARBUS. [_Aside to Cleopatra_.] ’Tis one of those odd tricks which sorrow shoots Out of the mind.  ANTONY. And thou art honest too. I wish I could be made so many men, And all of you clapped up together in An Antony, that I might do you service So good as you have done.  ALL THE SERVANTS. The gods forbid!  ANTONY. Well, my good fellows, wait on me tonight. Scant not my cups, and make as much of me As when mine empire was your fellow too And suffered my command.  CLEOPATRA. [_Aside to Enobarbus_.] What does he mean?  ENOBARBUS. [_Aside to Cleopatra_.] To make his followers weep.  ANTONY. Tend me tonight; May be it is the period of your duty. Haply you shall not see me more, or if, A mangled shadow. Perchance tomorrow You’ll serve another master. I look on you As one that takes his leave. Mine honest friends, I turn you not away, but, like a master Married to your good service, stay till death. Tend me tonight two hours, I ask no more, And the gods yield you for’t!  ENOBARBUS. What mean you, sir, To give them this discomfort? Look, they weep, And I, an ass, am onion-eyed. For shame, Transform us not to women.  ANTONY. Ho, ho, ho! Now the witch take me if I meant it thus! Grace grow where those drops fall! My hearty friends, You take me in too dolorous a sense, For I spake to you for your comfort, did desire you To burn this night with torches. Know, my hearts, I hope well of tomorrow, and will lead you Where rather I’ll expect victorious life Than death and honour. Let’s to supper, come, And drown consideration.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. Alexandria. Before the Palace.   Enter a Company of Soldiers.  FIRST SOLDIER. Brother, good night. Tomorrow is the day.  SECOND SOLDIER. It will determine one way. Fare you well. Heard you of nothing strange about the streets?  FIRST SOLDIER. Nothing. What news?  SECOND SOLDIER. Belike ’tis but a rumour. Good night to you.  FIRST SOLDIER. Well, sir, good night.   Enter two other Soldiers.  SECOND SOLDIER. Soldiers, have careful watch.  THIRD SOLDIER. And you. Good night, good night.   [_They place themselves in every corner of the stage._]  SECOND SOLDIER. Here we. And if tomorrow Our navy thrive, I have an absolute hope Our landmen will stand up.  FIRST SOLDIER. ’Tis a brave army, and full of purpose.   [_Music of the hautboys under the stage._]  SECOND SOLDIER. Peace, what noise?  FIRST SOLDIER. List, list!  SECOND SOLDIER. Hark!  FIRST SOLDIER. Music i’ th’ air.  THIRD SOLDIER. Under the earth.  FOURTH SOLDIER. It signs well, does it not?  THIRD SOLDIER. No.  FIRST SOLDIER. Peace, I say! What should this mean?  SECOND SOLDIER. ’Tis the god Hercules, whom Antony loved, Now leaves him.  FIRST SOLDIER. Walk. Let’s see if other watchmen Do hear what we do.   [_They advance to another post._]  SECOND SOLDIER. How now, masters!  ALL. How now! How now! Do you hear this?  FIRST SOLDIER. Ay. Is’t not strange?  THIRD SOLDIER. Do you hear, masters? Do you hear?  FIRST SOLDIER. Follow the noise so far as we have quarter. Let’s see how it will give off.  ALL. Content. ’Tis strange.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IV. Alexandria. A Room in the Palace.   Enter Antony and Cleopatra with others.  ANTONY. Eros! Mine armour, Eros!  CLEOPATRA. Sleep a little.  ANTONY. No, my chuck.—Eros! Come, mine armour, Eros!   Enter Eros with armour.  Come, good fellow, put thine iron on. If fortune be not ours today, it is Because we brave her. Come.  CLEOPATRA. Nay, I’ll help too. What’s this for?  ANTONY. Ah, let be, let be! Thou art The armourer of my heart. False, false. This, this!  CLEOPATRA. Sooth, la, I’ll help. Thus it must be.  ANTONY. Well, well, We shall thrive now. Seest thou, my good fellow? Go put on thy defences.  EROS. Briefly, sir.  CLEOPATRA. Is not this buckled well?  ANTONY. Rarely, rarely. He that unbuckles this, till we do please To daff’t for our repose, shall hear a storm. Thou fumblest, Eros, and my queen’s a squire More tight at this than thou. Dispatch. O love, That thou couldst see my wars today, and knew’st The royal occupation, thou shouldst see A workman in’t.   Enter an Officer, armed.  Good morrow to thee. Welcome. Thou look’st like him that knows a warlike charge. To business that we love we rise betime And go to’t with delight.  OFFICER. A thousand, sir, Early though’t be, have on their riveted trim And at the port expect you.   [_Shout. Trumpets flourish._]   Enter other Captains and Soldiers.  CAPTAIN. The morn is fair. Good morrow, general.  ALL. Good morrow, general.  ANTONY. ’Tis well blown, lads. This morning, like the spirit of a youth That means to be of note, begins betimes. So, so. Come, give me that. This way. Well said. Fare thee well, dame. Whate’er becomes of me, This is a soldier’s kiss. [_Kisses her._] Rebukeable And worthy shameful check it were, to stand On more mechanic compliment. I’ll leave thee Now like a man of steel.—You that will fight, Follow me close, I’ll bring you to’t. Adieu.   [_Exeunt Antony, Eros, Captains and Soldiers._]  CHARMIAN. Please you, retire to your chamber.  CLEOPATRA. Lead me. He goes forth gallantly. That he and Caesar might Determine this great war in single fight! Then Antony—but now—. Well, on.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE V. Antony’s camp near Alexandria.   Trumpets sound. Enter Antony and Eros, a Soldier meeting them.  SOLDIER. The gods make this a happy day to Antony!  ANTONY. Would thou and those thy scars had once prevailed To make me fight at land!  SOLDIER. Hadst thou done so, The kings that have revolted and the soldier That has this morning left thee would have still Followed thy heels.  ANTONY. Who’s gone this morning?  SOLDIER. Who? One ever near thee. Call for Enobarbus, He shall not hear thee, or from Caesar’s camp Say “I am none of thine.”  ANTONY. What sayest thou?  SOLDIER. Sir, He is with Caesar.  EROS. Sir, his chests and treasure He has not with him.  ANTONY. Is he gone?  SOLDIER. Most certain.  ANTONY. Go, Eros, send his treasure after. Do it. Detain no jot, I charge thee. Write to him— I will subscribe—gentle adieus and greetings. Say that I wish he never find more cause To change a master. O, my fortunes have Corrupted honest men! Dispatch.—Enobarbus!   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE VI. Alexandria. Caesar’s camp.   Flourish. Enter Agrippa, Caesar with Enobarbus and Dolabella.  CAESAR. Go forth, Agrippa, and begin the fight. Our will is Antony be took alive; Make it so known.  AGRIPPA. Caesar, I shall.   [_Exit._]  CAESAR. The time of universal peace is near. Prove this a prosp’rous day, the three-nooked world Shall bear the olive freely.   Enter a Messenger.  MESSENGER. Antony Is come into the field.  CAESAR. Go charge Agrippa Plant those that have revolted in the van That Antony may seem to spend his fury Upon himself.   [_Exeunt Caesar and his Train._]  ENOBARBUS. Alexas did revolt and went to Jewry on Affairs of Antony; there did dissuade Great Herod to incline himself to Caesar And leave his master Antony. For this pains Caesar hath hanged him. Canidius and the rest That fell away have entertainment but No honourable trust. I have done ill, Of which I do accuse myself so sorely That I will joy no more.   Enter a Soldier of Caesar’s.  SOLDIER. Enobarbus, Antony Hath after thee sent all thy treasure, with His bounty overplus. The messenger Came on my guard, and at thy tent is now Unloading of his mules.  ENOBARBUS. I give it you.  SOLDIER. Mock not, Enobarbus. I tell you true. Best you safed the bringer Out of the host. I must attend mine office, Or would have done’t myself. Your emperor Continues still a Jove.   [_Exit._]  ENOBARBUS. I am alone the villain of the earth, And feel I am so most. O Antony, Thou mine of bounty, how wouldst thou have paid My better service, when my turpitude Thou dost so crown with gold! This blows my heart. If swift thought break it not, a swifter mean Shall outstrike thought, but thought will do’t, I feel. I fight against thee! No, I will go seek Some ditch wherein to die; the foul’st best fits My latter part of life.   [_Exit._]  SCENE VII. Field of battle between the Camps.   Alarum. Drums and Trumpets. Enter Agrippa and others.  AGRIPPA. Retire! We have engaged ourselves too far. Caesar himself has work, and our oppression Exceeds what we expected.   [_Exeunt._]   Alarums. Enter Antony and Scarus wounded.  SCARUS. O my brave emperor, this is fought indeed! Had we done so at first, we had droven them home With clouts about their heads.  ANTONY. Thou bleed’st apace.  SCARUS. I had a wound here that was like a T, But now ’tis made an H.   _Sounds retreat far off._ ANTONY. They do retire.  SCARUS. We’ll beat ’em into bench-holes. I have yet Room for six scotches more.   Enter Eros.  EROS. They are beaten, sir, and our advantage serves For a fair victory.  SCARUS. Let us score their backs And snatch ’em up as we take hares, behind. ’Tis sport to maul a runner.  ANTONY. I will reward thee Once for thy sprightly comfort, and tenfold For thy good valour. Come thee on.  SCARUS. I’ll halt after.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE VIII. Under the Walls of Alexandria.   Alarum. Enter Antony again in a march; Scarus with others.  ANTONY. We have beat him to his camp. Run one before And let the Queen know of our gests. Tomorrow, Before the sun shall see’s, we’ll spill the blood That has today escaped. I thank you all, For doughty-handed are you, and have fought Not as you served the cause, but as’t had been Each man’s like mine. You have shown all Hectors. Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends, Tell them your feats; whilst they with joyful tears Wash the congealment from your wounds and kiss The honoured gashes whole.   Enter Cleopatra.  [_To Scarus_.] Give me thy hand. To this great fairy I’ll commend thy acts, Make her thanks bless thee. O thou day o’ th’ world, Chain mine armed neck. Leap thou, attire and all, Through proof of harness to my heart, and there Ride on the pants triumphing.  CLEOPATRA. Lord of lords! O infinite virtue, com’st thou smiling from The world’s great snare uncaught?  ANTONY. Mine nightingale, We have beat them to their beds. What, girl! Though grey Do something mingle with our younger brown, yet ha’ we A brain that nourishes our nerves and can Get goal for goal of youth. Behold this man. Commend unto his lips thy favouring hand.— Kiss it, my warrior. He hath fought today As if a god, in hate of mankind, had Destroyed in such a shape.  CLEOPATRA. I’ll give thee, friend, An armour all of gold. It was a king’s.  ANTONY. He has deserved it, were it carbuncled Like holy Phœbus’ car. Give me thy hand. Through Alexandria make a jolly march; Bear our hacked targets like the men that owe them. Had our great palace the capacity To camp this host, we all would sup together And drink carouses to the next day’s fate, Which promises royal peril.—Trumpeters, With brazen din blast you the city’s ear; Make mingle with our rattling tabourines, That heaven and earth may strike their sounds together, Applauding our approach.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IX. Caesar’s camp.   Enter a Sentry and his company. Enobarbus follows.  SENTRY. If we be not relieved within this hour, We must return to th’ court of guard. The night Is shiny, and they say we shall embattle By th’ second hour i’ th’ morn.  FIRST WATCH. This last day was a shrewd one to’s.  ENOBARBUS. O, bear me witness, night.—  SECOND WATCH. What man is this?  FIRST WATCH. Stand close and list him.  ENOBARBUS. Be witness to me, O thou blessed moon, When men revolted shall upon record Bear hateful memory, poor Enobarbus did Before thy face repent.  SENTRY. Enobarbus?  SECOND WATCH. Peace! Hark further.  ENOBARBUS. O sovereign mistress of true melancholy, The poisonous damp of night disponge upon me, That life, a very rebel to my will, May hang no longer on me. Throw my heart Against the flint and hardness of my fault, Which, being dried with grief, will break to powder And finish all foul thoughts. O Antony, Nobler than my revolt is infamous, Forgive me in thine own particular, But let the world rank me in register A master-leaver and a fugitive. O Antony! O Antony!   [_Dies._]  FIRST WATCH. Let’s speak to him.  SENTRY. Let’s hear him, for the things he speaks may concern Caesar.  SECOND WATCH. Let’s do so. But he sleeps.  SENTRY. Swoons rather, for so bad a prayer as his Was never yet for sleep.  FIRST WATCH. Go we to him.  SECOND WATCH. Awake, sir, awake! Speak to us.  FIRST WATCH. Hear you, sir?  SENTRY. The hand of death hath raught him.   [_Drums afar off._]  Hark! The drums Demurely wake the sleepers. Let us bear him To th’ court of guard; he is of note. Our hour Is fully out.  SECOND WATCH. Come on, then. He may recover yet.   [_Exeunt with the body._]  SCENE X. Ground between the two Camps.   Enter Antony and Scarus with their army.  ANTONY. Their preparation is today by sea; We please them not by land.  SCARUS. For both, my lord.  ANTONY. I would they’d fight i’ th’ fire or i’ th’ air; We’d fight there too. But this it is: our foot Upon the hills adjoining to the city Shall stay with us—order for sea is given; They have put forth the haven— Where their appointment we may best discover And look on their endeavour.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE XI. Another part of the Ground.   Enter Caesar and his army.  CAESAR. But being charged, we will be still by land, Which, as I take’t, we shall, for his best force Is forth to man his galleys. To the vales, And hold our best advantage.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE XII. Another part of the Ground.   Alarum afar off, as at a sea fight. Enter Antony and Scarus.  ANTONY. Yet they are not joined. Where yond pine does stand I shall discover all. I’ll bring thee word Straight how ’tis like to go.   [_Exit._]  SCARUS. Swallows have built In Cleopatra’s sails their nests. The augurs Say they know not, they cannot tell; look grimly, And dare not speak their knowledge. Antony Is valiant and dejected, and by starts His fretted fortunes give him hope and fear Of what he has and has not.   Enter Antony.  ANTONY. All is lost! This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me. My fleet hath yielded to the foe, and yonder They cast their caps up and carouse together Like friends long lost. Triple-turned whore! ’Tis thou Hast sold me to this novice, and my heart Makes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly; For when I am revenged upon my charm, I have done all. Bid them all fly! Be gone!   [_Exit Scarus._]  O sun, thy uprise shall I see no more. Fortune and Antony part here; even here Do we shake hands. All come to this! The hearts That spanieled me at heels, to whom I gave Their wishes, do discandy, melt their sweets On blossoming Caesar, and this pine is barked That overtopped them all. Betray’d I am: O this false soul of Egypt! This grave charm, Whose eye becked forth my wars and called them home, Whose bosom was my crownet, my chief end, Like a right gypsy hath at fast and loose Beguiled me to the very heart of loss. What, Eros, Eros!   Enter Cleopatra.  Ah, thou spell! Avaunt!  CLEOPATRA. Why is my lord enraged against his love?  ANTONY. Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving And blemish Caesar’s triumph. Let him take thee And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians! Follow his chariot, like the greatest spot Of all thy sex; most monster-like be shown For poor’st diminutives, for dolts, and let Patient Octavia plough thy visage up With her prepared nails.   [_Exit Cleopatra._]  ’Tis well thou’rt gone, If it be well to live; but better ’twere Thou fell’st into my fury, for one death Might have prevented many.—Eros, ho!— The shirt of Nessus is upon me. Teach me, Alcides, thou mine ancestor, thy rage. Let me lodge Lichas on the horns o’ th’ moon, And with those hands that grasped the heaviest club Subdue my worthiest self. The witch shall die. To the young Roman boy she hath sold me, and I fall Under this plot. She dies for’t.—Eros, ho!   [_Exit._]  SCENE XIII. Alexandria. A Room in the Palace.   Enter Cleopatra, Charmian, Iras and Mardian.  CLEOPATRA. Help me, my women! O, he is more mad Than Telamon for his shield; the boar of Thessaly Was never so embossed.  CHARMIAN. To th’ monument! There lock yourself and send him word you are dead. The soul and body rive not more in parting Than greatness going off.  CLEOPATRA. To th’ monument! Mardian, go tell him I have slain myself. Say that the last I spoke was “Antony”, And word it, prithee, piteously. Hence, Mardian, And bring me how he takes my death.—To th’ monument!   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE XIV. Alexandria. Another Room.   Enter Antony and Eros.  ANTONY. Eros, thou yet behold’st me?  EROS. Ay, noble lord.  ANTONY. Sometime we see a cloud that’s dragonish, A vapour sometime like a bear or lion, A towered citadel, a pendant rock, A forked mountain, or blue promontory With trees upon’t, that nod unto the world And mock our eyes with air. Thou hast seen these signs. They are black vesper’s pageants.  EROS. Ay, my lord.  ANTONY. That which is now a horse, even with a thought The rack dislimns and makes it indistinct As water is in water.  EROS. It does, my lord.  ANTONY. My good knave Eros, now thy captain is Even such a body. Here I am Antony, Yet cannot hold this visible shape, my knave. I made these wars for Egypt, and the Queen, Whose heart I thought I had, for she had mine, Which, whilst it was mine, had annexed unto’t A million more, now lost—she, Eros, has Packed cards with Caesar, and false-played my glory Unto an enemy’s triumph. Nay, weep not, gentle Eros. There is left us Ourselves to end ourselves.   Enter Mardian.  O, thy vile lady! She has robbed me of my sword.  MARDIAN. No, Antony, My mistress loved thee and her fortunes mingled With thine entirely.  ANTONY. Hence, saucy eunuch! Peace! She hath betrayed me and shall die the death.  MARDIAN. Death of one person can be paid but once, And that she has discharged. What thou wouldst do Is done unto thy hand. The last she spake Was “Antony! Most noble Antony!” Then in the midst a tearing groan did break The name of Antony; it was divided Between her heart and lips. She rendered life, Thy name so buried in her.  ANTONY. Dead, then?  MARDIAN. Dead.  ANTONY. Unarm, Eros. The long day’s task is done, And we must sleep.—That thou depart’st hence safe Does pay thy labour richly. Go.   [_Exit Mardian._]  Off, pluck off! The sevenfold shield of Ajax cannot keep The battery from my heart. O, cleave, my sides! Heart, once be stronger than thy continent; Crack thy frail case! Apace, Eros, apace! No more a soldier. Bruised pieces, go; You have been nobly borne. From me awhile.   [_Exit Eros._]  I will o’ertake thee, Cleopatra, and Weep for my pardon. So it must be, for now All length is torture. Since the torch is out, Lie down, and stray no farther. Now all labour Mars what it does; yea, very force entangles Itself with strength. Seal then, and all is done. Eros!—I come, my queen.—Eros!—Stay for me. Where souls do couch on flowers, we’ll hand in hand, And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze. Dido and her Aeneas shall want troops, And all the haunt be ours.—Come, Eros, Eros!   Enter Eros.  EROS. What would my lord?  ANTONY. Since Cleopatra died, I have lived in such dishonour that the gods Detest my baseness. I, that with my sword Quartered the world, and o’er green Neptune’s back With ships made cities, condemn myself to lack The courage of a woman; less noble mind Than she which, by her death, our Caesar tells “I am conqueror of myself.” Thou art sworn, Eros, That when the exigent should come, which now Is come indeed, when I should see behind me Th’ inevitable prosecution of Disgrace and horror, that on my command Thou then wouldst kill me. Do’t. The time is come. Thou strik’st not me; ’tis Caesar thou defeat’st. Put colour in thy cheek.  EROS. The gods withhold me! Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts, Though enemy, lost aim and could not?  ANTONY. Eros, Wouldst thou be windowed in great Rome and see Thy master thus with pleached arms, bending down His corrigible neck, his face subdued To penetrative shame, whilst the wheeled seat Of fortunate Caesar, drawn before him, branded His baseness that ensued?  EROS. I would not see’t.  ANTONY. Come, then, for with a wound I must be cured. Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn Most useful for thy country.  EROS. O, sir, pardon me!  ANTONY. When I did make thee free, swor’st thou not then To do this when I bade thee? Do it at once, Or thy precedent services are all But accidents unpurposed. Draw, and come.  EROS. Turn from me then that noble countenance Wherein the worship of the whole world lies.  ANTONY. Lo thee!   [_Turning from him._]  EROS. My sword is drawn.  ANTONY. Then let it do at once The thing why thou hast drawn it.  EROS. My dear master, My captain and my emperor, let me say, Before I strike this bloody stroke, farewell.  ANTONY. ’Tis said, man, and farewell.  EROS. Farewell, great chief. Shall I strike now?  ANTONY. Now, Eros.  EROS. Why, there then! [_kills himself_] Thus do I escape the sorrow Of Antony’s death.   [_Dies._]  ANTONY. Thrice nobler than myself! Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what I should and thou couldst not. My queen and Eros Have by their brave instruction got upon me A nobleness in record. But I will be A bridegroom in my death and run into’t As to a lover’s bed. Come then, and, Eros, Thy master dies thy scholar. To do thus   [_Falling on his sword._]  I learned of thee. How? Not dead? Not dead? The guard, ho! O, dispatch me!   Enter a company of the Guard, one of them Dercetus.  FIRST GUARD. What’s the noise?  ANTONY. I have done my work ill, friends. O, make an end Of what I have begun.  SECOND GUARD. The star is fallen.  FIRST GUARD. And time is at his period.  ALL. Alas, and woe!  ANTONY. Let him that loves me strike me dead.  FIRST GUARD. Not I.  SECOND GUARD. Nor I.  THIRD GUARD. Nor anyone.   [_Exeunt guard._]  DERCETUS. Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly. This sword but shown to Caesar with this tidings, Shall enter me with him.   Enter Diomedes.  DIOMEDES. Where’s Antony?  DERCETUS. There, Diomed, there.  DIOMEDES. Lives he? Wilt thou not answer, man?   [_Exit Dercetus._]  ANTONY. Art thou there, Diomed? Draw thy sword and give me Sufficing strokes for death.  DIOMEDES. Most absolute lord, My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee.  ANTONY. When did she send thee?  DIOMEDES. Now, my lord.  ANTONY. Where is she?  DIOMEDES. Locked in her monument. She had a prophesying fear Of what hath come to pass. For when she saw— Which never shall be found—you did suspect She had disposed with Caesar, and that your rage Would not be purged, she sent you word she was dead; But fearing since how it might work, hath sent Me to proclaim the truth, and I am come, I dread, too late.  ANTONY. Too late, good Diomed. Call my guard, I prithee.  DIOMEDES. What, ho! The emperor’s guard! The guard, what ho! Come, your lord calls!   Enter four or five of the Guard of Antony.  ANTONY. Bear me, good friends, where Cleopatra bides. ’Tis the last service that I shall command you.  FIRST GUARD. Woe, woe are we, sir, you may not live to wear All your true followers out.  ALL. Most heavy day!  ANTONY. Nay, good my fellows, do not please sharp fate To grace it with your sorrows. Bid that welcome Which comes to punish us, and we punish it, Seeming to bear it lightly. Take me up. I have led you oft; carry me now, good friends, And have my thanks for all.   [_Exeunt, bearing Antony._]  SCENE XV. Alexandria. A monument.   Enter Cleopatra and her maids aloft, with Charmian and Iras.  CLEOPATRA. O Charmian, I will never go from hence.  CHARMIAN. Be comforted, dear madam.  CLEOPATRA. No, I will not. All strange and terrible events are welcome, But comforts we despise. Our size of sorrow, Proportioned to our cause, must be as great As that which makes it.   Enter, below Diomedes.  How now! Is he dead?  DIOMEDES. His death’s upon him, but not dead. Look out o’ th’ other side your monument; His guard have brought him thither.   Enter, below Antony borne by the Guard.  CLEOPATRA. O sun, Burn the great sphere thou mov’st in! Darkling stand The varying shore o’ th’ world. O Antony, Antony, Antony! Help, Charmian! Help, Iras, help! Help, friends below! Let’s draw him hither.  ANTONY. Peace! Not Caesar’s valour hath o’erthrown Antony, But Antony’s hath triumphed on itself.  CLEOPATRA. So it should be, that none but Antony Should conquer Antony, but woe ’tis so!  ANTONY. I am dying, Egypt, dying. Only I here importune death awhile until Of many thousand kisses the poor last I lay upon thy lips.  CLEOPATRA. I dare not, dear Dear my lord, pardon. I dare not, Lest I be taken. Not th’ imperious show Of the full-fortuned Caesar ever shall Be brooched with me; if knife, drugs, serpents, have Edge, sting, or operation, I am safe. Your wife Octavia, with her modest eyes And still conclusion, shall acquire no honour Demuring upon me. But come, come, Antony— Help me, my women—we must draw thee up. Assist, good friends.  ANTONY. O, quick, or I am gone.  CLEOPATRA. Here’s sport indeed! How heavy weighs my lord! Our strength is all gone into heaviness; That makes the weight. Had I great Juno’s power, The strong-winged Mercury should fetch thee up And set thee by Jove’s side. Yet come a little; Wishers were ever fools. O come, come come,   [_They heave Antony aloft to Cleopatra._]  And welcome, welcome! Die where thou hast lived; Quicken with kissing. Had my lips that power, Thus would I wear them out.  ALL. A heavy sight!  ANTONY. I am dying, Egypt, dying. Give me some wine, and let me speak a little.  CLEOPATRA. No, let me speak, and let me rail so high That the false huswife Fortune break her wheel, Provoked by my offence.  ANTONY. One word, sweet queen: Of Caesar seek your honour, with your safety. O!  CLEOPATRA. They do not go together.  ANTONY. Gentle, hear me. None about Caesar trust but Proculeius.  CLEOPATRA. My resolution and my hands I’ll trust; None about Caesar.  ANTONY. The miserable change now at my end Lament nor sorrow at, but please your thoughts In feeding them with those my former fortunes Wherein I lived the greatest prince o’ th’ world, The noblest; and do now not basely die, Not cowardly put off my helmet to My countryman; a Roman by a Roman Valiantly vanquished. Now my spirit is going; I can no more.  CLEOPATRA. Noblest of men, woo’t die? Hast thou no care of me? Shall I abide In this dull world, which in thy absence is No better than a sty? O, see, my women,   [_ Antony dies._]  The crown o’ th’ earth doth melt.—My lord! O, withered is the garland of the war, The soldier’s pole is fallen; young boys and girls Are level now with men. The odds is gone, And there is nothing left remarkable Beneath the visiting moon.   [_Faints._]  CHARMIAN. O, quietness, lady!  IRAS. She is dead too, our sovereign.  CHARMIAN. Lady!  IRAS. Madam!  CHARMIAN. O madam, madam, madam!  IRAS. Royal Egypt, Empress!  CHARMIAN. Peace, peace, Iras!  CLEOPATRA. No more but e’en a woman, and commanded By such poor passion as the maid that milks And does the meanest chares. It were for me To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods, To tell them that this world did equal theirs Till they had stolen our jewel. All’s but naught; Patience is sottish, and impatience does Become a dog that’s mad. Then is it sin To rush into the secret house of death Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women? What, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian? My noble girls! Ah, women, women! Look, Our lamp is spent, it’s out! Good sirs, take heart. We’ll bury him; and then, what’s brave, what’s noble, Let’s do it after the high Roman fashion And make death proud to take us. Come, away. This case of that huge spirit now is cold. Ah, women, women! Come, we have no friend But resolution and the briefest end.   [_Exeunt, bearing off Antony’s body._]

  ACT I  SCENE I. An Orchard near Oliver’s house
Enter Orlando and Adam.  ORLANDO. As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns, and, as thou sayst, charged my brother, on his blessing, to breed me well; and there begins my sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and report speaks goldenly of his profit. For my part, he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you that keeping, for a gentleman of my birth, that differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses are bred better, for, besides that they are fair with their feeding, they are taught their manage and to that end riders dearly hired; but I, his brother, gain nothing under him but growth, for the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from me. He lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that grieves me, and the spirit of my father, which I think is within me, begins to mutiny against this servitude. I will no longer endure it, though yet I know no wise remedy how to avoid it.  Enter Oliver.  ADAM. Yonder comes my master, your brother.  ORLANDO. Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will shake me up.  [_Adam retires._]  OLIVER. Now, sir, what make you here?  ORLANDO. Nothing. I am not taught to make anything.  OLIVER. What mar you then, sir?  ORLANDO. Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.  OLIVER. Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.  ORLANDO. Shall I keep your hogs, and eat husks with them? What prodigal portion have I spent that I should come to such penury?  OLIVER. Know you where you are, sir?  ORLANDO. O, sir, very well: here in your orchard.  OLIVER. Know you before whom, sir?  ORLANDO. Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know you are my eldest brother, and in the gentle condition of blood you should so know me. The courtesy of nations allows you my better in that you are the first-born, but the same tradition takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers betwixt us. I have as much of my father in me as you, albeit I confess your coming before me is nearer to his reverence.  OLIVER. What, boy!  ORLANDO. Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.  OLIVER. Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?  ORLANDO. I am no villain. I am the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys; he was my father, and he is thrice a villain that says such a father begot villains. Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy tongue for saying so. Thou has railed on thyself.  ADAM. [_Coming forward_.] Sweet masters, be patient. For your father’s remembrance, be at accord.  OLIVER. Let me go, I say.  ORLANDO. I will not till I please. You shall hear me. My father charged you in his will to give me good education. You have trained me like a peasant, obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in me, and I will no longer endure it. Therefore allow me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or give me the poor allottery my father left me by testament; with that I will go buy my fortunes.  OLIVER. And what wilt thou do? Beg when that is spent? Well, sir, get you in. I will not long be troubled with you. You shall have some part of your will. I pray you leave me.  ORLANDO. I no further offend you than becomes me for my good.  OLIVER. Get you with him, you old dog.  ADAM. Is “old dog” my reward? Most true, I have lost my teeth in your service. God be with my old master. He would not have spoke such a word.  [_Exeunt Orlando and Adam._]  OLIVER. Is it even so? Begin you to grow upon me? I will physic your rankness, and yet give no thousand crowns neither. Holla, Dennis!  Enter Dennis.  DENNIS Calls your worship?  OLIVER. Was not Charles, the Duke’s wrestler, here to speak with me?  DENNIS So please you, he is here at the door and importunes access to you.  OLIVER. Call him in.  [_Exit Dennis._]  ’Twill be a good way, and tomorrow the wrestling is.  Enter Charles.  CHARLES. Good morrow to your worship.  OLIVER. Good Monsieur Charles. What’s the new news at the new court?  CHARLES. There’s no news at the court, sir, but the old news. That is, the old Duke is banished by his younger brother the new Duke, and three or four loving lords have put themselves into voluntary exile with him, whose lands and revenues enrich the new Duke; therefore he gives them good leave to wander.  OLIVER. Can you tell if Rosalind, the Duke’s daughter, be banished with her father?  CHARLES. O, no; for the Duke’s daughter, her cousin, so loves her, being ever from their cradles bred together, that she would have followed her exile or have died to stay behind her. She is at the court and no less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter, and never two ladies loved as they do.  OLIVER. Where will the old Duke live?  CHARLES. They say he is already in the Forest of Arden, and a many merry men with him; and there they live like the old Robin Hood of England. They say many young gentlemen flock to him every day and fleet the time carelessly, as they did in the golden world.  OLIVER. What, you wrestle tomorrow before the new Duke?  CHARLES. Marry, do I, sir, and I came to acquaint you with a matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition to come in disguised against me to try a fall. Tomorrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit, and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well. Your brother is but young and tender, and for your love I would be loath to foil him, as I must for my own honour if he come in. Therefore, out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you withal, that either you might stay him from his intendment, or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into, in that it is a thing of his own search and altogether against my will.  OLIVER. Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had myself notice of my brother’s purpose herein, and have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from it; but he is resolute. I’ll tell thee, Charles, it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full of ambition, an envious emulator of every man’s good parts, a secret and villainous contriver against me his natural brother. Therefore use thy discretion. I had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger. And thou wert best look to’t; for if thou dost him any slight disgrace, or if he do not mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise against thee by poison, entrap thee by some treacherous device, and never leave thee till he hath ta’en thy life by some indirect means or other. For I assure thee (and almost with tears I speak it) there is not one so young and so villainous this day living. I speak but brotherly of him, but should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must blush and weep, and thou must look pale and wonder.  CHARLES. I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come tomorrow I’ll give him his payment. If ever he go alone again I’ll never wrestle for prize more. And so, God keep your worship.  [_Exit._]  OLIVER. Farewell, good Charles. Now will I stir this gamester. I hope I shall see an end of him; for my soul—yet I know not why—hates nothing more than he. Yet he’s gentle, never schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of all sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much in the heart of the world, and especially of my own people, who best know him, that I am altogether misprized. But it shall not be so long; this wrestler shall clear all. Nothing remains but that I kindle the boy thither, which now I’ll go about.  [_Exit._]  SCENE II. A Lawn before the Duke’s Palace  Enter Rosalind and Celia.  CELIA. I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.  ROSALIND. Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of, and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could teach me to forget a banished father, you must not learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.  CELIA. Herein I see thou lov’st me not with the full weight that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father, had banished thy uncle, the Duke my father, so thou hadst been still with me, I could have taught my love to take thy father for mine. So wouldst thou, if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously tempered as mine is to thee.  ROSALIND. Well, I will forget the condition of my estate to rejoice in yours.  CELIA. You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is like to have; and truly, when he dies thou shalt be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy father perforce, I will render thee again in affection. By mine honour I will! And when I break that oath, let me turn monster. Therefore, my sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.  ROSALIND. From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let me see—what think you of falling in love?  CELIA. Marry, I prithee do, to make sport withal; but love no man in good earnest, nor no further in sport neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst in honour come off again.  ROSALIND. What shall be our sport, then?  CELIA. Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.  ROSALIND. I would we could do so, for her benefits are mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her gifts to women.  CELIA. ’Tis true, for those that she makes fair she scarce makes honest, and those that she makes honest she makes very ill-favouredly.  ROSALIND. Nay, now thou goest from Fortune’s office to Nature’s. Fortune reigns in gifts of the world, not in the lineaments of Nature.  Enter Touchstone.  CELIA. No? When Nature hath made a fair creature, may she not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?  ROSALIND. Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when Fortune makes Nature’s natural the cutter-off of Nature’s wit.  CELIA. Peradventure this is not Fortune’s work neither, but Nature’s, who perceiveth our natural wits too dull to reason of such goddesses, and hath sent this natural for our whetstone; for always the dullness of the fool is the whetstone of the wits.—How now, wit, whither wander you?  TOUCHSTONE. Mistress, you must come away to your father.  CELIA. Were you made the messenger?  TOUCHSTONE. No, by mine honour, but I was bid to come for you.  ROSALIND. Where learned you that oath, fool?  TOUCHSTONE. Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they were good pancakes, and swore by his honour the mustard was naught. Now, I’ll stand to it, the pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and yet was not the knight forsworn.  CELIA. How prove you that in the great heap of your knowledge?  ROSALIND. Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.  TOUCHSTONE. Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and swear by your beards that I am a knave.  CELIA. By our beards, if we had them, thou art.  TOUCHSTONE. By my knavery, if I had it, then I were. But if you swear by that that is not, you are not forsworn. No more was this knight swearing by his honour, for he never had any; or if he had, he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancackes or that mustard.  CELIA. Prithee, who is’t that thou mean’st?  TOUCHSTONE. One that old Frederick, your father, loves.  CELIA. My father’s love is enough to honour him. Enough! Speak no more of him. You’ll be whipped for taxation one of these days.  TOUCHSTONE. The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly.  CELIA. By my troth, thou sayest true. For since the little wit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery that wise men have makes a great show. Here comes Monsieur Le Beau.  Enter Le Beau.  ROSALIND. With his mouth full of news.  CELIA. Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young.  ROSALIND. Then shall we be news-crammed.  CELIA. All the better; we shall be the more marketable. _Bonjour_, Monsieur Le Beau. What’s the news?  LE BEAU. Fair princess, you have lost much good sport.  CELIA. Sport! Of what colour?  LE BEAU. What colour, madam? How shall I answer you?  ROSALIND. As wit and fortune will.  TOUCHSTONE. Or as the destinies decrees.  CELIA. Well said. That was laid on with a trowel.  TOUCHSTONE. Nay, if I keep not my rank—  ROSALIND. Thou losest thy old smell.  LE BEAU. You amaze me, ladies. I would have told you of good wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.  ROSALIND. Yet tell us the manner of the wrestling.  LE BEAU. I will tell you the beginning and, if it please your ladyships, you may see the end, for the best is yet to do; and here, where you are, they are coming to perform it.  CELIA. Well, the beginning that is dead and buried.  LE BEAU. There comes an old man and his three sons—  CELIA. I could match this beginning with an old tale.  LE BEAU. Three proper young men of excellent growth and presence.  ROSALIND. With bills on their necks: “Be it known unto all men by these presents.”  LE BEAU. The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the Duke’s wrestler, which Charles in a moment threw him and broke three of his ribs, that there is little hope of life in him. So he served the second, and so the third. Yonder they lie, the poor old man their father making such pitiful dole over them that all the beholders take his part with weeping.  ROSALIND. Alas!  TOUCHSTONE. But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies have lost?  LE BEAU. Why, this that I speak of.  TOUCHSTONE. Thus men may grow wiser every day. It is the first time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies.  CELIA. Or I, I promise thee.  ROSALIND. But is there any else longs to see this broken music in his sides? Is there yet another dotes upon rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?  LE BEAU. You must if you stay here, for here is the place appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to perform it.  CELIA. Yonder, sure, they are coming. Let us now stay and see it.  Flourish. Enter Duke Frederick, Lords, Orlando, Charles and Attendants.  DUKE FREDERICK. Come on. Since the youth will not be entreated, his own peril on his forwardness.  ROSALIND. Is yonder the man?  LE BEAU. Even he, madam.  CELIA. Alas, he is too young. Yet he looks successfully.  DUKE FREDERICK. How now, daughter and cousin? Are you crept hither to see the wrestling?  ROSALIND. Ay, my liege, so please you give us leave.  DUKE FREDERICK. You will take little delight in it, I can tell you, there is such odds in the man. In pity of the challenger’s youth I would fain dissuade him, but he will not be entreated. Speak to him, ladies; see if you can move him.  CELIA. Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.  DUKE FREDERICK. Do so; I’ll not be by.  [_Duke Frederick steps aside._]  LE BEAU. Monsieur the challenger, the Princess calls for you.  ORLANDO. I attend them with all respect and duty.  ROSALIND. Young man, have you challenged Charles the wrestler?  ORLANDO. No, fair princess. He is the general challenger. I come but in as others do, to try with him the strength of my youth.  CELIA. Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your years. You have seen cruel proof of this man’s strength. If you saw yourself with your eyes or knew yourself with your judgement, the fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal enterprise. We pray you for your own sake to embrace your own safety and give over this attempt.  ROSALIND. Do, young sir. Your reputation shall not therefore be misprized. We will make it our suit to the Duke that the wrestling might not go forward.  ORLANDO. I beseech you, punish me not with your hard thoughts, wherein I confess me much guilty to deny so fair and excellent ladies anything. But let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial, wherein if I be foiled there is but one shamed that was never gracious; if killed, but one dead that is willing to be so. I shall do my friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me; the world no injury, for in it I have nothing. Only in the world I fill up a place, which may be better supplied when I have made it empty.  ROSALIND. The little strength that I have, I would it were with you.  CELIA. And mine to eke out hers.  ROSALIND. Fare you well. Pray heaven I be deceived in you.  CELIA. Your heart’s desires be with you.  CHARLES. Come, where is this young gallant that is so desirous to lie with his mother earth?  ORLANDO. Ready, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working.  DUKE FREDERICK. You shall try but one fall.  CHARLES. No, I warrant your grace you shall not entreat him to a second, that have so mightily persuaded him from a first.  ORLANDO. You mean to mock me after; you should not have mocked me before. But come your ways.  ROSALIND. Now, Hercules be thy speed, young man!  CELIA. I would I were invisible, to catch the strong fellow by the leg.  [_Orlando and Charles wrestle._]  ROSALIND. O excellent young man!  CELIA. If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who should down.  [_Charles is thrown. Shout._]  DUKE FREDERICK. No more, no more.  ORLANDO. Yes, I beseech your grace. I am not yet well breathed.  DUKE FREDERICK. How dost thou, Charles?  LE BEAU. He cannot speak, my lord.  DUKE FREDERICK. Bear him away.  [_Charles is carried off by Attendants._]  What is thy name, young man?  ORLANDO. Orlando, my liege, the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys.  DUKE FREDERICK. I would thou hadst been son to some man else. The world esteemed thy father honourable, But I did find him still mine enemy. Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed Hadst thou descended from another house. But fare thee well, thou art a gallant youth. I would thou hadst told me of another father.  [_Exeunt Duke Frederick, Le Beau and Lords._]  CELIA. Were I my father, coz, would I do this?  ORLANDO. I am more proud to be Sir Rowland’s son, His youngest son, and would not change that calling To be adopted heir to Frederick.  ROSALIND. My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul, And all the world was of my father’s mind. Had I before known this young man his son, I should have given him tears unto entreaties Ere he should thus have ventured.  CELIA. Gentle cousin, Let us go thank him and encourage him. My father’s rough and envious disposition Sticks me at heart.—Sir, you have well deserved. If you do keep your promises in love But justly, as you have exceeded promise, Your mistress shall be happy.  ROSALIND. Gentleman,  [_Giving him a chain from her neck_.]  Wear this for me—one out of suits with Fortune, That could give more but that her hand lacks means.— Shall we go, coz?  CELIA. Ay.—Fare you well, fair gentleman.  ORLANDO. Can I not say, I thank you? My better parts Are all thrown down, and that which here stands up Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.  ROSALIND. He calls us back. My pride fell with my fortunes. I’ll ask him what he would.—Did you call, sir?— Sir, you have wrestled well and overthrown More than your enemies.  CELIA. Will you go, coz?  ROSALIND. Have with you.—Fare you well.  [_Exeunt Rosalind and Celia._]  ORLANDO. What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue? I cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference. O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown. Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.  Enter Le Beau.  LE BEAU. Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you To leave this place. Albeit you have deserved High commendation, true applause, and love, Yet such is now the Duke’s condition That he misconsters all that you have done. The Duke is humorous; what he is indeed More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.  ORLANDO. I thank you, sir; and pray you tell me this: Which of the two was daughter of the Duke That here was at the wrestling?  LE BEAU. Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners, But yet indeed the smaller is his daughter. The other is daughter to the banished Duke, And here detained by her usurping uncle To keep his daughter company, whose loves Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters. But I can tell you that of late this Duke Hath ta’en displeasure ’gainst his gentle niece, Grounded upon no other argument But that the people praise her for her virtues And pity her for her good father’s sake; And, on my life, his malice ’gainst the lady Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well. Hereafter, in a better world than this, I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.  ORLANDO. I rest much bounden to you; fare you well!  [_Exit Le Beau._]  Thus must I from the smoke into the smother, From tyrant Duke unto a tyrant brother. But heavenly Rosalind!  [_Exit._]  SCENE III. A Room in the Palace  Enter Celia and Rosalind.  CELIA. Why, cousin, why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy! Not a word?  ROSALIND. Not one to throw at a dog.  CELIA. No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs. Throw some of them at me. Come, lame me with reasons.  ROSALIND. Then there were two cousins laid up, when the one should be lamed with reasons and the other mad without any.  CELIA. But is all this for your father?  ROSALIND. No, some of it is for my child’s father. O, how full of briers is this working-day world!  CELIA. They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in holiday foolery. If we walk not in the trodden paths, our very petticoats will catch them.  ROSALIND. I could shake them off my coat; these burs are in my heart.  CELIA. Hem them away.  ROSALIND. I would try, if I could cry “hem” and have him.  CELIA. Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.  ROSALIND. O, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself.  CELIA. O, a good wish upon you! You will try in time, in despite of a fall. But turning these jests out of service, let us talk in good earnest. Is it possible on such a sudden you should fall into so strong a liking with old Sir Rowland’s youngest son?  ROSALIND. The Duke my father loved his father dearly.  CELIA. Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly? By this kind of chase I should hate him, for my father hated his father dearly; yet I hate not Orlando.  ROSALIND. No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.  CELIA. Why should I not? Doth he not deserve well?  Enter Duke Frederick with Lords.  ROSALIND. Let me love him for that, and do you love him because I do.—Look, here comes the Duke.  CELIA. With his eyes full of anger.  DUKE FREDERICK. Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste, And get you from our court.  ROSALIND. Me, uncle?  DUKE FREDERICK. You, cousin. Within these ten days if that thou be’st found So near our public court as twenty miles, Thou diest for it.  ROSALIND. I do beseech your Grace, Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me. If with myself I hold intelligence, Or have acquaintance with mine own desires, If that I do not dream, or be not frantic— As I do trust I am not—then, dear uncle, Never so much as in a thought unborn Did I offend your Highness.  DUKE FREDERICK. Thus do all traitors. If their purgation did consist in words, They are as innocent as grace itself. Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.  ROSALIND. Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor. Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.  DUKE FREDERICK. Thou art thy father’s daughter, there’s enough.  ROSALIND. So was I when your highness took his dukedom; So was I when your highness banished him. Treason is not inherited, my lord, Or, if we did derive it from our friends, What’s that to me? My father was no traitor. Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much To think my poverty is treacherous.  CELIA. Dear sovereign, hear me speak.  DUKE FREDERICK. Ay, Celia, we stayed her for your sake, Else had she with her father ranged along.  CELIA. I did not then entreat to have her stay; It was your pleasure and your own remorse. I was too young that time to value her, But now I know her. If she be a traitor, Why, so am I. We still have slept together, Rose at an instant, learned, played, ate together, And wheresoe’er we went, like Juno’s swans, Still we went coupled and inseparable.  DUKE FREDERICK. She is too subtle for thee, and her smoothness, Her very silence, and her patience Speak to the people, and they pity her. Thou art a fool. She robs thee of thy name, And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous When she is gone. Then open not thy lips. Firm and irrevocable is my doom Which I have passed upon her. She is banished.  CELIA. Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege. I cannot live out of her company.  DUKE FREDERICK. You are a fool. You, niece, provide yourself. If you outstay the time, upon mine honour And in the greatness of my word, you die.  [_Exeunt Duke Frederick and Lords._]  CELIA. O my poor Rosalind, whither wilt thou go? Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine. I charge thee, be not thou more grieved than I am.  ROSALIND. I have more cause.  CELIA. Thou hast not, cousin. Prithee be cheerful. Know’st thou not the Duke Hath banished me, his daughter?  ROSALIND. That he hath not.  CELIA. No, hath not? Rosalind lacks then the love Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one. Shall we be sundered? Shall we part, sweet girl? No, let my father seek another heir. Therefore devise with me how we may fly, Whither to go, and what to bear with us, And do not seek to take your change upon you, To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out. For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale, Say what thou canst, I’ll go along with thee.  ROSALIND. Why, whither shall we go?  CELIA. To seek my uncle in the Forest of Arden.  ROSALIND. Alas, what danger will it be to us, Maids as we are, to travel forth so far? Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.  CELIA. I’ll put myself in poor and mean attire, And with a kind of umber smirch my face. The like do you; so shall we pass along And never stir assailants.  ROSALIND. Were it not better, Because that I am more than common tall, That I did suit me all points like a man? A gallant curtal-axe upon my thigh, A boar-spear in my hand, and in my heart Lie there what hidden woman’s fear there will, We’ll have a swashing and a martial outside, As many other mannish cowards have That do outface it with their semblances.  CELIA. What shall I call thee when thou art a man?  ROSALIND. I’ll have no worse a name than Jove’s own page, And therefore look you call me Ganymede. But what will you be called?  CELIA. Something that hath a reference to my state: No longer Celia, but Aliena.  ROSALIND. But, cousin, what if we assayed to steal The clownish fool out of your father’s court? Would he not be a comfort to our travel?  CELIA. He’ll go along o’er the wide world with me. Leave me alone to woo him. Let’s away, And get our jewels and our wealth together, Devise the fittest time and safest way To hide us from pursuit that will be made After my flight. Now go we in content To liberty, and not to banishment.  [_Exeunt._]
  ACT II  SCENE I. The Forest of Arden
Enter Duke Senior, Amiens and two or three Lords, dressed as foresters.  DUKE SENIOR. Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile, Hath not old custom made this life more sweet Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods More free from peril than the envious court? Here feel we not the penalty of Adam, The seasons’ difference, as the icy fang And churlish chiding of the winter’s wind, Which when it bites and blows upon my body Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say: “This is no flattery. These are counsellors That feelingly persuade me what I am.” Sweet are the uses of adversity, Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous, Wears yet a precious jewel in his head; And this our life, exempt from public haunt, Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks, Sermons in stones, and good in everything.  AMIENS. I would not change it. Happy is your grace, That can translate the stubbornness of fortune Into so quiet and so sweet a style.  DUKE SENIOR. Come, shall we go and kill us venison? And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools, Being native burghers of this desert city, Should in their own confines with forked heads Have their round haunches gored.  FIRST LORD. Indeed, my lord, The melancholy Jaques grieves at that, And in that kind swears you do more usurp Than doth your brother that hath banished you. Today my lord of Amiens and myself Did steal behind him as he lay along Under an oak, whose antique root peeps out Upon the brook that brawls along this wood; To the which place a poor sequestered stag, That from the hunter’s aim had ta’en a hurt, Did come to languish; and indeed, my lord, The wretched animal heaved forth such groans That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat Almost to bursting, and the big round tears Coursed one another down his innocent nose In piteous chase. And thus the hairy fool, Much marked of the melancholy Jaques, Stood on th’ extremest verge of the swift brook, Augmenting it with tears.  DUKE SENIOR. But what said Jaques? Did he not moralize this spectacle?  FIRST LORD. O yes, into a thousand similes. First, for his weeping into the needless stream: “Poor deer,” quoth he “thou mak’st a testament As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more To that which had too much.” Then, being there alone, Left and abandoned of his velvet friends: “’Tis right”; quoth he, “thus misery doth part The flux of company.” Anon a careless herd, Full of the pasture, jumps along by him And never stays to greet him. “Ay,” quoth Jaques, “Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens! ’Tis just the fashion. Wherefore do you look Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?” Thus most invectively he pierceth through The body of the country, city, court, Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we Are mere usurpers, tyrants, and what’s worse, To fright the animals and to kill them up In their assigned and native dwelling-place.  DUKE SENIOR. And did you leave him in this contemplation?  SECOND LORD. We did, my lord, weeping and commenting Upon the sobbing deer.  DUKE SENIOR. Show me the place. I love to cope him in these sullen fits, For then he’s full of matter.  FIRST LORD. I’ll bring you to him straight.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. A Room in the Palace  Enter Duke Frederick with Lords.  DUKE FREDERICK. Can it be possible that no man saw them? It cannot be! Some villains of my court Are of consent and sufferance in this.  FIRST LORD. I cannot hear of any that did see her. The ladies, her attendants of her chamber, Saw her abed, and in the morning early They found the bed untreasured of their mistress.  SECOND LORD. My lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft Your grace was wont to laugh, is also missing. Hesperia, the princess’ gentlewoman, Confesses that she secretly o’erheard Your daughter and her cousin much commend The parts and graces of the wrestler That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles; And she believes wherever they are gone That youth is surely in their company.  DUKE FREDERICK. Send to his brother; fetch that gallant hither. If he be absent, bring his brother to me. I’ll make him find him. Do this suddenly! And let not search and inquisition quail To bring again these foolish runaways.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. Before Oliver’s House  Enter Orlando and Adam, meeting.  ORLANDO. Who’s there?  ADAM. What, my young master? O my gentle master, O my sweet master, O you memory Of old Sir Rowland! Why, what make you here? Why are you virtuous? Why do people love you? And wherefore are you gentle, strong, and valiant? Why would you be so fond to overcome The bonny prizer of the humorous Duke? Your praise is come too swiftly home before you. Know you not, master, to some kind of men Their graces serve them but as enemies? No more do yours. Your virtues, gentle master, Are sanctified and holy traitors to you. O, what a world is this, when what is comely Envenoms him that bears it!  ORLANDO. Why, what’s the matter?  ADAM. O unhappy youth, Come not within these doors! Within this roof The enemy of all your graces lives. Your brother—no, no brother, yet the son— Yet not the son; I will not call him son— Of him I was about to call his father, Hath heard your praises, and this night he means To burn the lodging where you use to lie, And you within it. If he fail of that, He will have other means to cut you off; I overheard him and his practices. This is no place; this house is but a butchery. Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.  ORLANDO. Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?  ADAM. No matter whither, so you come not here.  ORLANDO. What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food, Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce A thievish living on the common road? This I must do, or know not what to do. Yet this I will not do, do how I can. I rather will subject me to the malice Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.  ADAM. But do not so. I have five hundred crowns, The thrifty hire I saved under your father, Which I did store to be my foster-nurse, When service should in my old limbs lie lame, And unregarded age in corners thrown. Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed, Yea, providently caters for the sparrow, Be comfort to my age. Here is the gold. All this I give you. Let me be your servant. Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty, For in my youth I never did apply Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood, Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo The means of weakness and debility. Therefore my age is as a lusty winter, Frosty but kindly. Let me go with you. I’ll do the service of a younger man In all your business and necessities.  ORLANDO. O good old man, how well in thee appears The constant service of the antique world, When service sweat for duty, not for meed. Thou art not for the fashion of these times, Where none will sweat but for promotion, And having that do choke their service up Even with the having. It is not so with thee. But, poor old man, thou prun’st a rotten tree, That cannot so much as a blossom yield In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry. But come thy ways, we’ll go along together, And ere we have thy youthful wages spent We’ll light upon some settled low content.  ADAM. Master, go on and I will follow thee To the last gasp with truth and loyalty. From seventeen years till now almost fourscore Here lived I, but now live here no more. At seventeen years many their fortunes seek, But at fourscore it is too late a week. Yet fortune cannot recompense me better Than to die well and not my master’s debtor.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IV. The Forest of Arden  Enter Rosalind as Ganymede, Celia as Aliena, and Touchstone.  ROSALIND. O Jupiter, how weary are my spirits!  TOUCHSTONE. I care not for my spirits, if my legs were not weary.  ROSALIND. I could find in my heart to disgrace my man’s apparel, and to cry like a woman, but I must comfort the weaker vessel, as doublet and hose ought to show itself courageous to petticoat. Therefore, courage, good Aliena.  CELIA. I pray you bear with me, I cannot go no further.  TOUCHSTONE. For my part, I had rather bear with you than bear you. Yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you, for I think you have no money in your purse.  ROSALIND. Well, this is the forest of Arden.  TOUCHSTONE. Ay, now am I in Arden, the more fool I! When I was at home I was in a better place, but travellers must be content.  Enter Corin and Silvius.  ROSALIND. Ay, be so, good Touchstone. Look you, who comes here? A young man and an old in solemn talk.  CORIN. That is the way to make her scorn you still.  SILVIUS. O Corin, that thou knew’st how I do love her!  CORIN. I partly guess, for I have loved ere now.  SILVIUS. No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess, Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover As ever sighed upon a midnight pillow. But if thy love were ever like to mine— As sure I think did never man love so— How many actions most ridiculous Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?  CORIN. Into a thousand that I have forgotten.  SILVIUS. O, thou didst then never love so heartily! If thou rememb’rest not the slightest folly That ever love did make thee run into, Thou hast not loved. Or if thou hast not sat as I do now, Wearing thy hearer in thy mistress’ praise, Thou hast not loved. Or if thou hast not broke from company Abruptly, as my passion now makes me, Thou hast not loved. O Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe!  [_Exit Silvius._]  ROSALIND. Alas, poor shepherd, searching of thy wound, I have by hard adventure found mine own.  TOUCHSTONE. And I mine. I remember when I was in love I broke my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for coming a-night to Jane Smile; and I remember the kissing of her batlet, and the cow’s dugs that her pretty chopped hands had milked; and I remember the wooing of a peascod instead of her, from whom I took two cods, and, giving her them again, said with weeping tears, “Wear these for my sake.” We that are true lovers run into strange capers. But as all is mortal in nature, so is all nature in love mortal in folly.  ROSALIND. Thou speak’st wiser than thou art ware of.  TOUCHSTONE. Nay, I shall ne’er be ware of mine own wit till I break my shins against it.  ROSALIND. Jove, Jove, this shepherd’s passion Is much upon my fashion.  TOUCHSTONE. And mine, but it grows something stale with me.  CELIA. I pray you, one of you question yond man If he for gold will give us any food. I faint almost to death.  TOUCHSTONE. Holla, you clown!  ROSALIND. Peace, fool, he’s not thy kinsman.  CORIN. Who calls?  TOUCHSTONE. Your betters, sir.  CORIN. Else are they very wretched.  ROSALIND. Peace, I say.—Good even to you, friend.  CORIN. And to you, gentle sir, and to you all.  ROSALIND. I prithee, shepherd, if that love or gold Can in this desert place buy entertainment, Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed. Here’s a young maid with travel much oppressed, And faints for succour.  CORIN. Fair sir, I pity her And wish, for her sake more than for mine own, My fortunes were more able to relieve her. But I am shepherd to another man And do not shear the fleeces that I graze. My master is of churlish disposition And little recks to find the way to heaven By doing deeds of hospitality. Besides, his cote, his flocks, and bounds of feed Are now on sale, and at our sheepcote now, By reason of his absence, there is nothing That you will feed on. But what is, come see, And in my voice most welcome shall you be.  ROSALIND. What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?  CORIN. That young swain that you saw here but erewhile, That little cares for buying anything.  ROSALIND. I pray thee, if it stand with honesty, Buy thou the cottage, pasture, and the flock, And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.  CELIA. And we will mend thy wages. I like this place, And willingly could waste my time in it.  CORIN. Assuredly the thing is to be sold. Go with me. If you like upon report The soil, the profit, and this kind of life, I will your very faithful feeder be, And buy it with your gold right suddenly.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE V. Another part of the Forest  Enter Amiens, Jaques and others.  AMIENS. [_Sings_.]          Under the greenwood tree,         Who loves to lie with me         And turn his merry note         Unto the sweet bird’s throat,     Come hither, come hither, come hither!         Here shall he see         No enemy     But winter and rough weather.  JAQUES. More, more, I prithee, more.  AMIENS. It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques.  JAQUES. I thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suck melancholy out of a song as a weasel sucks eggs. More, I prithee, more.  AMIENS. My voice is ragged. I know I cannot please you.  JAQUES. I do not desire you to please me; I do desire you to sing. Come, more, another _stanzo_. Call you ’em _stanzos?_  AMIENS. What you will, Monsieur Jaques.  JAQUES. Nay, I care not for their names. They owe me nothing. Will you sing?  AMIENS. More at your request than to please myself.  JAQUES. Well then, if ever I thank any man, I’ll thank you; but that they call compliment is like th’ encounter of two dog-apes. And when a man thanks me heartily, methinks I have given him a penny and he renders me the beggarly thanks. Come, sing; and you that will not, hold your tongues.  AMIENS. Well, I’ll end the song.—Sirs, cover the while. The Duke will drink under this tree; he hath been all this day to look you.  JAQUES. And I have been all this day to avoid him. He is too disputable for my company. I think of as many matters as he, but I give heaven thanks and make no boast of them. Come, warble, come.  AMIENS. [_Sings_.]          Who doth ambition shun         And loves to live i’ th’ sun,         Seeking the food he eats         And pleased with what he gets,     Come hither, come hither, come hither.         Here shall he see         No enemy     But winter and rough weather.  JAQUES. I’ll give you a verse to this note that I made yesterday in despite of my invention.  AMIENS. And I’ll sing it.  JAQUES. Thus it goes:          If it do come to pass         That any man turn ass,         Leaving his wealth and ease         A stubborn will to please,     Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame;         Here shall he see         Gross fools as he,     An if he will come to me.  AMIENS. What’s that “ducdame?”  JAQUES. ’Tis a Greek invocation to call fools into a circle. I’ll go sleep if I can; if I cannot, I’ll rail against all the first-born of Egypt.  AMIENS. And I’ll go seek the Duke; his banquet is prepared.  [_Exeunt severally._]  SCENE VI. Another part of the Forest  Enter Orlando and Adam.  ADAM. Dear master, I can go no further. O, I die for food! Here lie I down and measure out my grave. Farewell, kind master.  ORLANDO. Why, how now, Adam? No greater heart in thee? Live a little, comfort a little, cheer thyself a little. If this uncouth forest yield anything savage, I will either be food for it or bring it for food to thee. Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers. For my sake, be comfortable. Hold death awhile at the arm’s end. I will here be with thee presently, and if I bring thee not something to eat, I’ll give thee leave to die. But if thou diest before I come, thou art a mocker of my labour. Well said, thou look’st cheerly, and I’ll be with thee quickly. Yet thou liest in the bleak air. Come, I will bear thee to some shelter and thou shalt not die for lack of a dinner if there live anything in this desert. Cheerly, good Adam!  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE VII. Another part of the Forest  Enter Duke Senior, Amiens and Lords as outlaws.  DUKE SENIOR. I think he be transformed into a beast, For I can nowhere find him like a man.  FIRST LORD. My lord, he is but even now gone hence; Here was he merry, hearing of a song.  DUKE SENIOR. If he, compact of jars, grow musical, We shall have shortly discord in the spheres. Go seek him, tell him I would speak with him.  Enter Jaques.  FIRST LORD. He saves my labour by his own approach.  DUKE SENIOR. Why, how now, monsieur? What a life is this That your poor friends must woo your company? What, you look merrily.  JAQUES. A fool, a fool! I met a fool i’ th’ forest, A motley fool. A miserable world! As I do live by food, I met a fool, Who laid him down and basked him in the sun, And railed on Lady Fortune in good terms, In good set terms, and yet a motley fool. “Good morrow, fool,” quoth I. “No, sir,” quoth he, “Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune.” And then he drew a dial from his poke, And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye, Says very wisely, “It is ten o’clock. Thus we may see,” quoth he, “how the world wags. ’Tis but an hour ago since it was nine, And after one hour more ’twill be eleven. And so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe, And then from hour to hour we rot and rot, And thereby hangs a tale.” When I did hear The motley fool thus moral on the time, My lungs began to crow like chanticleer, That fools should be so deep-contemplative, And I did laugh sans intermission An hour by his dial. O noble fool! A worthy fool! Motley’s the only wear.  DUKE SENIOR. What fool is this?  JAQUES. O worthy fool!—One that hath been a courtier, And says if ladies be but young and fair, They have the gift to know it. And in his brain, Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit After a voyage, he hath strange places crammed With observation, the which he vents In mangled forms. O that I were a fool! I am ambitious for a motley coat.  DUKE SENIOR. Thou shalt have one.  JAQUES. It is my only suit, Provided that you weed your better judgements Of all opinion that grows rank in them That I am wise. I must have liberty Withal, as large a charter as the wind, To blow on whom I please, for so fools have. And they that are most galled with my folly, They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so? The “why” is plain as way to parish church. He that a fool doth very wisely hit Doth very foolishly, although he smart, Not to seem senseless of the bob. If not, The wise man’s folly is anatomized Even by the squandering glances of the fool. Invest me in my motley. Give me leave To speak my mind, and I will through and through Cleanse the foul body of th’ infected world, If they will patiently receive my medicine.  DUKE SENIOR. Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.  JAQUES. What, for a counter, would I do but good?  DUKE SENIOR. Most mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin; For thou thyself hast been a libertine, As sensual as the brutish sting itself, And all th’ embossed sores and headed evils That thou with license of free foot hast caught Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.  JAQUES. Why, who cries out on pride That can therein tax any private party? Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea Till that the weary very means do ebb? What woman in the city do I name When that I say the city-woman bears The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders? Who can come in and say that I mean her, When such a one as she, such is her neighbour? Or what is he of basest function That says his bravery is not on my cost, Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits His folly to the mettle of my speech? There then. How then, what then? Let me see wherein My tongue hath wronged him. If it do him right, Then he hath wronged himself. If he be free, Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies Unclaimed of any man. But who comes here?  Enter Orlando with sword drawn.  ORLANDO. Forbear, and eat no more.  JAQUES. Why, I have eat none yet.  ORLANDO. Nor shalt not till necessity be served.  JAQUES. Of what kind should this cock come of?  DUKE SENIOR. Art thou thus boldened, man, by thy distress? Or else a rude despiser of good manners, That in civility thou seem’st so empty?  ORLANDO. You touched my vein at first. The thorny point Of bare distress hath ta’en from me the show Of smooth civility; yet am I inland bred And know some nurture. But forbear, I say! He dies that touches any of this fruit Till I and my affairs are answered.  JAQUES. An you will not be answered with reason, I must die.  DUKE SENIOR. What would you have? Your gentleness shall force More than your force move us to gentleness.  ORLANDO. I almost die for food, and let me have it.  DUKE SENIOR. Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.  ORLANDO. Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you. I thought that all things had been savage here And therefore put I on the countenance Of stern commandment. But whate’er you are That in this desert inaccessible, Under the shade of melancholy boughs, Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time, If ever you have looked on better days, If ever been where bells have knolled to church, If ever sat at any good man’s feast, If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear, And know what ’tis to pity and be pitied, Let gentleness my strong enforcement be, In the which hope I blush and hide my sword.  DUKE SENIOR. True is it that we have seen better days, And have with holy bell been knolled to church, And sat at good men’s feasts, and wiped our eyes Of drops that sacred pity hath engendered. And therefore sit you down in gentleness, And take upon command what help we have That to your wanting may be ministered.  ORLANDO. Then but forbear your food a little while, Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn, And give it food. There is an old poor man Who after me hath many a weary step Limped in pure love. Till he be first sufficed, Oppressed with two weak evils, age and hunger, I will not touch a bit.  DUKE SENIOR. Go find him out, And we will nothing waste till you return.  ORLANDO. I thank ye, and be blest for your good comfort.  [_Exit._]  DUKE SENIOR. Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy. This wide and universal theatre Presents more woeful pageants than the scene Wherein we play in.  JAQUES. All the world’s a stage, And all the men and women merely players; They have their exits and their entrances, And one man in his time plays many parts, His acts being seven ages. At first the infant, Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms; Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel And shining morning face, creeping like snail Unwillingly to school. And then the lover, Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad Made to his mistress’ eyebrow. Then a soldier, Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard, Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel, Seeking the bubble reputation Even in the cannon’s mouth. And then the justice, In fair round belly with good capon lined, With eyes severe and beard of formal cut, Full of wise saws and modern instances; And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts Into the lean and slippered pantaloon, With spectacles on nose and pouch on side, His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice, Turning again toward childish treble, pipes And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all, That ends this strange eventful history, Is second childishness and mere oblivion, Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.  Enter Orlando bearing Adam.  DUKE SENIOR. Welcome. Set down your venerable burden, And let him feed.  ORLANDO. I thank you most for him.  ADAM. So had you need; I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.  DUKE SENIOR. Welcome, fall to. I will not trouble you As yet to question you about your fortunes. Give us some music, and good cousin, sing.  SONG.
AMIENS. (_Sings_.)         Blow, blow, thou winter wind,         Thou art not so unkind             As man’s ingratitude.         Thy tooth is not so keen,         Because thou art not seen,             Although thy breath be rude. Heigh-ho, sing heigh-ho, unto the green holly. Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly.         Then, heigh-ho, the holly!             This life is most jolly.           Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,         That dost not bite so nigh             As benefits forgot.         Though thou the waters warp,         Thy sting is not so sharp             As friend remembered not. Heigh-ho, sing heigh-ho, unto the green holly. Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly.         Then, heigh-ho, the holly!             This life is most jolly.  DUKE SENIOR. If that you were the good Sir Rowland’s son, As you have whispered faithfully you were, And as mine eye doth his effigies witness Most truly limned and living in your face, Be truly welcome hither. I am the Duke That loved your father. The residue of your fortune Go to my cave and tell me.—Good old man, Thou art right welcome as thy master is. Support him by the arm. [_To Orlando_.] Give me your hand, And let me all your fortunes understand.  [_Exeunt._]
  ACT III  SCENE I. A Room in the Palace
Enter Duke Frederick, Lords and Oliver.  DUKE FREDERICK. Not see him since? Sir, sir, that cannot be. But were I not the better part made mercy, I should not seek an absent argument Of my revenge, thou present. But look to it: Find out thy brother wheresoe’er he is. Seek him with candle. Bring him dead or living Within this twelvemonth, or turn thou no more To seek a living in our territory. Thy lands, and all things that thou dost call thine Worth seizure, do we seize into our hands, Till thou canst quit thee by thy brother’s mouth Of what we think against thee.  OLIVER. O that your highness knew my heart in this: I never loved my brother in my life.  DUKE FREDERICK. More villain thou. Well, push him out of doors, And let my officers of such a nature Make an extent upon his house and lands. Do this expediently, and turn him going.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. The Forest of Arden  Enter Orlando with a paper.  ORLANDO. Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love.      And thou, thrice-crowned queen of night, survey With thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above,      Thy huntress’ name that my full life doth sway. O Rosalind, these trees shall be my books,      And in their barks my thoughts I’ll character, That every eye which in this forest looks      Shall see thy virtue witnessed everywhere. Run, run, Orlando, carve on every tree The fair, the chaste, and unexpressive she.  [_Exit._]  Enter Corin and Touchstone.  CORIN. And how like you this shepherd’s life, Master Touchstone?  TOUCHSTONE. Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good life; but in respect that it is a shepherd’s life, it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I like it very well; but in respect that it is private, it is a very vile life. Now in respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As it is a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well; but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?  CORIN. No more but that I know the more one sickens, the worse at ease he is; and that he that wants money, means, and content is without three good friends; that the property of rain is to wet, and fire to burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep; and that a great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred.  TOUCHSTONE. Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in court, shepherd?  CORIN. No, truly.  TOUCHSTONE. Then thou art damned.  CORIN. Nay, I hope.  TOUCHSTONE. Truly, thou art damned, like an ill-roasted egg, all on one side.  CORIN. For not being at court? Your reason.  TOUCHSTONE. Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never saw’st good manners; if thou never saw’st good manners, then thy manners must be wicked, and wickedness is sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous state, shepherd.  CORIN. Not a whit, Touchstone. Those that are good manners at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the behaviour of the country is most mockable at the court. You told me you salute not at the court but you kiss your hands. That courtesy would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds.  TOUCHSTONE. Instance, briefly. Come, instance.  CORIN. Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their fells, you know, are greasy.  TOUCHSTONE. Why, do not your courtier’s hands sweat? And is not the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say. Come.  CORIN. Besides, our hands are hard.  TOUCHSTONE. Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again. A more sounder instance, come.  CORIN. And they are often tarred over with the surgery of our sheep; and would you have us kiss tar? The courtier’s hands are perfumed with civet.  TOUCHSTONE. Most shallow man! Thou worm’s meat in respect of a good piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise and perpend. Civet is of a baser birth than tar, the very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd.  CORIN. You have too courtly a wit for me. I’ll rest.  TOUCHSTONE. Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee, shallow man! God make incision in thee, thou art raw.  CORIN. Sir, I am a true labourer. I earn that I eat, get that I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man’s happiness, glad of other men’s good, content with my harm; and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck.  TOUCHSTONE. That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes and the rams together and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a bell-wether and to betray a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram, out of all reasonable match. If thou be’st not damned for this, the devil himself will have no shepherds. I cannot see else how thou shouldst ’scape.  Enter Rosalind as Ganymede.  CORIN. Here comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistress’s brother.  ROSALIND. [_Reads_.]          _From the east to western Inde          No jewel is like Rosalind.          Her worth being mounted on the wind,          Through all the world bears Rosalind.          All the pictures fairest lined          Are but black to Rosalind.          Let no face be kept in mind          But the fair of Rosalind._  TOUCHSTONE. I’ll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners and suppers and sleeping hours excepted. It is the right butter-women’s rank to market.  ROSALIND. Out, fool!  TOUCHSTONE.          For a taste:          If a hart do lack a hind,          Let him seek out Rosalind.          If the cat will after kind,          So be sure will Rosalind.          Winter garments must be lined,          So must slender Rosalind.          They that reap must sheaf and bind,          Then to cart with Rosalind.          Sweetest nut hath sourest rind,          Such a nut is Rosalind.          He that sweetest rose will find          Must find love’s prick, and Rosalind. This is the very false gallop of verses. Why do you infect yourself with them?  ROSALIND. Peace, you dull fool, I found them on a tree.  TOUCHSTONE. Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.  ROSALIND. I’ll graft it with you, and then I shall graft it with a medlar. Then it will be the earliest fruit i’ th’ country, for you’ll be rotten ere you be half ripe, and that’s the right virtue of the medlar.  TOUCHSTONE. You have said, but whether wisely or no, let the forest judge.  Enter Celia as Aliena, reading a paper.  ROSALIND. Peace, here comes my sister, reading. Stand aside.  CELIA. [_Reads_.]             _Why should this a desert be?                 For it is unpeopled? No!             Tongues I’ll hang on every tree                 That shall civil sayings show.             Some, how brief the life of man                 Runs his erring pilgrimage,             That the streching of a span                 Buckles in his sum of age;             Some, of violated vows                 ’Twixt the souls of friend and friend.             But upon the fairest boughs,                 Or at every sentence’ end,             Will I “Rosalinda” write,                 Teaching all that read to know             The quintessence of every sprite                 Heaven would in little show.             Therefore heaven nature charged                 That one body should be filled             With all graces wide-enlarged.                 Nature presently distilled             Helen’s cheek, but not her heart,                 Cleopatra’s majesty;             Atalanta’s better part,                 Sad Lucretia’s modesty.             Thus Rosalind of many parts                 By heavenly synod was devised,             Of many faces, eyes, and hearts                 To have the touches dearest prized.             Heaven would that she these gifts should have,                 And I to live and die her slave._  ROSALIND. O most gentle Jupiter, what tedious homily of love have you wearied your parishioners withal, and never cried “Have patience, good people!”  CELIA. How now! Back, friends. Shepherd, go off a little. Go with him, sirrah.  TOUCHSTONE. Come, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat, though not with bag and baggage, yet with scrip and scrippage.  [_Exeunt Corin and Touchstone._]  CELIA. Didst thou hear these verses?  ROSALIND. O yes, I heard them all, and more too, for some of them had in them more feet than the verses would bear.  CELIA. That’s no matter. The feet might bear the verses.  ROSALIND. Ay, but the feet were lame and could not bear themselves without the verse, and therefore stood lamely in the verse.  CELIA. But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be hanged and carved upon these trees?  ROSALIND. I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you came; for look here what I found on a palm-tree. I was never so berhymed since Pythagoras’ time that I was an Irish rat, which I can hardly remember.  CELIA. Trow you who hath done this?  ROSALIND. Is it a man?  CELIA. And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck. Change you colour?  ROSALIND. I prithee, who?  CELIA. O Lord, Lord, it is a hard matter for friends to meet; but mountains may be removed with earthquakes and so encounter.  ROSALIND. Nay, but who is it?  CELIA. Is it possible?  ROSALIND. Nay, I prithee now, with most petitionary vehemence, tell me who it is.  CELIA. O wonderful, wonderful, most wonderful wonderful, and yet again wonderful, and after that, out of all whooping!  ROSALIND. Good my complexion! Dost thou think, though I am caparisoned like a man, I have a doublet and hose in my disposition? One inch of delay more is a South Sea of discovery. I prithee tell me who is it quickly, and speak apace. I would thou couldst stammer, that thou mightst pour this concealed man out of thy mouth, as wine comes out of narrow-mouthed bottle—either too much at once or none at all. I prithee take the cork out of thy mouth that I may drink thy tidings.  CELIA. So you may put a man in your belly.  ROSALIND. Is he of God’s making? What manner of man? Is his head worth a hat, or his chin worth a beard?  CELIA. Nay, he hath but a little beard.  ROSALIND. Why, God will send more if the man will be thankful. Let me stay the growth of his beard, if thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin.  CELIA. It is young Orlando, that tripped up the wrestler’s heels and your heart both in an instant.  ROSALIND. Nay, but the devil take mocking! Speak sad brow and true maid.  CELIA. I’ faith, coz, ’tis he.  ROSALIND. Orlando?  CELIA. Orlando.  ROSALIND. Alas the day, what shall I do with my doublet and hose? What did he when thou saw’st him? What said he? How looked he? Wherein went he? What makes he here? Did he ask for me? Where remains he? How parted he with thee? And when shalt thou see him again? Answer me in one word.  CELIA. You must borrow me Gargantua’s mouth first. ’Tis a word too great for any mouth of this age’s size. To say ay and no to these particulars is more than to answer in a catechism.  ROSALIND. But doth he know that I am in this forest and in man’s apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled?  CELIA. It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the propositions of a lover. But take a taste of my finding him, and relish it with good observance. I found him under a tree, like a dropped acorn.  ROSALIND. It may well be called Jove’s tree when it drops forth such fruit.  CELIA. Give me audience, good madam.  ROSALIND. Proceed.  CELIA. There lay he, stretched along like a wounded knight.  ROSALIND. Though it be pity to see such a sight, it well becomes the ground.  CELIA. Cry “holla!” to thy tongue, I prithee. It curvets unseasonably. He was furnished like a hunter.  ROSALIND. O, ominous! He comes to kill my heart.  CELIA. I would sing my song without a burden. Thou bring’st me out of tune.  ROSALIND. Do you not know I am a woman? When I think, I must speak. Sweet, say on.  Enter Orlando and Jaques.  CELIA. You bring me out. Soft, comes he not here?  ROSALIND. ’Tis he! Slink by, and note him.  [_Rosalind and Celia step aside._]  JAQUES. I thank you for your company but, good faith, I had as lief have been myself alone.  ORLANDO. And so had I, but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you too for your society.  JAQUES. God be wi’ you, let’s meet as little as we can.  ORLANDO. I do desire we may be better strangers.  JAQUES. I pray you, mar no more trees with writing love songs in their barks.  ORLANDO. I pray you, mar no more of my verses with reading them ill-favouredly.  JAQUES. Rosalind is your love’s name?  ORLANDO. Yes, just.  JAQUES. I do not like her name.  ORLANDO. There was no thought of pleasing you when she was christened.  JAQUES. What stature is she of?  ORLANDO. Just as high as my heart.  JAQUES. You are full of pretty answers. Have you not been acquainted with goldsmiths’ wives, and conned them out of rings?  ORLANDO. Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth, from whence you have studied your questions.  JAQUES. You have a nimble wit. I think ’twas made of Atalanta’s heels. Will you sit down with me? And we two will rail against our mistress the world and all our misery.  ORLANDO. I will chide no breather in the world but myself, against whom I know most faults.  JAQUES. The worst fault you have is to be in love.  ORLANDO. ’Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue. I am weary of you.  JAQUES. By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found you.  ORLANDO. He is drowned in the brook. Look but in, and you shall see him.  JAQUES. There I shall see mine own figure.  ORLANDO. Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.  JAQUES. I’ll tarry no longer with you. Farewell, good Signior Love.  ORLANDO. I am glad of your departure. Adieu, good Monsieur Melancholy.  [_Exit Jaques.—Celia and Rosalind come forward._]  ROSALIND. I will speak to him like a saucy lackey, and under that habit play the knave with him. Do you hear, forester?  ORLANDO. Very well. What would you?  ROSALIND. I pray you, what is’t o’clock?  ORLANDO. You should ask me what time o’ day. There’s no clock in the forest.  ROSALIND. Then there is no true lover in the forest, else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock.  ORLANDO. And why not the swift foot of time? Had not that been as proper?  ROSALIND. By no means, sir. Time travels in divers paces with divers persons. I’ll tell you who time ambles withal, who time trots withal, who time gallops withal, and who he stands still withal.  ORLANDO. I prithee, who doth he trot withal?  ROSALIND. Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and the day it is solemnized. If the interim be but a se’nnight, time’s pace is so hard that it seems the length of seven year.  ORLANDO. Who ambles time withal?  ROSALIND. With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that hath not the gout; for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain; the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning, the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury. These time ambles withal.  ORLANDO. Who doth he gallop withal?  ROSALIND. With a thief to the gallows; for though he go as softly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.  ORLANDO. Who stays it still withal?  ROSALIND. With lawyers in the vacation; for they sleep between term and term, and then they perceive not how time moves.  ORLANDO. Where dwell you, pretty youth?  ROSALIND. With this shepherdess, my sister, here in the skirts of the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.  ORLANDO. Are you native of this place?  ROSALIND. As the coney that you see dwell where she is kindled.  ORLANDO. Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a dwelling.  ROSALIND. I have been told so of many. But indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was in his youth an inland man, one that knew courtship too well, for there he fell in love. I have heard him read many lectures against it, and I thank God I am not a woman, to be touched with so many giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their whole sex withal.  ORLANDO. Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of women?  ROSALIND. There were none principal. They were all like one another as halfpence are, every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.  ORLANDO. I prithee recount some of them.  ROSALIND. No. I will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick. There is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving “Rosalind” on their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles; all, forsooth, deifying the name of Rosalind. If I could meet that fancy-monger, I would give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him.  ORLANDO. I am he that is so love-shaked. I pray you tell me your remedy.  ROSALIND. There is none of my uncle’s marks upon you. He taught me how to know a man in love, in which cage of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.  ORLANDO. What were his marks?  ROSALIND. A lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken, which you have not; an unquestionable spirit, which you have not; a beard neglected, which you have not—but I pardon you for that, for simply your having in beard is a younger brother’s revenue. Then your hose should be ungartered, your bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe untied, and everything about you demonstrating a careless desolation. But you are no such man. You are rather point-device in your accoutrements, as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.  ORLANDO. Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.  ROSALIND. Me believe it? You may as soon make her that you love believe it, which I warrant she is apter to do than to confess she does. That is one of the points in the which women still give the lie to their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind is so admired?  ORLANDO. I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.  ROSALIND. But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?  ORLANDO. Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.  ROSALIND. Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do; and the reason why they are not so punished and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.  ORLANDO. Did you ever cure any so?  ROSALIND. Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me his love, his mistress, and I set him every day to woo me; at which time would I, being but a moonish youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow, inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles; for every passion something and for no passion truly anything, as boys and women are for the most part cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor from his mad humour of love to a living humour of madness, which was to forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a nook merely monastic. And thus I cured him, and this way will I take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep’s heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in ’t.  ORLANDO. I would not be cured, youth.  ROSALIND. I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind and come every day to my cote and woo me.  ORLANDO. Now, by the faith of my love, I will. Tell me where it is.  ROSALIND. Go with me to it, and I’ll show it you; and by the way you shall tell me where in the forest you live. Will you go?  ORLANDO. With all my heart, good youth.  ROSALIND. Nay, you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you go?  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. Another part of the Forest  Enter Touchstone and Audrey; Jaques at a distance observing them.  TOUCHSTONE. Come apace, good Audrey. I will fetch up your goats, Audrey. And how, Audrey? Am I the man yet? Doth my simple feature content you?  AUDREY. Your features, Lord warrant us! What features?  TOUCHSTONE. I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths.  JAQUES. [_Aside_.] O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove in a thatched house!  TOUCHSTONE. When a man’s verses cannot be understood, nor a man’s good wit seconded with the forward child, understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room. Truly, I would the gods had made thee poetical.  AUDREY. I do not know what “poetical” is. Is it honest in deed and word? Is it a true thing?  TOUCHSTONE. No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most feigning, and lovers are given to poetry, and what they swear in poetry may be said, as lovers, they do feign.  AUDREY. Do you wish, then, that the gods had made me poetical?  TOUCHSTONE. I do, truly, for thou swear’st to me thou art honest. Now if thou wert a poet, I might have some hope thou didst feign.  AUDREY. Would you not have me honest?  TOUCHSTONE. No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favoured; for honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.  JAQUES. [_Aside_.] A material fool!  AUDREY. Well, I am not fair, and therefore I pray the gods make me honest.  TOUCHSTONE. Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were to put good meat into an unclean dish.  AUDREY. I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.  TOUCHSTONE. Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness; sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may be, I will marry thee. And to that end I have been with Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar of the next village, who hath promised to meet me in this place of the forest and to couple us.  JAQUES. [_Aside_.] I would fain see this meeting.  AUDREY. Well, the gods give us joy!  TOUCHSTONE. Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart, stagger in this attempt, for here we have no temple but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But what though? Courage! As horns are odious, they are necessary. It is said, “Many a man knows no end of his goods.” Right. Many a man has good horns and knows no end of them. Well, that is the dowry of his wife; ’tis none of his own getting. Horns? Even so. Poor men alone? No, no, the noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man therefore blessed? No. As a walled town is more worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare brow of a bachelor. And by how much defence is better than no skill, by so much is horn more precious than to want.  Enter Sir Oliver Martext.  Here comes Sir Oliver. Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met. Will you dispatch us here under this tree, or shall we go with you to your chapel?  MARTEXT. Is there none here to give the woman?  TOUCHSTONE. I will not take her on gift of any man.  MARTEXT. Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.  JAQUES. [_Coming forward_.] Proceed, proceed. I’ll give her.  TOUCHSTONE. Good even, good Master What-ye-call’t, how do you, sir? You are very well met. God ’ild you for your last company. I am very glad to see you. Even a toy in hand here, sir. Nay, pray be covered.  JAQUES. Will you be married, motley?  TOUCHSTONE. As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb, and the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and as pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.  JAQUES. And will you, being a man of your breeding, be married under a bush like a beggar? Get you to church, and have a good priest that can tell you what marriage is. This fellow will but join you together as they join wainscot; then one of you will prove a shrunk panel, and like green timber, warp, warp.  TOUCHSTONE. [_Aside_.] I am not in the mind but I were better to be married of him than of another, for he is not like to marry me well, and not being well married, it will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife.  JAQUES. Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.  TOUCHSTONE. Come, sweet Audrey. We must be married, or we must live in bawdry. Farewell, good Master Oliver. Not              _O sweet Oliver,              O brave Oliver,          Leave me not behind thee._ But              _Wind away,—              Begone, I say,          I will not to wedding with thee._  [_Exeunt Touchstone, Audrey and Jaques._]  MARTEXT. ’Tis no matter. Ne’er a fantastical knave of them all shall flout me out of my calling.  [_Exit._]  SCENE IV. Another part of the Forest. Before a Cottage  Enter Rosalind and Celia.  ROSALIND. Never talk to me, I will weep.  CELIA. Do, I prithee, but yet have the grace to consider that tears do not become a man.  ROSALIND. But have I not cause to weep?  CELIA. As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.  ROSALIND. His very hair is of the dissembling colour.  CELIA. Something browner than Judas’s. Marry, his kisses are Judas’s own children.  ROSALIND. I’ faith, his hair is of a good colour.  CELIA. An excellent colour. Your chestnut was ever the only colour.  ROSALIND. And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread.  CELIA. He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana. A nun of winter’s sisterhood kisses not more religiously; the very ice of chastity is in them.  ROSALIND. But why did he swear he would come this morning, and comes not?  CELIA. Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.  ROSALIND. Do you think so?  CELIA. Yes. I think he is not a pick-purse nor a horse-stealer, but for his verity in love, I do think him as concave as a covered goblet or a worm-eaten nut.  ROSALIND. Not true in love?  CELIA. Yes, when he is in, but I think he is not in.  ROSALIND. You have heard him swear downright he was.  CELIA. “Was” is not “is”. Besides, the oath of a lover is no stronger than the word of a tapster. They are both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends here in the forest on the Duke your father.  ROSALIND. I met the Duke yesterday, and had much question with him. He asked me of what parentage I was. I told him, of as good as he, so he laughed and let me go. But what talk we of fathers when there is such a man as Orlando?  CELIA. O, that’s a brave man! He writes brave verses, speaks brave words, swears brave oaths, and breaks them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of his lover, as a puny tilter, that spurs his horse but on one side, breaks his staff like a noble goose. But all’s brave that youth mounts and folly guides. Who comes here?  Enter Corin.  CORIN. Mistress and master, you have oft enquired After the shepherd that complained of love, Who you saw sitting by me on the turf, Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess That was his mistress.  CELIA. Well, and what of him?  CORIN. If you will see a pageant truly played Between the pale complexion of true love And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain, Go hence a little, and I shall conduct you, If you will mark it.  ROSALIND. O, come, let us remove. The sight of lovers feedeth those in love. Bring us to this sight, and you shall say I’ll prove a busy actor in their play.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE V. Another part of the Forest  Enter Silvius and Phoebe.  SILVIUS. Sweet Phoebe, do not scorn me, do not, Phoebe. Say that you love me not, but say not so In bitterness. The common executioner, Whose heart th’ accustomed sight of death makes hard, Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck But first begs pardon. Will you sterner be Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?  Enter Rosalind, Celia and Corin, at a distance.  PHOEBE. I would not be thy executioner; I fly thee, for I would not injure thee. Thou tell’st me there is murder in mine eye. ’Tis pretty, sure, and very probable That eyes, that are the frail’st and softest things, Who shut their coward gates on atomies, Should be called tyrants, butchers, murderers. Now I do frown on thee with all my heart, And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee. Now counterfeit to swoon; why, now fall down; Or if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame, Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers. Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee. Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains Some scar of it; lean upon a rush, The cicatrice and capable impressure Thy palm some moment keeps. But now mine eyes, Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not; Nor I am sure there is not force in eyes That can do hurt.  SILVIUS. O dear Phoebe, If ever—as that ever may be near— You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy, Then shall you know the wounds invisible That love’s keen arrows make.  PHOEBE. But till that time Come not thou near me. And when that time comes, Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not, As till that time I shall not pity thee.  ROSALIND. [_Advancing_.] And why, I pray you? Who might be your mother, That you insult, exult, and all at once, Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty— As, by my faith, I see no more in you Than without candle may go dark to bed— Must you be therefore proud and pitiless? Why, what means this? Why do you look on me? I see no more in you than in the ordinary Of nature’s sale-work. ’Od’s my little life, I think she means to tangle my eyes too! No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it. ’Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair, Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream, That can entame my spirits to your worship. You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her, Like foggy south, puffing with wind and rain? You are a thousand times a properer man Than she a woman. ’Tis such fools as you That makes the world full of ill-favoured children. ’Tis not her glass but you that flatters her, And out of you she sees herself more proper Than any of her lineaments can show her. But, mistress, know yourself; down on your knees, And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man’s love. For I must tell you friendly in your ear, Sell when you can; you are not for all markets. Cry the man mercy, love him, take his offer; Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer. So take her to thee, shepherd. Fare you well.  PHOEBE. Sweet youth, I pray you chide a year together! I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.  ROSALIND. He’s fall’n in love with your foulness, and she’ll fall in love with my anger. If it be so, as fast as she answers thee with frowning looks, I’ll sauce her with bitter words. Why look you so upon me?  PHOEBE. For no ill will I bear you.  ROSALIND. I pray you do not fall in love with me, For I am falser than vows made in wine. Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house, ’Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by. Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard. Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better, And be not proud. Though all the world could see, None could be so abused in sight as he. Come, to our flock.  [_Exeunt Rosalind, Celia and Corin._]  PHOEBE. Dead shepherd, now I find thy saw of might: “Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?”  SILVIUS. Sweet Phoebe—  PHOEBE. Ha, what sayst thou, Silvius?  SILVIUS. Sweet Phoebe, pity me.  PHOEBE. Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.  SILVIUS. Wherever sorrow is, relief would be. If you do sorrow at my grief in love, By giving love your sorrow and my grief Were both extermined.  PHOEBE. Thou hast my love. Is not that neighbourly?  SILVIUS. I would have you.  PHOEBE. Why, that were covetousness. Silvius, the time was that I hated thee; And yet it is not that I bear thee love; But since that thou canst talk of love so well, Thy company, which erst was irksome to me, I will endure, and I’ll employ thee too. But do not look for further recompense Than thine own gladness that thou art employed.  SILVIUS. So holy and so perfect is my love, And I in such a poverty of grace, That I shall think it a most plenteous crop To glean the broken ears after the man That the main harvest reaps. Loose now and then A scattered smile, and that I’ll live upon.  PHOEBE. Know’st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile?  SILVIUS. Not very well, but I have met him oft, And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds That the old carlot once was master of.  PHOEBE. Think not I love him, though I ask for him. ’Tis but a peevish boy—yet he talks well. But what care I for words? Yet words do well When he that speaks them pleases those that hear. It is a pretty youth—not very pretty— But sure he’s proud, and yet his pride becomes him. He’ll make a proper man. The best thing in him Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue Did make offence, his eye did heal it up. He is not very tall, yet for his years he’s tall; His leg is but so-so, and yet ’tis well. There was a pretty redness in his lip, A little riper and more lusty red Than that mixed in his cheek. ’Twas just the difference Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask. There be some women, Silvius, had they marked him In parcels as I did, would have gone near To fall in love with him; but for my part I love him not nor hate him not; and yet I have more cause to hate him than to love him. For what had he to do to chide at me? He said mine eyes were black and my hair black, And now I am remembered, scorned at me. I marvel why I answered not again. But that’s all one: omittance is no quittance. I’ll write to him a very taunting letter, And thou shalt bear it. Wilt thou, Silvius?  SILVIUS. Phoebe, with all my heart.  PHOEBE. I’ll write it straight, The matter’s in my head and in my heart. I will be bitter with him and passing short. Go with me, Silvius.  [_Exeunt._]
  ACT IV  SCENE I. The Forest of Arden
Enter Rosalind, Celia and Jaques.  JAQUES. I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted with thee.  ROSALIND. They say you are a melancholy fellow.  JAQUES. I am so; I do love it better than laughing.  ROSALIND. Those that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows, and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards.  JAQUES. Why, ’tis good to be sad and say nothing.  ROSALIND. Why then, ’tis good to be a post.  JAQUES. I have neither the scholar’s melancholy, which is emulation; nor the musician’s, which is fantastical; nor the courtier’s, which is proud; nor the soldier’s, which is ambitious; nor the lawyer’s, which is politic; nor the lady’s, which is nice; nor the lover’s, which is all these; but it is a melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples, extracted from many objects, and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels, in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness.  ROSALIND. A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to be sad. I fear you have sold your own lands to see other men’s. Then to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands.  JAQUES. Yes, I have gained my experience.  ROSALIND. And your experience makes you sad. I had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad—and to travel for it too.  Enter Orlando.  ORLANDO. Good day and happiness, dear Rosalind!  JAQUES. Nay, then, God be wi’ you, an you talk in blank verse.  ROSALIND. Farewell, Monsieur Traveller. Look you lisp and wear strange suits; disable all the benefits of your own country; be out of love with your nativity, and almost chide God for making you that countenance you are, or I will scarce think you have swam in a gondola.  [_Exit Jaques._]  Why, how now, Orlando, where have you been all this while? You a lover! An you serve me such another trick, never come in my sight more.  ORLANDO. My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.  ROSALIND. Break an hour’s promise in love? He that will divide a minute into a thousand parts, and break but a part of the thousand part of a minute in the affairs of love, it may be said of him that Cupid hath clapped him o’ the shoulder, but I’ll warrant him heart-whole.  ORLANDO. Pardon me, dear Rosalind.  ROSALIND. Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight. I had as lief be wooed of a snail.  ORLANDO. Of a snail?  ROSALIND. Ay, of a snail, for though he comes slowly, he carries his house on his head—a better jointure, I think, than you make a woman. Besides, he brings his destiny with him.  ORLANDO. What’s that?  ROSALIND. Why, horns, which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for. But he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife.  ORLANDO. Virtue is no horn-maker and my Rosalind is virtuous.  ROSALIND. And I am your Rosalind.  CELIA. It pleases him to call you so, but he hath a Rosalind of a better leer than you.  ROSALIND. Come, woo me, woo me, for now I am in a holiday humour, and like enough to consent. What would you say to me now, an I were your very, very Rosalind?  ORLANDO. I would kiss before I spoke.  ROSALIND. Nay, you were better speak first, and when you were gravelled for lack of matter, you might take occasion to kiss. Very good orators, when they are out, they will spit; and for lovers lacking—God warn us—matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss.  ORLANDO. How if the kiss be denied?  ROSALIND. Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter.  ORLANDO. Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?  ROSALIND. Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress, or I should think my honesty ranker than my wit.  ORLANDO. What, of my suit?  ROSALIND. Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit. Am not I your Rosalind?  ORLANDO. I take some joy to say you are because I would be talking of her.  ROSALIND. Well, in her person, I say I will not have you.  ORLANDO. Then, in mine own person, I die.  ROSALIND. No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is almost six thousand years old, and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person, _videlicet_, in a love-cause. Troilus had his brains dashed out with a Grecian club, yet he did what he could to die before, and he is one of the patterns of love. Leander, he would have lived many a fair year though Hero had turned nun, if it had not been for a hot midsummer night; for, good youth, he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and, being taken with the cramp, was drowned; and the foolish chroniclers of that age found it was Hero of Sestos. But these are all lies. Men have died from time to time and worms have eaten them, but not for love.  ORLANDO. I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind, for I protest her frown might kill me.  ROSALIND. By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on disposition, and ask me what you will, I will grant it.  ORLANDO. Then love me, Rosalind.  ROSALIND. Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all.  ORLANDO. And wilt thou have me?  ROSALIND. Ay, and twenty such.  ORLANDO. What sayest thou?  ROSALIND. Are you not good?  ORLANDO. I hope so.  ROSALIND. Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?—Come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us.—Give me your hand, Orlando.—What do you say, sister?  ORLANDO. Pray thee, marry us.  CELIA. I cannot say the words.  ROSALIND. You must begin “Will you, Orlando—”
CELIA. Go to.—Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?  ORLANDO. I will.  ROSALIND. Ay, but when?  ORLANDO. Why now, as fast as she can marry us.  ROSALIND. Then you must say “I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.”  ORLANDO. I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.  ROSALIND. I might ask you for your commission. But I do take thee, Orlando, for my husband. There’s a girl goes before the priest, and certainly a woman’s thought runs before her actions.  ORLANDO. So do all thoughts. They are winged.  ROSALIND. Now tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed her.  ORLANDO. For ever and a day.  ROSALIND. Say “a day” without the “ever.” No, no, Orlando, men are April when they woo, December when they wed. Maids are May when they are maids, but the sky changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen, more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more new-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires than a monkey. I will weep for nothing, like Diana in the fountain, and I will do that when you are disposed to be merry. I will laugh like a hyena, and that when thou are inclined to sleep.  ORLANDO. But will my Rosalind do so?  ROSALIND. By my life, she will do as I do.  ORLANDO. O, but she is wise.  ROSALIND. Or else she could not have the wit to do this. The wiser, the waywarder. Make the doors upon a woman’s wit, and it will out at the casement. Shut that, and ’twill out at the keyhole. Stop that, ’twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney.  ORLANDO. A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say, “Wit, whither wilt?”  ROSALIND. Nay, you might keep that check for it till you met your wife’s wit going to your neighbour’s bed.  ORLANDO. And what wit could wit have to excuse that?  ROSALIND. Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall never take her without her answer unless you take her without her tongue. O, that woman that cannot make her fault her husband’s occasion, let her never nurse her child herself, for she will breed it like a fool.  ORLANDO. For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.  ROSALIND. Alas, dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours.  ORLANDO. I must attend the Duke at dinner. By two o’clock I will be with thee again.  ROSALIND. Ay, go your ways, go your ways. I knew what you would prove. My friends told me as much, and I thought no less. That flattering tongue of yours won me. ’Tis but one cast away, and so, come death! Two o’clock is your hour?  ORLANDO. Ay, sweet Rosalind.  ROSALIND. By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend me, and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous, if you break one jot of your promise or come one minute behind your hour, I will think you the most pathetical break-promise, and the most hollow lover, and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that may be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful. Therefore beware my censure, and keep your promise.  ORLANDO. With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my Rosalind. So, adieu.  ROSALIND. Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such offenders, and let time try. Adieu.  [_Exit Orlando._]  CELIA. You have simply misused our sex in your love-prate! We must have your doublet and hose plucked over your head and show the world what the bird hath done to her own nest.  ROSALIND. O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou didst know how many fathom deep I am in love! But it cannot be sounded; my affection hath an unknown bottom, like the Bay of Portugal.  CELIA. Or rather, bottomless, that as fast as you pour affection in, it runs out.  ROSALIND. No, that same wicked bastard of Venus, that was begot of thought, conceived of spleen, and born of madness, that blind rascally boy that abuses everyone’s eyes because his own are out, let him be judge how deep I am in love. I’ll tell thee, Aliena, I cannot be out of the sight of Orlando. I’ll go find a shadow and sigh till he come.  CELIA. And I’ll sleep.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. Another part of the Forest  Enter Jaques and Lords, like foresters.  JAQUES. Which is he that killed the deer?  FIRST LORD. Sir, it was I.  JAQUES. Let’s present him to the Duke, like a Roman conqueror, and it would do well to set the deer’s horns upon his head for a branch of victory. Have you no song, forester, for this purpose?  SECOND LORD. Yes, sir.  JAQUES. Sing it. ’Tis no matter how it be in tune, so it make noise enough.  SONG  SECOND LORD. [_Sings_.]   What shall he have that killed the deer?         His leather skin and horns to wear.                   Then sing him home:   [_The rest shall bear this burden_.]             Take thou no scorn to wear the horn.             It was a crest ere thou wast born.                   Thy father’s father wore it                   And thy father bore it.             The horn, the horn, the lusty horn             Is not a thing to laugh to scorn.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. Another part of the Forest  Enter Rosalind and Celia.  ROSALIND. How say you now? Is it not past two o’clock? And here much Orlando.  CELIA. I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain he hath ta’en his bow and arrows and is gone forth to sleep.  Enter Silvius.  Look who comes here.  SILVIUS. My errand is to you, fair youth. My gentle Phoebe did bid me give you this.  [_Giving a letter._]  I know not the contents, but, as I guess By the stern brow and waspish action Which she did use as she was writing of it, It bears an angry tenor. Pardon me, I am but as a guiltless messenger.  ROSALIND. Patience herself would startle at this letter And play the swaggerer. Bear this, bear all! She says I am not fair, that I lack manners; She calls me proud, and that she could not love me, Were man as rare as phoenix. ’Od’s my will, Her love is not the hare that I do hunt. Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well, This is a letter of your own device.  SILVIUS. No, I protest, I know not the contents. Phoebe did write it.  ROSALIND. Come, come, you are a fool, And turned into the extremity of love. I saw her hand. She has a leathern hand, A freestone-coloured hand. I verily did think That her old gloves were on, but ’twas her hands. She has a huswife’s hand—but that’s no matter. I say she never did invent this letter; This is a man’s invention, and his hand.  SILVIUS. Sure, it is hers.  ROSALIND. Why, ’tis a boisterous and a cruel style, A style for challengers. Why, she defies me, Like Turk to Christian. Women’s gentle brain Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention, Such Ethiop words, blacker in their effect Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?  SILVIUS. So please you, for I never heard it yet, Yet heard too much of Phoebe’s cruelty.  ROSALIND. She Phoebes me. Mark how the tyrant writes.  [_Reads._]              _Art thou god to shepherd turned,             That a maiden’s heart hath burned?_ Can a woman rail thus?  SILVIUS. Call you this railing?  ROSALIND.             _Why, thy godhead laid apart,             Warr’st thou with a woman’s heart?_ Did you ever hear such railing?             _Whiles the eye of man did woo me,             That could do no vengeance to me._ Meaning me a beast.             _If the scorn of your bright eyne             Have power to raise such love in mine,             Alack, in me what strange effect             Would they work in mild aspect?             Whiles you chid me, I did love,             How then might your prayers move?             He that brings this love to thee             Little knows this love in me;             And by him seal up thy mind,             Whether that thy youth and kind             Will the faithful offer take             Of me, and all that I can make,             Or else by him my love deny,             And then I’ll study how to die._  SILVIUS. Call you this chiding?  CELIA. Alas, poor shepherd.  ROSALIND. Do you pity him? No, he deserves no pity.—Wilt thou love such a woman? What, to make thee an instrument and play false strains upon thee? Not to be endured! Well, go your way to her, for I see love hath made thee a tame snake, and say this to her: that if she love me, I charge her to love thee; if she will not, I will never have her unless thou entreat for her. If you be a true lover, hence, and not a word, for here comes more company.  [_Exit Silvius._]  Enter Oliver.  OLIVER. Good morrow, fair ones. Pray you, if you know, Where in the purlieus of this forest stands A sheepcote fenced about with olive trees?  CELIA. West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom; The rank of osiers, by the murmuring stream, Left on your right hand, brings you to the place. But at this hour the house doth keep itself. There’s none within.  OLIVER. If that an eye may profit by a tongue, Then should I know you by description, Such garments, and such years. “The boy is fair, Of female favour, and bestows himself Like a ripe sister; the woman low, And browner than her brother.” Are not you The owner of the house I did inquire for?  CELIA. It is no boast, being asked, to say we are.  OLIVER. Orlando doth commend him to you both, And to that youth he calls his Rosalind He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?  ROSALIND. I am. What must we understand by this?  OLIVER. Some of my shame, if you will know of me What man I am, and how, and why, and where This handkerchief was stained.  CELIA. I pray you tell it.  OLIVER. When last the young Orlando parted from you, He left a promise to return again Within an hour, and pacing through the forest, Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy, Lo, what befell. He threw his eye aside, And mark what object did present itself. Under an oak, whose boughs were mossed with age And high top bald with dry antiquity, A wretched ragged man, o’ergrown with hair, Lay sleeping on his back; about his neck A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself, Who with her head, nimble in threats, approached The opening of his mouth. But suddenly, Seeing Orlando, it unlinked itself And with indented glides did slip away Into a bush; under which bush’s shade A lioness, with udders all drawn dry, Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch When that the sleeping man should stir. For ’tis The royal disposition of that beast To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead. This seen, Orlando did approach the man And found it was his brother, his elder brother.  CELIA. O, I have heard him speak of that same brother, And he did render him the most unnatural That lived amongst men.  OLIVER. And well he might so do, For well I know he was unnatural.  ROSALIND. But, to Orlando: did he leave him there, Food to the sucked and hungry lioness?  OLIVER. Twice did he turn his back and purposed so; But kindness, nobler ever than revenge, And nature, stronger than his just occasion, Made him give battle to the lioness, Who quickly fell before him; in which hurtling From miserable slumber I awaked.  CELIA. Are you his brother?  ROSALIND. Was it you he rescued?  CELIA. Was’t you that did so oft contrive to kill him?  OLIVER. ’Twas I; but ’tis not I. I do not shame To tell you what I was, since my conversion So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.  ROSALIND. But, for the bloody napkin?  OLIVER. By and by. When from the first to last betwixt us two Tears our recountments had most kindly bathed— As how I came into that desert place— In brief, he led me to the gentle Duke, Who gave me fresh array and entertainment, Committing me unto my brother’s love, Who led me instantly unto his cave, There stripped himself, and here upon his arm The lioness had torn some flesh away, Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted, And cried in fainting upon Rosalind. Brief, I recovered him, bound up his wound, And after some small space, being strong at heart, He sent me hither, stranger as I am, To tell this story, that you might excuse His broken promise, and to give this napkin, Dyed in his blood, unto the shepherd youth That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.  [_Rosalind faints._]  CELIA. Why, how now, Ganymede, sweet Ganymede!  OLIVER. Many will swoon when they do look on blood.  CELIA. There is more in it. Cousin—Ganymede!  OLIVER. Look, he recovers.  ROSALIND. I would I were at home.  CELIA. We’ll lead you thither. I pray you, will you take him by the arm?  OLIVER. Be of good cheer, youth. You a man? You lack a man’s heart.  ROSALIND. I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would think this was well counterfeited. I pray you tell your brother how well I counterfeited. Heigh-ho.  OLIVER. This was not counterfeit. There is too great testimony in your complexion that it was a passion of earnest.  ROSALIND. Counterfeit, I assure you.  OLIVER. Well then, take a good heart, and counterfeit to be a man.  ROSALIND. So I do. But, i’ faith, I should have been a woman by right.  CELIA. Come, you look paler and paler. Pray you draw homewards. Good sir, go with us.  OLIVER. That will I, for I must bear answer back How you excuse my brother, Rosalind.  ROSALIND. I shall devise something. But I pray you commend my counterfeiting to him. Will you go?  [_Exeunt._]
  ACT V  SCENE I. The Forest of Arden
Enter Touchstone and Audrey.  TOUCHSTONE. We shall find a time, Audrey; patience, gentle Audrey.  AUDREY. Faith, the priest was good enough, for all the old gentleman’s saying.  TOUCHSTONE. A most wicked Sir Oliver, Audrey, a most vile Martext. But Audrey, there is a youth here in the forest lays claim to you.  AUDREY. Ay, I know who ’tis. He hath no interest in me in the world.  Enter William.  Here comes the man you mean.  TOUCHSTONE. It is meat and drink to me to see a clown. By my troth, we that have good wits have much to answer for. We shall be flouting; we cannot hold.  WILLIAM. Good ev’n, Audrey.  AUDREY. God ye good ev’n, William.  WILLIAM. And good ev’n to you, sir.  TOUCHSTONE. Good ev’n, gentle friend. Cover thy head, cover thy head. Nay, prithee, be covered. How old are you, friend?  WILLIAM. Five-and-twenty, sir.  TOUCHSTONE. A ripe age. Is thy name William?  WILLIAM. William, sir.  TOUCHSTONE. A fair name. Wast born i’ th’ forest here?  WILLIAM. Ay, sir, I thank God.  TOUCHSTONE. “Thank God.” A good answer. Art rich?  WILLIAM. Faith, sir, so-so.  TOUCHSTONE. “So-so” is good, very good, very excellent good. And yet it is not, it is but so-so. Art thou wise?  WILLIAM. Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.  TOUCHSTONE. Why, thou sayst well. I do now remember a saying: “The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool.” The heathen philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a grape, would open his lips when he put it into his mouth, meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat and lips to open. You do love this maid?  WILLIAM. I do, sir.  TOUCHSTONE. Give me your hand. Art thou learned?  WILLIAM. No, sir.  TOUCHSTONE. Then learn this of me: to have is to have. For it is a figure in rhetoric that drink, being poured out of cup into a glass, by filling the one doth empty the other. For all your writers do consent that _ipse_ is “he.” Now, you are not _ipse_, for I am he.  WILLIAM. Which he, sir?  TOUCHSTONE. He, sir, that must marry this woman. Therefore, you clown, abandon—which is in the vulgar, “leave”—the society—which in the boorish is “company”—of this female—which in the common is “woman”; which together is, abandon the society of this female, or, clown, thou perishest; or, to thy better understanding, diest; or, to wit, I kill thee, make thee away, translate thy life into death, thy liberty into bondage. I will deal in poison with thee, or in bastinado, or in steel. I will bandy with thee in faction; will o’errun thee with policy. I will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways! Therefore tremble and depart.  AUDREY. Do, good William.  WILLIAM. God rest you merry, sir.  [_Exit._]  Enter Corin.  CORIN. Our master and mistress seek you. Come away, away.  TOUCHSTONE. Trip, Audrey, trip, Audrey! I attend, I attend.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. Another part of the Forest  Enter Orlando and Oliver.  ORLANDO. Is’t possible that on so little acquaintance you should like her? That but seeing, you should love her? And loving woo? And wooing, she should grant? And will you persever to enjoy her?  OLIVER. Neither call the giddiness of it in question, the poverty of her, the small acquaintance, my sudden wooing, nor her sudden consenting. But say with me, I love Aliena; say with her that she loves me; consent with both that we may enjoy each other. It shall be to your good, for my father’s house and all the revenue that was old Sir Rowland’s will I estate upon you, and here live and die a shepherd.  Enter Rosalind.  ORLANDO. You have my consent. Let your wedding be tomorrow. Thither will I invite the Duke and all’s contented followers. Go you and prepare Aliena; for, look you, here comes my Rosalind.  ROSALIND. God save you, brother.  OLIVER. And you, fair sister.  [_Exit._]  ROSALIND. O my dear Orlando, how it grieves me to see thee wear thy heart in a scarf!  ORLANDO. It is my arm.  ROSALIND. I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a lion.  ORLANDO. Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady.  ROSALIND. Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to swoon when he showed me your handkercher?  ORLANDO. Ay, and greater wonders than that.  ROSALIND. O, I know where you are. Nay, ’tis true. There was never anything so sudden but the fight of two rams, and Caesar’s thrasonical brag of “I came, saw and overcame.” For your brother and my sister no sooner met but they looked; no sooner looked but they loved; no sooner loved but they sighed; no sooner sighed but they asked one another the reason; no sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy; and in these degrees have they made pair of stairs to marriage, which they will climb incontinent, or else be incontinent before marriage. They are in the very wrath of love, and they will together. Clubs cannot part them.  ORLANDO. They shall be married tomorrow, and I will bid the Duke to the nuptial. But O, how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man’s eyes! By so much the more shall I tomorrow be at the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for.  ROSALIND. Why, then, tomorrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind?  ORLANDO. I can live no longer by thinking.  ROSALIND. I will weary you then no longer with idle talking. Know of me then—for now I speak to some purpose—that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit. I speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you are. Neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in some little measure draw a belief from you, to do yourself good, and not to grace me. Believe then, if you please, that I can do strange things. I have, since I was three year old, conversed with a magician, most profound in his art and yet not damnable. If you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it out, when your brother marries Aliena shall you marry her. I know into what straits of fortune she is driven and it is not impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient to you, to set her before your eyes tomorrow, human as she is, and without any danger.  ORLANDO. Speak’st thou in sober meanings?  ROSALIND. By my life, I do, which I tender dearly, though I say I am a magician. Therefore put you in your best array, bid your friends; for if you will be married tomorrow, you shall, and to Rosalind, if you will.  Enter Silvius and Phoebe.  Look, here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers.  PHOEBE. Youth, you have done me much ungentleness To show the letter that I writ to you.  ROSALIND. I care not if I have; it is my study To seem despiteful and ungentle to you. You are there followed by a faithful shepherd. Look upon him, love him; he worships you.  PHOEBE. Good shepherd, tell this youth what ’tis to love.  SILVIUS. It is to be all made of sighs and tears, And so am I for Phoebe.  PHOEBE. And I for Ganymede.  ORLANDO. And I for Rosalind.  ROSALIND. And I for no woman.  SILVIUS. It is to be all made of faith and service, And so am I for Phoebe.  PHOEBE. And I for Ganymede.  ORLANDO. And I for Rosalind.  ROSALIND. And I for no woman.  SILVIUS. It is to be all made of fantasy, All made of passion, and all made of wishes, All adoration, duty, and observance, All humbleness, all patience, and impatience, All purity, all trial, all observance, And so am I for Phoebe.  PHOEBE. And so am I for Ganymede.  ORLANDO. And so am I for Rosalind.  ROSALIND. And so am I for no woman.  PHOEBE. [_To Rosalind_.] If this be so, why blame you me to love you?  SILVIUS. [_To Phoebe_.] If this be so, why blame you me to love you?  ORLANDO. If this be so, why blame you me to love you?  ROSALIND. Why do you speak too, “Why blame you me to love you?”  ORLANDO. To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.  ROSALIND. Pray you, no more of this, ’tis like the howling of Irish wolves against the moon. [_to Silvius_.] I will help you if I can. [_to Phoebe_.] I would love you if I could.—Tomorrow meet me all together. [_to Phoebe_.] I will marry you, if ever I marry woman, and I’ll be married tomorrow. [_to Orlando_.] I will satisfy you if ever I satisfied man, and you shall be married tomorrow. [_to Silvius_.] I will content you, if what pleases you contents you, and you shall be married tomorrow. [_to Orlando_.] As you love Rosalind, meet. [_to Silvius_.] As you love Phoebe, meet.—And as I love no woman, I’ll meet. So fare you well. I have left you commands.  SILVIUS. I’ll not fail, if I live.  PHOEBE. Nor I.  ORLANDO. Nor I.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. Another part of the Forest  Enter Touchstone and Audrey.  TOUCHSTONE. Tomorrow is the joyful day, Audrey, tomorrow will we be married.  AUDREY. I do desire it with all my heart; and I hope it is no dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the world.  Enter two Pages.  Here come two of the banished Duke’s pages.  FIRST PAGE. Well met, honest gentleman.  TOUCHSTONE. By my troth, well met. Come sit, sit, and a song.  SECOND PAGE. We are for you, sit i’ th’ middle.  FIRST PAGE. Shall we clap into’t roundly, without hawking or spitting or saying we are hoarse, which are the only prologues to a bad voice?  SECOND PAGE. I’faith, i’faith, and both in a tune like two gipsies on a horse.                          SONG  PAGES. [_Sing_.]     It was a lover and his lass,         With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,     That o’er the green cornfield did pass         In the spring-time, the only pretty ring time,         When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding.     Sweet lovers love the spring.      Between the acres of the rye,         With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,     These pretty country folks would lie,         In the spring-time, the only pretty ring time,         When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding.     Sweet lovers love the spring.      This carol they began that hour,         With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,     How that a life was but a flower,         In the spring-time, the only pretty ring time,         When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding.     Sweet lovers love the spring.      And therefore take the present time,         With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,     For love is crowned with the prime,         In the spring-time, the only pretty ring time,         When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding.     Sweet lovers love the spring.  TOUCHSTONE Truly, young gentlemen, though there was no great matter in the ditty, yet the note was very untuneable.  FIRST PAGE. You are deceived, sir, we kept time, we lost not our time.  TOUCHSTONE. By my troth, yes. I count it but time lost to hear such a foolish song. God be wi’ you, and God mend your voices. Come, Audrey.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IV. Another part of the Forest  Enter Duke Senior, Amiens, Jaques, Orlando, Oliver and Celia.  DUKE SENIOR. Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy Can do all this that he hath promised?  ORLANDO. I sometimes do believe and sometimes do not, As those that fear they hope, and know they fear.  Enter Rosalind, Silvius and Phoebe.  ROSALIND. Patience once more whiles our compact is urged. [_To the Duke._] You say, if I bring in your Rosalind, You will bestow her on Orlando here?  DUKE SENIOR. That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.  ROSALIND. [_To Orlando_.] And you say you will have her when I bring her?  ORLANDO. That would I, were I of all kingdoms king.  ROSALIND. [_To Phoebe_.] You say you’ll marry me if I be willing?  PHOEBE. That will I, should I die the hour after.  ROSALIND. But if you do refuse to marry me, You’ll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?  PHOEBE. So is the bargain.  ROSALIND. [_To Silvius_.] You say that you’ll have Phoebe if she will?  SILVIUS. Though to have her and death were both one thing.  ROSALIND. I have promised to make all this matter even. Keep you your word, O Duke, to give your daughter, You yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter. Keep your word, Phoebe, that you’ll marry me, Or else, refusing me, to wed this shepherd. Keep your word, Silvius, that you’ll marry her If she refuse me. And from hence I go To make these doubts all even.  [_Exeunt Rosalind and Celia._]  DUKE SENIOR. I do remember in this shepherd boy Some lively touches of my daughter’s favour.  ORLANDO. My lord, the first time that I ever saw him Methought he was a brother to your daughter. But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born And hath been tutored in the rudiments Of many desperate studies by his uncle, Whom he reports to be a great magician, Obscured in the circle of this forest.  Enter Touchstone and Audrey.  JAQUES. There is sure another flood toward, and these couples are coming to the ark. Here comes a pair of very strange beasts, which in all tongues are called fools.  TOUCHSTONE. Salutation and greeting to you all.  JAQUES. Good my lord, bid him welcome. This is the motley-minded gentleman that I have so often met in the forest. He hath been a courtier, he swears.  TOUCHSTONE. If any man doubt that, let him put me to my purgation. I have trod a measure; I have flattered a lady; I have been politic with my friend, smooth with mine enemy; I have undone three tailors; I have had four quarrels, and like to have fought one.  JAQUES. And how was that ta’en up?  TOUCHSTONE. Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the seventh cause.  JAQUES. How seventh cause?—Good my lord, like this fellow?  DUKE SENIOR. I like him very well.  TOUCHSTONE. God ’ild you, sir, I desire you of the like. I press in here, sir, amongst the rest of the country copulatives, to swear and to forswear according as marriage binds and blood breaks. A poor virgin, sir, an ill-favoured thing, sir, but mine own; a poor humour of mine, sir, to take that that no man else will. Rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a poor house, as your pearl in your foul oyster.  DUKE SENIOR. By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.  TOUCHSTONE. According to the fool’s bolt, sir, and such dulcet diseases.  JAQUES. But, for the seventh cause. How did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause?  TOUCHSTONE. Upon a lie seven times removed—bear your body more seeming, Audrey—as thus, sir. I did dislike the cut of a certain courtier’s beard. He sent me word if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the mind it was. This is called the “retort courteous”. If I sent him word again it was not well cut, he would send me word he cut it to please himself. This is called the “quip modest”. If again it was not well cut, he disabled my judgement. This is called the “reply churlish”. If again it was not well cut, he would answer I spake not true. This is called the “reproof valiant”. If again it was not well cut, he would say I lie. This is called the “countercheck quarrelsome”, and so, to the “lie circumstantial”, and the “lie direct”.  JAQUES. And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?  TOUCHSTONE. I durst go no further than the lie circumstantial, nor he durst not give me the lie direct; and so we measured swords and parted.  JAQUES. Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?  TOUCHSTONE. O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book, as you have books for good manners. I will name you the degrees: the first, the retort courteous; the second, the quip modest; the third, the reply churlish; the fourth, the reproof valiant; the fifth, the countercheck quarrelsome; the sixth, the lie with circumstance; the seventh, the lie direct. All these you may avoid but the lie direct and you may avoid that too with an “if”. I knew when seven justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the parties were met themselves, one of them thought but of an “if”, as, “if you said so, then I said so;” and they shook hands, and swore brothers. Your “if” is the only peacemaker; much virtue in “if.”  JAQUES. Is not this a rare fellow, my lord? He’s as good at anything, and yet a fool.  DUKE SENIOR. He uses his folly like a stalking-horse, and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit.  Enter Hymen, Rosalind in woman’s clothes, and Celia. Still music.  HYMEN.     Then is there mirth in heaven     When earthly things made even         Atone together.     Good Duke, receive thy daughter.     Hymen from heaven brought her,         Yea, brought her hither,     That thou mightst join her hand with his,     Whose heart within his bosom is.  ROSALIND. [_To Duke Senior_.] To you I give myself, for I am yours. [_To Orlando_.] To you I give myself, for I am yours.  DUKE SENIOR. If there be truth in sight, you are my daughter.  ORLANDO. If there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind.  PHOEBE. If sight and shape be true, Why then, my love adieu.  ROSALIND. [_To Duke Senior_.] I’ll have no father, if you be not he. [_To Orlando_.] I’ll have no husband, if you be not he. [_To Phoebe_.] Nor ne’er wed woman, if you be not she.  HYMEN.     Peace, ho! I bar confusion.     ’Tis I must make conclusion         Of these most strange events.     Here’s eight that must take hands     To join in Hymen’s bands,         If truth holds true contents. [_To Orlando and Rosalind_.] You and you no cross shall part. [_To Celia and Oliver_.] You and you are heart in heart. [_To Phoebe_.] You to his love must accord Or have a woman to your lord. [_To Audrey and Touchstone_.] You and you are sure together As the winter to foul weather. Whiles a wedlock hymn we sing, Feed yourselves with questioning, That reason wonder may diminish How thus we met, and these things finish.                           SONG       Wedding is great Juno’s crown,             O blessed bond of board and bed.       ’Tis Hymen peoples every town,             High wedlock then be honoured.       Honour, high honour, and renown       To Hymen, god of every town.  DUKE SENIOR. O my dear niece, welcome thou art to me Even daughter, welcome in no less degree.  PHOEBE. [_To Silvius_.] I will not eat my word, now thou art mine, Thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine.  Enter Jaques de Boys.  JAQUES DE BOYS. Let me have audience for a word or two. I am the second son of old Sir Rowland, That bring these tidings to this fair assembly. Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day Men of great worth resorted to this forest, Addressed a mighty power, which were on foot In his own conduct, purposely to take His brother here and put him to the sword; And to the skirts of this wild wood he came, Where, meeting with an old religious man, After some question with him, was converted Both from his enterprise and from the world, His crown bequeathing to his banished brother, And all their lands restored to them again That were with him exiled. This to be true I do engage my life.  DUKE SENIOR. Welcome, young man. Thou offer’st fairly to thy brother’s wedding: To one his lands withheld, and to the other A land itself at large, a potent dukedom. First, in this forest let us do those ends That here were well begun and well begot; And after, every of this happy number That have endured shrewd days and nights with us Shall share the good of our returned fortune, According to the measure of their states. Meantime, forget this new-fall’n dignity, And fall into our rustic revelry. Play, music! And you brides and bridegrooms all, With measure heaped in joy to th’ measures fall.  JAQUES. Sir, by your patience. If I heard you rightly, The Duke hath put on a religious life And thrown into neglect the pompous court.  JAQUES DE BOYS. He hath.  JAQUES. To him will I. Out of these convertites There is much matter to be heard and learned. [_To Duke Senior_.] You to your former honour I bequeath; Your patience and your virtue well deserves it. [_To Orlando_.] You to a love that your true faith doth merit. [_To Oliver_.] You to your land, and love, and great allies. [_To Silvius_.] You to a long and well-deserved bed. [_To Touchstone_.] And you to wrangling, for thy loving voyage Is but for two months victualled.—So to your pleasures, I am for other than for dancing measures.  DUKE SENIOR. Stay, Jaques, stay.  JAQUES. To see no pastime, I. What you would have I’ll stay to know at your abandoned cave.  [_Exit._]  DUKE SENIOR. Proceed, proceed! We will begin these rites, As we do trust they’ll end, in true delights.  [_Dance. Exeunt all but Rosalind._]  EPILOGUE  ROSALIND. It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue, but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue. If it be true that good wine needs no bush, ’tis true that a good play needs no epilogue. Yet to good wine they do use good bushes, and good plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues. What a case am I in then, that am neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play! I am not furnished like a beggar; therefore to beg will not become me. My way is to conjure you, and I’ll begin with the women. I charge you, O women, for the love you bear to men, to like as much of this play as please you. And I charge you, O men, for the love you bear to women—as I perceive by your simpering, none of you hates them—that between you and the women the play may please. If I were a woman, I would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased me, complexions that liked me, and breaths that I defied not. And I am sure as many as have good beards, or good faces, or sweet breaths will for my kind offer, when I make curtsy, bid me farewell.  [_Exit._]

ACT I  SCENE I. A hall in the Duke’s palace   Enter Duke, Egeon, Jailer, Officers and other Attendants.  EGEON. Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall, And by the doom of death end woes and all.  DUKE. Merchant of Syracusa, plead no more. I am not partial to infringe our laws. The enmity and discord which of late Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your Duke To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen, Who, wanting guilders to redeem their lives, Have seal’d his rigorous statutes with their bloods, Excludes all pity from our threat’ning looks. For since the mortal and intestine jars ’Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us, It hath in solemn synods been decreed, Both by the Syracusians and ourselves, To admit no traffic to our adverse towns; Nay more, if any born at Ephesus Be seen at Syracusian marts and fairs; Again, if any Syracusian born Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies, His goods confiscate to the Duke’s dispose, Unless a thousand marks be levied To quit the penalty and to ransom him. Thy substance, valued at the highest rate, Cannot amount unto a hundred marks; Therefore by law thou art condemn’d to die.  EGEON. Yet this my comfort; when your words are done, My woes end likewise with the evening sun.  DUKE. Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause Why thou departedst from thy native home, And for what cause thou cam’st to Ephesus.  EGEON. A heavier task could not have been impos’d Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable; Yet, that the world may witness that my end Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence, I’ll utter what my sorrow gives me leave. In Syracusa was I born, and wed Unto a woman happy but for me, And by me, had not our hap been bad. With her I liv’d in joy; our wealth increas’d By prosperous voyages I often made To Epidamnum, till my factor’s death, And the great care of goods at random left, Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse; From whom my absence was not six months old Before herself (almost at fainting under The pleasing punishment that women bear) Had made provision for her following me, And soon and safe arrived where I was. There had she not been long but she became A joyful mother of two goodly sons, And, which was strange, the one so like the other As could not be distinguish’d but by names. That very hour, and in the self-same inn, A mean woman was delivered Of such a burden, male twins, both alike. Those, for their parents were exceeding poor, I bought, and brought up to attend my sons. My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys, Made daily motions for our home return. Unwilling I agreed; alas, too soon We came aboard. A league from Epidamnum had we sail’d Before the always-wind-obeying deep Gave any tragic instance of our harm; But longer did we not retain much hope; For what obscured light the heavens did grant Did but convey unto our fearful minds A doubtful warrant of immediate death, Which though myself would gladly have embrac’d, Yet the incessant weepings of my wife, Weeping before for what she saw must come, And piteous plainings of the pretty babes, That mourn’d for fashion, ignorant what to fear, Forc’d me to seek delays for them and me. And this it was (for other means was none). The sailors sought for safety by our boat, And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us. My wife, more careful for the latter-born, Had fast’ned him unto a small spare mast, Such as sea-faring men provide for storms. To him one of the other twins was bound, Whilst I had been like heedful of the other. The children thus dispos’d, my wife and I, Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix’d, Fast’ned ourselves at either end the mast, And, floating straight, obedient to the stream, Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought. At length the sun, gazing upon the earth, Dispers’d those vapours that offended us, And by the benefit of his wished light The seas wax’d calm, and we discovered Two ships from far, making amain to us, Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this. But ere they came—O, let me say no more! Gather the sequel by that went before.  DUKE. Nay, forward, old man, do not break off so, For we may pity, though not pardon thee.  EGEON. O, had the gods done so, I had not now Worthily term’d them merciless to us. For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues, We were encountered by a mighty rock, Which being violently borne upon, Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst; So that, in this unjust divorce of us, Fortune had left to both of us alike What to delight in, what to sorrow for. Her part, poor soul, seeming as burdened With lesser weight, but not with lesser woe, Was carried with more speed before the wind, And in our sight they three were taken up By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought. At length another ship had seiz’d on us; And, knowing whom it was their hap to save, Gave healthful welcome to their ship-wrack’d guests, And would have reft the fishers of their prey, Had not their bark been very slow of sail; And therefore homeward did they bend their course. Thus have you heard me sever’d from my bliss, That by misfortunes was my life prolong’d To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.  DUKE. And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for, Do me the favour to dilate at full What have befall’n of them and thee till now.  EGEON. My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care, At eighteen years became inquisitive After his brother, and importun’d me That his attendant, so his case was like, Reft of his brother, but retain’d his name, Might bear him company in the quest of him; Whom whilst I laboured of a love to see, I hazarded the loss of whom I lov’d. Five summers have I spent in farthest Greece, Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia, And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus, Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought Or that or any place that harbours men. But here must end the story of my life; And happy were I in my timely death, Could all my travels warrant me they live.  DUKE. Hapless Egeon, whom the fates have mark’d To bear the extremity of dire mishap; Now, trust me, were it not against our laws, Against my crown, my oath, my dignity, Which princes, would they, may not disannul, My soul should sue as advocate for thee. But though thou art adjudged to the death, And passed sentence may not be recall’d But to our honour’s great disparagement, Yet will I favour thee in what I can. Therefore, merchant, I’ll limit thee this day To seek thy health by beneficial help. Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus; Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum, And live; if no, then thou art doom’d to die. Jailer, take him to thy custody.  JAILER. I will, my lord.  EGEON. Hopeless and helpless doth Egeon wend, But to procrastinate his lifeless end.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. A public place   Enter Antipholus and Dromio of Syracuse and a Merchant.  MERCHANT. Therefore give out you are of Epidamnum, Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate. This very day a Syracusian merchant Is apprehended for arrival here, And, not being able to buy out his life, According to the statute of the town Dies ere the weary sun set in the west. There is your money that I had to keep.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host, And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee. Within this hour it will be dinnertime; Till that, I’ll view the manners of the town, Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings, And then return and sleep within mine inn, For with long travel I am stiff and weary. Get thee away.  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Many a man would take you at your word, And go indeed, having so good a mean.   [_Exit Dromio._]  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. A trusty villain, sir, that very oft, When I am dull with care and melancholy, Lightens my humour with his merry jests. What, will you walk with me about the town, And then go to my inn and dine with me?  MERCHANT. I am invited, sir, to certain merchants, Of whom I hope to make much benefit. I crave your pardon. Soon, at five o’clock, Please you, I’ll meet with you upon the mart, And afterward consort you till bedtime. My present business calls me from you now.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Farewell till then: I will go lose myself, And wander up and down to view the city.  MERCHANT. Sir, I commend you to your own content.   [_Exit Merchant._]  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. He that commends me to mine own content Commends me to the thing I cannot get. I to the world am like a drop of water That in the ocean seeks another drop, Who, failing there to find his fellow forth, Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself. So I, to find a mother and a brother, In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.   Enter Dromio of Ephesus.  Here comes the almanac of my true date. What now? How chance thou art return’d so soon?  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Return’d so soon? rather approach’d too late. The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit; The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell; My mistress made it one upon my cheek. She is so hot because the meat is cold; The meat is cold because you come not home; You come not home because you have no stomach; You have no stomach, having broke your fast; But we that know what ’tis to fast and pray, Are penitent for your default today.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Stop in your wind, sir, tell me this, I pray: Where have you left the money that I gave you?  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. O, sixpence that I had o’ Wednesday last To pay the saddler for my mistress’ crupper: The saddler had it, sir, I kept it not.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I am not in a sportive humour now. Tell me, and dally not, where is the money? We being strangers here, how dar’st thou trust So great a charge from thine own custody?  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I pray you jest, sir, as you sit at dinner: I from my mistress come to you in post; If I return, I shall be post indeed, For she will score your fault upon my pate. Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock, And strike you home without a messenger.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season, Reserve them till a merrier hour than this. Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. To me, sir? why, you gave no gold to me!  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness, And tell me how thou hast dispos’d thy charge.  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. My charge was but to fetch you from the mart Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner. My mistress and her sister stay for you.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Now, as I am a Christian, answer me In what safe place you have bestow’d my money, Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours That stands on tricks when I am undispos’d; Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I have some marks of yours upon my pate, Some of my mistress’ marks upon my shoulders, But not a thousand marks between you both. If I should pay your worship those again, Perchance you will not bear them patiently.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thy mistress’ marks? what mistress, slave, hast thou?  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Your worship’s wife, my mistress at the Phoenix; She that doth fast till you come home to dinner, And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face, Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave.  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. What mean you, sir? for God’s sake hold your hands. Nay, an you will not, sir, I’ll take my heels.   [_Exit Dromio._]  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Upon my life, by some device or other The villain is o’er-raught of all my money. They say this town is full of cozenage, As nimble jugglers that deceive the eye, Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind, Soul-killing witches that deform the body, Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks, And many such-like liberties of sin: If it prove so, I will be gone the sooner. I’ll to the Centaur to go seek this slave. I greatly fear my money is not safe.   [_Exit._]
 ACT II  SCENE I. A public place   Enter Adriana, wife to Antipholus (of Ephesus) with Luciana her  sister.  ADRIANA. Neither my husband nor the slave return’d That in such haste I sent to seek his master? Sure, Luciana, it is two o’clock.  LUCIANA. Perhaps some merchant hath invited him, And from the mart he’s somewhere gone to dinner. Good sister, let us dine, and never fret; A man is master of his liberty; Time is their master, and when they see time, They’ll go or come. If so, be patient, sister.  ADRIANA. Why should their liberty than ours be more?  LUCIANA. Because their business still lies out o’ door.  ADRIANA. Look when I serve him so, he takes it ill.  LUCIANA. O, know he is the bridle of your will.  ADRIANA. There’s none but asses will be bridled so.  LUCIANA. Why, headstrong liberty is lash’d with woe. There’s nothing situate under heaven’s eye But hath his bound in earth, in sea, in sky. The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls Are their males’ subjects, and at their controls. Man, more divine, the masters of all these, Lord of the wide world and wild wat’ry seas, Indued with intellectual sense and souls, Of more pre-eminence than fish and fowls, Are masters to their females, and their lords: Then let your will attend on their accords.  ADRIANA. This servitude makes you to keep unwed.  LUCIANA. Not this, but troubles of the marriage-bed.  ADRIANA. But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.  LUCIANA. Ere I learn love, I’ll practise to obey.  ADRIANA. How if your husband start some other where?  LUCIANA. Till he come home again, I would forbear.  ADRIANA. Patience unmov’d! No marvel though she pause; They can be meek that have no other cause. A wretched soul bruis’d with adversity, We bid be quiet when we hear it cry; But were we burd’ned with like weight of pain, As much, or more, we should ourselves complain: So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee, With urging helpless patience would relieve me: But if thou live to see like right bereft, This fool-begg’d patience in thee will be left.  LUCIANA. Well, I will marry one day, but to try. Here comes your man, now is your husband nigh.   Enter Dromio of Ephesus.  ADRIANA. Say, is your tardy master now at hand?  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Nay, he’s at two hands with me, and that my two ears can witness.  ADRIANA. Say, didst thou speak with him? know’st thou his mind?  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear. Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.  LUCIANA. Spake he so doubtfully thou couldst not feel his meaning?  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Nay, he struck so plainly I could too well feel his blows; and withal so doubtfully that I could scarce understand them.  ADRIANA. But say, I prithee, is he coming home? It seems he hath great care to please his wife.  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad.  ADRIANA. Horn-mad, thou villain?  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I mean not cuckold-mad, But sure he’s stark mad. When I desir’d him to come home to dinner, He ask’d me for a thousand marks in gold. “’Tis dinner time,” quoth I. “My gold,” quoth he. “Your meat doth burn” quoth I. “My gold,” quoth he. “Will you come home?” quoth I. “My gold,” quoth he. “Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?” “The pig” quoth I “is burn’d”. “My gold,” quoth he. “My mistress, sir,” quoth I. “Hang up thy mistress; I know not thy mistress; out on thy mistress!”  LUCIANA. Quoth who?  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Quoth my master. “I know,” quoth he, “no house, no wife, no mistress.” So that my errand, due unto my tongue, I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders; For, in conclusion, he did beat me there.  ADRIANA. Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Go back again, and be new beaten home? For God’s sake, send some other messenger.  ADRIANA. Back slave, or I will break thy pate across.  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. And he will bless that cross with other beating. Between you I shall have a holy head.  ADRIANA. Hence, prating peasant. Fetch thy master home.  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Am I so round with you, as you with me, That like a football you do spurn me thus? You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither. If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.   [_Exit._]  LUCIANA. Fie, how impatience loureth in your face.  ADRIANA. His company must do his minions grace, Whilst I at home starve for a merry look. Hath homely age th’ alluring beauty took From my poor cheek? then he hath wasted it. Are my discourses dull? barren my wit? If voluble and sharp discourse be marr’d, Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard. Do their gay vestments his affections bait? That’s not my fault; he’s master of my state. What ruins are in me that can be found By him not ruin’d? Then is he the ground Of my defeatures. My decayed fair A sunny look of his would soon repair; But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.  LUCIANA. Self-harming jealousy! fie, beat it hence.  ADRIANA. Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense. I know his eye doth homage otherwhere, Or else what lets it but he would be here? Sister, you know he promis’d me a chain; Would that alone, a love he would detain, So he would keep fair quarter with his bed. I see the jewel best enamelled Will lose his beauty; yet the gold bides still That others touch, yet often touching will Wear gold; and no man that hath a name By falsehood and corruption doth it shame. Since that my beauty cannot please his eye, I’ll weep what’s left away, and weeping die.  LUCIANA. How many fond fools serve mad jealousy!   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. The same   Enter Antipholus of Syracuse.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up Safe at the Centaur, and the heedful slave Is wander’d forth in care to seek me out. By computation and mine host’s report. I could not speak with Dromio since at first I sent him from the mart. See, here he comes.   Enter Dromio of Syracuse.  How now, sir! is your merry humour alter’d? As you love strokes, so jest with me again. You know no Centaur? you receiv’d no gold? Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner? My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad, That thus so madly thou didst answer me?  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. What answer, sir? when spake I such a word?  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Even now, even here, not half an hour since.  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I did not see you since you sent me hence, Home to the Centaur with the gold you gave me.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Villain, thou didst deny the gold’s receipt, And told’st me of a mistress and a dinner, For which I hope thou felt’st I was displeas’d.  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I am glad to see you in this merry vein. What means this jest, I pray you, master, tell me?  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth? Think’st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that.   [_Beats Dromio._]  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Hold, sir, for God’s sake, now your jest is earnest. Upon what bargain do you give it me?  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Because that I familiarly sometimes Do use you for my fool, and chat with you, Your sauciness will jest upon my love, And make a common of my serious hours. When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport, But creep in crannies when he hides his beams. If you will jest with me, know my aspect, And fashion your demeanour to my looks, Or I will beat this method in your sconce.  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Sconce, call you it? so you would leave battering, I had rather have it a head. And you use these blows long, I must get a sconce for my head, and ensconce it too, or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders. But I pray, sir, why am I beaten?  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Dost thou not know?  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Shall I tell you why?  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say, every why hath a wherefore.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, first, for flouting me; and then wherefore, For urging it the second time to me.  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season, When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme nor reason? Well, sir, I thank you.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thank me, sir, for what?  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, sir, for this something that you gave me for nothing.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I’ll make you amends next, to give you nothing for something. But say, sir, is it dinner-time?  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, sir; I think the meat wants that I have.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. In good time, sir, what’s that?  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Basting.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, then ’twill be dry.  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. If it be, sir, I pray you eat none of it.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Your reason?  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Lest it make you choleric, and purchase me another dry basting.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, learn to jest in good time. There’s a time for all things.  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I durst have denied that before you were so choleric.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. By what rule, sir?  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald pate of Father Time himself.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Let’s hear it.  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. There’s no time for a man to recover his hair that grows bald by nature.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. May he not do it by fine and recovery?  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig, and recover the lost hair of another man.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being, as it is, so plentiful an excrement?  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts, and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, but there’s many a man hath more hair than wit.  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit.  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. The plainer dealer, the sooner lost. Yet he loseth it in a kind of jollity.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. For what reason?  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. For two, and sound ones too.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Nay, not sound, I pray you.  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Sure ones, then.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Certain ones, then.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Name them.  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. The one, to save the money that he spends in tiring; the other, that at dinner they should not drop in his porridge.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. You would all this time have proved there is no time for all things.  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, and did, sir; namely, e’en no time to recover hair lost by nature.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. But your reason was not substantial why there is no time to recover.  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald, and therefore, to the world’s end will have bald followers.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I knew ’twould be a bald conclusion. But soft! who wafts us yonder?   Enter Adriana and Luciana.  ADRIANA. Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown, Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects. I am not Adriana, nor thy wife. The time was once when thou unurg’d wouldst vow That never words were music to thine ear, That never object pleasing in thine eye, That never touch well welcome to thy hand, That never meat sweet-savour’d in thy taste, Unless I spake, or look’d, or touch’d, or carv’d to thee. How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it, That thou art then estranged from thyself? Thyself I call it, being strange to me, That, undividable, incorporate, Am better than thy dear self’s better part. Ah, do not tear away thyself from me; For know, my love, as easy mayst thou fall A drop of water in the breaking gulf, And take unmingled thence that drop again Without addition or diminishing, As take from me thyself, and not me too. How dearly would it touch thee to the quick, Should’st thou but hear I were licentious? And that this body, consecrate to thee, By ruffian lust should be contaminate? Wouldst thou not spit at me, and spurn at me, And hurl the name of husband in my face, And tear the stain’d skin off my harlot brow, And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring, And break it with a deep-divorcing vow? I know thou canst; and therefore, see thou do it. I am possess’d with an adulterate blot; My blood is mingled with the crime of lust; For if we two be one, and thou play false, I do digest the poison of thy flesh, Being strumpeted by thy contagion. Keep then fair league and truce with thy true bed, I live distain’d, thou undishonoured.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not. In Ephesus I am but two hours old, As strange unto your town as to your talk, Who, every word by all my wit being scann’d, Wants wit in all one word to understand.  LUCIANA. Fie, brother, how the world is chang’d with you. When were you wont to use my sister thus? She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. By Dromio?  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. By me?  ADRIANA. By thee; and this thou didst return from him, That he did buffet thee, and in his blows Denied my house for his, me for his wife.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman? What is the course and drift of your compact?  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I, sir? I never saw her till this time.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Villain, thou liest, for even her very words Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I never spake with her in all my life.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. How can she thus, then, call us by our names? Unless it be by inspiration.  ADRIANA. How ill agrees it with your gravity To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave, Abetting him to thwart me in my mood; Be it my wrong, you are from me exempt, But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt. Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine. Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine, Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state, Makes me with thy strength to communicate: If aught possess thee from me, it is dross, Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss, Who all, for want of pruning, with intrusion Infect thy sap, and live on thy confusion.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme. What, was I married to her in my dream? Or sleep I now, and think I hear all this? What error drives our eyes and ears amiss? Until I know this sure uncertainty I’ll entertain the offer’d fallacy.  LUCIANA. Dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner.  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. O, for my beads! I cross me for a sinner. This is the fairy land; O spite of spites! We talk with goblins, owls, and sprites; If we obey them not, this will ensue: They’ll suck our breath, or pinch us black and blue.  LUCIANA. Why prat’st thou to thyself, and answer’st not? Dromio, thou drone, thou snail, thou slug, thou sot.  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I am transformed, master, am I not?  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think thou art in mind, and so am I.  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou hast thine own form.  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, I am an ape.  LUCIANA. If thou art chang’d to aught, ’tis to an ass.  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. ’Tis true; she rides me, and I long for grass. ’Tis so, I am an ass; else it could never be But I should know her as well as she knows me.  ADRIANA. Come, come, no longer will I be a fool, To put the finger in the eye and weep Whilst man and master laughs my woes to scorn. Come, sir, to dinner; Dromio, keep the gate. Husband, I’ll dine above with you today, And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks. Sirrah, if any ask you for your master, Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter. Come, sister; Dromio, play the porter well.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell? Sleeping or waking, mad, or well-advis’d? Known unto these, and to myself disguis’d! I’ll say as they say, and persever so, And in this mist at all adventures go.  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, shall I be porter at the gate?  ADRIANA. Ay; and let none enter, lest I break your pate.  LUCIANA. Come, come, Antipholus, we dine too late.   [_Exeunt._]
 ACT IV  SCENE I. The same   Enter Merchant, Angelo and an Officer.  MERCHANT. You know since Pentecost the sum is due, And since I have not much importun’d you, Nor now I had not, but that I am bound To Persia, and want guilders for my voyage; Therefore make present satisfaction, Or I’ll attach you by this officer.  ANGELO. Even just the sum that I do owe to you Is growing to me by Antipholus, And in the instant that I met with you He had of me a chain; at five o’clock I shall receive the money for the same. Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house, I will discharge my bond, and thank you too.   Enter Antipholus of Ephesus and Dromio of Ephesus from the  Courtesan’s.  OFFICER. That labour may you save. See where he comes.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. While I go to the goldsmith’s house, go thou And buy a rope’s end; that will I bestow Among my wife and her confederates For locking me out of my doors by day. But soft, I see the goldsmith; get thee gone; Buy thou a rope, and bring it home to me.  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I buy a thousand pound a year! I buy a rope!   [_Exit Dromio._]  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. A man is well holp up that trusts to you, I promised your presence and the chain, But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me. Belike you thought our love would last too long If it were chain’d together, and therefore came not.  ANGELO. Saving your merry humour, here’s the note How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat, The fineness of the gold, and chargeful fashion, Which doth amount to three odd ducats more Than I stand debted to this gentleman. I pray you, see him presently discharg’d, For he is bound to sea, and stays but for it.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I am not furnished with the present money; Besides, I have some business in the town. Good signior, take the stranger to my house, And with you take the chain, and bid my wife Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof; Perchance I will be there as soon as you.  ANGELO. Then you will bring the chain to her yourself.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. No, bear it with you, lest I come not time enough.  ANGELO. Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about you?  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And if I have not, sir, I hope you have, Or else you may return without your money.  ANGELO. Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain; Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman, And I, to blame, have held him here too long.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Good Lord, you use this dalliance to excuse Your breach of promise to the Porpentine. I should have chid you for not bringing it, But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl.  MERCHANT. The hour steals on; I pray you, sir, dispatch.  ANGELO. You hear how he importunes me. The chain!  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Why, give it to my wife, and fetch your money.  ANGELO. Come, come, you know I gave it you even now. Either send the chain or send by me some token.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Fie, now you run this humour out of breath. Come, where’s the chain? I pray you, let me see it.  MERCHANT. My business cannot brook this dalliance. Good sir, say whe’er you’ll answer me or no; If not, I’ll leave him to the officer.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I answer you? What should I answer you?  ANGELO. The money that you owe me for the chain.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I owe you none till I receive the chain.  ANGELO. You know I gave it you half an hour since.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You gave me none. You wrong me much to say so.  ANGELO. You wrong me more, sir, in denying it. Consider how it stands upon my credit.  MERCHANT. Well, officer, arrest him at my suit.  OFFICER. I do, and charge you in the duke’s name to obey me.  ANGELO. This touches me in reputation. Either consent to pay this sum for me, Or I attach you by this officer.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Consent to pay thee that I never had? Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou dar’st.  ANGELO. Here is thy fee; arrest him, officer. I would not spare my brother in this case If he should scorn me so apparently.  OFFICER. I do arrest you, sir. You hear the suit.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I do obey thee till I give thee bail. But, sirrah, you shall buy this sport as dear As all the metal in your shop will answer.  ANGELO. Sir, sir, I shall have law in Ephesus, To your notorious shame, I doubt it not.   Enter Dromio of Syracuse from the bay.  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, there’s a bark of Epidamnum That stays but till her owner comes aboard, And then, sir, bears away. Our fraughtage, sir, I have convey’d aboard, and I have bought The oil, the balsamum, and aqua-vitae. The ship is in her trim; the merry wind Blows fair from land; they stay for nought at all But for their owner, master, and yourself.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. How now? a madman? Why, thou peevish sheep, What ship of Epidamnum stays for me?  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. A ship you sent me to, to hire waftage.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou drunken slave, I sent thee for a rope, And told thee to what purpose and what end.  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. You sent me for a rope’s end as soon. You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I will debate this matter at more leisure, And teach your ears to list me with more heed. To Adriana, villain, hie thee straight: Give her this key, and tell her in the desk That’s cover’d o’er with Turkish tapestry There is a purse of ducats; let her send it. Tell her I am arrested in the street, And that shall bail me. Hie thee, slave; be gone. On, officer, to prison till it come.   [_Exeunt Merchant, Angelo, Officer and Antipholus of Ephesus._]  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. To Adriana, that is where we din’d, Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband. She is too big, I hope, for me to compass. Thither I must, although against my will, For servants must their masters’ minds fulfil.   [_Exit._]  SCENE II. The same   Enter Adriana and Luciana.  ADRIANA. Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so? Might’st thou perceive austerely in his eye That he did plead in earnest, yea or no? Look’d he or red or pale, or sad or merrily? What observation mad’st thou in this case Of his heart’s meteors tilting in his face?  LUCIANA. First he denied you had in him no right.  ADRIANA. He meant he did me none; the more my spite.  LUCIANA. Then swore he that he was a stranger here.  ADRIANA. And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were.  LUCIANA. Then pleaded I for you.  ADRIANA. And what said he?  LUCIANA. That love I begg’d for you he begg’d of me.  ADRIANA. With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?  LUCIANA. With words that in an honest suit might move. First he did praise my beauty, then my speech.  ADRIANA. Did’st speak him fair?  LUCIANA. Have patience, I beseech.  ADRIANA. I cannot, nor I will not hold me still. My tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will. He is deformed, crooked, old, and sere, Ill-fac’d, worse bodied, shapeless everywhere; Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind, Stigmatical in making, worse in mind.  LUCIANA. Who would be jealous then of such a one? No evil lost is wail’d when it is gone.  ADRIANA. Ah, but I think him better than I say, And yet would herein others’ eyes were worse: Far from her nest the lapwing cries away; My heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.   Enter Dromio of Syracuse.  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Here, go; the desk, the purse, sweet now, make haste.  LUCIANA. How hast thou lost thy breath?  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. By running fast.  ADRIANA. Where is thy master, Dromio? is he well?  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, he’s in Tartar limbo, worse than hell. A devil in an everlasting garment hath him, One whose hard heart is button’d up with steel; A fiend, a fairy, pitiless and rough; A wolf, nay worse, a fellow all in buff; A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that countermands The passages of alleys, creeks, and narrow lands; A hound that runs counter, and yet draws dryfoot well, One that, before the judgement, carries poor souls to hell.  ADRIANA. Why, man, what is the matter?  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I do not know the matter. He is ’rested on the case.  ADRIANA. What, is he arrested? Tell me at whose suit?  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I know not at whose suit he is arrested, well; But he’s in a suit of buff which ’rested him, that can I tell. Will you send him, mistress, redemption, the money in his desk?  ADRIANA. Go fetch it, sister. This I wonder at,   [_Exit Luciana._]  Thus he unknown to me should be in debt. Tell me, was he arrested on a band?  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Not on a band, but on a stronger thing; A chain, a chain. Do you not hear it ring?  ADRIANA. What, the chain?  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, no, the bell, ’tis time that I were gone. It was two ere I left him, and now the clock strikes one.  ADRIANA. The hours come back! That did I never hear.  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. O yes, if any hour meet a sergeant, ’a turns back for very fear.  ADRIANA. As if time were in debt. How fondly dost thou reason!  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Time is a very bankrupt, and owes more than he’s worth to season. Nay, he’s a thief too. Have you not heard men say That time comes stealing on by night and day? If he be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way, Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day?   Enter Luciana.  ADRIANA. Go, Dromio, there’s the money, bear it straight, And bring thy master home immediately. Come, sister, I am press’d down with conceit; Conceit, my comfort and my injury.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. The same   Enter Antipholus of Syracuse.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. There’s not a man I meet but doth salute me As if I were their well-acquainted friend, And everyone doth call me by my name. Some tender money to me, some invite me; Some other give me thanks for kindnesses; Some offer me commodities to buy. Even now a tailor call’d me in his shop, And show’d me silks that he had bought for me, And therewithal took measure of my body. Sure, these are but imaginary wiles, And Lapland sorcerers inhabit here.   Enter Dromio of Syracuse.  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, here’s the gold you sent me for. What, have you got the picture of old Adam new apparelled?  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What gold is this? What Adam dost thou mean?  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Not that Adam that kept the paradise, but that Adam that keeps the prison; he that goes in the calf’s skin that was killed for the Prodigal; he that came behind you, sir, like an evil angel, and bid you forsake your liberty.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I understand thee not.  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No? Why, ’tis a plain case: he that went like a bass-viol in a case of leather; the man, sir, that, when gentlemen are tired, gives them a sob, and ’rests them; he, sir, that takes pity on decayed men and gives them suits of durance; he that sets up his rest to do more exploits with his mace than a morris-pike.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What! thou mean’st an officer?  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Ay, sir, the sergeant of the band; he that brings any man to answer it that breaks his band; one that thinks a man always going to bed, and says, “God give you good rest.”  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, there rest in your foolery. Is there any ship puts forth tonight? may we be gone?  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Why, sir, I brought you word an hour since that the bark _Expedition_ put forth tonight, and then were you hindered by the sergeant to tarry for the hoy _Delay_. Here are the angels that you sent for to deliver you.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. The fellow is distract, and so am I, And here we wander in illusions. Some blessed power deliver us from hence!   Enter a Courtesan.  COURTESAN. Well met, well met, Master Antipholus. I see, sir, you have found the goldsmith now. Is that the chain you promis’d me today?  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Satan, avoid! I charge thee, tempt me not.  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, is this Mistress Satan?  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. It is the devil.  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Nay, she is worse, she is the devil’s dam; and here she comes in the habit of a light wench, and thereof comes that the wenches say “God damn me”, that’s as much to say, “God make me a light wench.” It is written they appear to men like angels of light. Light is an effect of fire, and fire will burn; ergo, light wenches will burn. Come not near her.  COURTESAN. Your man and you are marvellous merry, sir. Will you go with me? We’ll mend our dinner here.  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, if you do, expect spoon-meat, or bespeak a long spoon.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, Dromio?  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, he must have a long spoon that must eat with the devil.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Avoid then, fiend! What tell’st thou me of supping? Thou art, as you are all, a sorceress. I conjure thee to leave me and be gone.  COURTESAN. Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner, Or, for my diamond, the chain you promis’d, And I’ll be gone, sir, and not trouble you.  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Some devils ask but the paring of one’s nail, A rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin, A nut, a cherry-stone; but she, more covetous, Would have a chain. Master, be wise; and if you give it her, The devil will shake her chain and fright us with it.  COURTESAN. I pray you, sir, my ring, or else the chain; I hope you do not mean to cheat me so.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Avaunt, thou witch! Come, Dromio, let us go.  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Fly pride, says the peacock. Mistress, that you know.   [_Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse._]  COURTESAN. Now, out of doubt Antipholus is mad, Else would he never so demean himself. A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats, And for the same he promis’d me a chain; Both one and other he denies me now. The reason that I gather he is mad, Besides this present instance of his rage, Is a mad tale he told today at dinner Of his own doors being shut against his entrance. Belike his wife, acquainted with his fits, On purpose shut the doors against his way. My way is now to hie home to his house, And tell his wife that, being lunatic, He rush’d into my house and took perforce My ring away. This course I fittest choose, For forty ducats is too much to lose.   [_Exit._]  SCENE IV. The same   Enter Antipholus of Ephesus with an Officer.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Fear me not, man, I will not break away: I’ll give thee ere I leave thee so much money, To warrant thee, as I am ’rested for. My wife is in a wayward mood today, And will not lightly trust the messenger That I should be attach’d in Ephesus; I tell you ’twill sound harshly in her ears.   Enter Dromio of Ephesus with a rope’s end.  Here comes my man. I think he brings the money. How now, sir! have you that I sent you for?  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Here’s that, I warrant you, will pay them all.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. But where’s the money?  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Five hundred ducats, villain, for a rope?  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I’ll serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. To a rope’s end, sir; and to that end am I return’d.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And to that end, sir, I will welcome you.   [_Beating him._]  OFFICER. Good sir, be patient.  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Nay, ’tis for me to be patient. I am in adversity.  OFFICER. Good now, hold thy tongue.  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou whoreson, senseless villain.  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I would I were senseless, sir, that I might not feel your blows.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou art sensible in nothing but blows, and so is an ass.  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I am an ass indeed; you may prove it by my long ears. I have served him from the hour of my nativity to this instant, and have nothing at his hands for my service but blows. When I am cold, he heats me with beating; when I am warm he cools me with beating. I am waked with it when I sleep, raised with it when I sit, driven out of doors with it when I go from home, welcomed home with it when I return. Nay, I bear it on my shoulders as a beggar wont her brat; and I think when he hath lamed me, I shall beg with it from door to door.   Enter Adriana, Luciana, Courtesan and a Schoolmaster called Pinch.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Come, go along, my wife is coming yonder.  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Mistress, _respice finem_, respect your end, or rather, the prophesy like the parrot, “Beware the rope’s end.”  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Wilt thou still talk?   [_Beats him._]  COURTESAN. How say you now? Is not your husband mad?  ADRIANA. His incivility confirms no less. Good Doctor Pinch, you are a conjurer; Establish him in his true sense again, And I will please you what you will demand.  LUCIANA. Alas, how fiery and how sharp he looks!  COURTESAN. Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy.  PINCH. Give me your hand, and let me feel your pulse.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There is my hand, and let it feel your ear.  PINCH. I charge thee, Satan, hous’d within this man, To yield possession to my holy prayers, And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight. I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Peace, doting wizard, peace; I am not mad.  ADRIANA. O, that thou wert not, poor distressed soul!  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You minion, you, are these your customers? Did this companion with the saffron face Revel and feast it at my house today, Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut, And I denied to enter in my house?  ADRIANA. O husband, God doth know you din’d at home, Where would you had remain’d until this time, Free from these slanders and this open shame.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Din’d at home? Thou villain, what sayest thou?  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Sir, sooth to say, you did not dine at home.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Were not my doors lock’d up and I shut out?  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Perdy, your doors were lock’d, and you shut out.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And did not she herself revile me there?  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Sans fable, she herself revil’d you there.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt, and scorn me?  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Certes, she did, the kitchen-vestal scorn’d you.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And did not I in rage depart from thence?  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. In verity, you did; my bones bear witness, That since have felt the vigour of his rage.  ADRIANA. Is’t good to soothe him in these contraries?  PINCH. It is no shame; the fellow finds his vein, And yielding to him, humours well his frenzy.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou hast suborn’d the goldsmith to arrest me.  ADRIANA. Alas! I sent you money to redeem you By Dromio here, who came in haste for it.  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Money by me? Heart and goodwill you might, But surely, master, not a rag of money.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Went’st not thou to her for a purse of ducats?  ADRIANA. He came to me, and I deliver’d it.  LUCIANA. And I am witness with her that she did.  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. God and the rope-maker bear me witness That I was sent for nothing but a rope.  PINCH. Mistress, both man and master is possess’d, I know it by their pale and deadly looks. They must be bound and laid in some dark room.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Say, wherefore didst thou lock me forth today, And why dost thou deny the bag of gold?  ADRIANA. I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. And gentle master, I receiv’d no gold; But I confess, sir, that we were lock’d out.  ADRIANA. Dissembling villain, thou speak’st false in both.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all, And art confederate with a damned pack To make a loathsome abject scorn of me. But with these nails I’ll pluck out these false eyes That would behold in me this shameful sport.   [_Enter three or four, and offer to bind him. He strives. _]  ADRIANA. O, bind him, bind him; let him not come near me.  PINCH. More company; the fiend is strong within him.  LUCIANA. Ay me, poor man, how pale and wan he looks!  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. What, will you murder me? Thou jailer, thou, I am thy prisoner. Wilt thou suffer them To make a rescue?  OFFICER. Masters, let him go. He is my prisoner, and you shall not have him.  PINCH. Go, bind this man, for he is frantic too.  ADRIANA. What wilt thou do, thou peevish officer? Hast thou delight to see a wretched man Do outrage and displeasure to himself?  OFFICER. He is my prisoner. If I let him go, The debt he owes will be requir’d of me.  ADRIANA. I will discharge thee ere I go from thee; Bear me forthwith unto his creditor, And knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it. Good master doctor, see him safe convey’d Home to my house. O most unhappy day!  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. O most unhappy strumpet!  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Master, I am here enter’d in bond for you.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Out on thee, villain! wherefore dost thou mad me?  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Will you be bound for nothing? Be mad, good master; cry, “the devil”.  LUCIANA. God help, poor souls, how idly do they talk!  ADRIANA. Go bear him hence. Sister, go you with me.   [_Exeunt Pinch and Assistants, with Antipholus of Ephesus and Dromio  of Ephesus._]  Say now, whose suit is he arrested at?  OFFICER. One Angelo, a goldsmith; do you know him?  ADRIANA. I know the man. What is the sum he owes?  OFFICER. Two hundred ducats.  ADRIANA. Say, how grows it due?  OFFICER. Due for a chain your husband had of him.  ADRIANA. He did bespeak a chain for me, but had it not.  COURTESAN. When as your husband, all in rage, today Came to my house and took away my ring, The ring I saw upon his finger now, Straight after did I meet him with a chain.  ADRIANA. It may be so, but I did never see it. Come, jailer, bring me where the goldsmith is, I long to know the truth hereof at large.   Enter Antipholus of Syracuse with his rapier drawn, and Dromio of  Syracuse.  LUCIANA. God, for thy mercy, they are loose again!  ADRIANA. And come with naked swords. Let’s call more help To have them bound again.  OFFICER. Away, they’ll kill us.   [_Exeunt, as fast as may be, frighted._]  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I see these witches are afraid of swords.  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. She that would be your wife now ran from you.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come to the Centaur, fetch our stuff from thence. I long that we were safe and sound aboard.  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Faith, stay here this night, they will surely do us no harm; you saw they speak us fair, give us gold. Methinks they are such a gentle nation that, but for the mountain of mad flesh that claims marriage of me, I could find in my heart to stay here still and turn witch.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I will not stay tonight for all the town; Therefore away, to get our stuff aboard.   [_Exeunt._]
 ACT V  SCENE I. The same   Enter Merchant and Angelo.  ANGELO. I am sorry, sir, that I have hinder’d you, But I protest he had the chain of me, Though most dishonestly he doth deny it.  MERCHANT. How is the man esteem’d here in the city?  ANGELO. Of very reverend reputation, sir, Of credit infinite, highly belov’d, Second to none that lives here in the city. His word might bear my wealth at any time.  MERCHANT. Speak softly. Yonder, as I think, he walks.   Enter Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse.  ANGELO. ’Tis so; and that self chain about his neck Which he forswore most monstrously to have. Good sir, draw near to me, I’ll speak to him. Signior Antipholus, I wonder much That you would put me to this shame and trouble, And not without some scandal to yourself, With circumstance and oaths so to deny This chain, which now you wear so openly. Beside the charge, the shame, imprisonment, You have done wrong to this my honest friend, Who, but for staying on our controversy, Had hoisted sail and put to sea today. This chain you had of me, can you deny it?  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think I had: I never did deny it.  MERCHANT. Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?  MERCHANT. These ears of mine, thou know’st, did hear thee. Fie on thee, wretch. ’Tis pity that thou liv’st To walk where any honest men resort.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou art a villain to impeach me thus; I’ll prove mine honour and mine honesty Against thee presently, if thou dar’st stand.  MERCHANT. I dare, and do defy thee for a villain.   [_They draw._]   Enter Adriana, Luciana, Courtesan and others.  ADRIANA. Hold, hurt him not, for God’s sake, he is mad. Some get within him, take his sword away. Bind Dromio too, and bear them to my house.  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Run, master, run, for God’s sake, take a house. This is some priory; in, or we are spoil’d.   [_Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse to the  priory._]   Enter Lady Abbess.  ABBESS. Be quiet, people. Wherefore throng you hither?  ADRIANA. To fetch my poor distracted husband hence. Let us come in, that we may bind him fast And bear him home for his recovery.  ANGELO. I knew he was not in his perfect wits.  MERCHANT. I am sorry now that I did draw on him.  ABBESS. How long hath this possession held the man?  ADRIANA. This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad, And much different from the man he was. But till this afternoon his passion Ne’er brake into extremity of rage.  ABBESS. Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea? Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye Stray’d his affection in unlawful love? A sin prevailing much in youthful men Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing? Which of these sorrows is he subject to?  ADRIANA. To none of these, except it be the last, Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.  ABBESS. You should for that have reprehended him.  ADRIANA. Why, so I did.  ABBESS. Ay, but not rough enough.  ADRIANA. As roughly as my modesty would let me.  ABBESS. Haply in private.  ADRIANA. And in assemblies too.  ABBESS. Ay, but not enough.  ADRIANA. It was the copy of our conference. In bed he slept not for my urging it; At board he fed not for my urging it; Alone, it was the subject of my theme; In company I often glanced it; Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.  ABBESS. And thereof came it that the man was mad. The venom clamours of a jealous woman Poisons more deadly than a mad dog’s tooth. It seems his sleeps were hindered by thy railing, And thereof comes it that his head is light. Thou say’st his meat was sauc’d with thy upbraidings. Unquiet meals make ill digestions; Thereof the raging fire of fever bred, And what’s a fever but a fit of madness? Thou say’st his sports were hinder’d by thy brawls. Sweet recreation barr’d, what doth ensue But moody and dull melancholy, Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair, And at her heels a huge infectious troop Of pale distemperatures and foes to life? In food, in sport, and life-preserving rest To be disturb’d would mad or man or beast. The consequence is, then, thy jealous fits Hath scar’d thy husband from the use of’s wits.  LUCIANA. She never reprehended him but mildly, When he demean’d himself rough, rude, and wildly. Why bear you these rebukes and answer not?  ADRIANA. She did betray me to my own reproof. Good people, enter and lay hold on him.  ABBESS. No, not a creature enters in my house.  ADRIANA. Then let your servants bring my husband forth.  ABBESS. Neither. He took this place for sanctuary, And it shall privilege him from your hands Till I have brought him to his wits again, Or lose my labour in assaying it.  ADRIANA. I will attend my husband, be his nurse, Diet his sickness, for it is my office, And will have no attorney but myself; And therefore let me have him home with me.  ABBESS. Be patient, for I will not let him stir Till I have used the approved means I have, With wholesome syrups, drugs, and holy prayers, To make of him a formal man again. It is a branch and parcel of mine oath, A charitable duty of my order; Therefore depart, and leave him here with me.  ADRIANA. I will not hence and leave my husband here; And ill it doth beseem your holiness To separate the husband and the wife.  ABBESS. Be quiet and depart. Thou shalt not have him.   [_Exit Abbess._]  LUCIANA. Complain unto the duke of this indignity.  ADRIANA. Come, go. I will fall prostrate at his feet, And never rise until my tears and prayers Have won his grace to come in person hither And take perforce my husband from the abbess.  MERCHANT. By this, I think, the dial points at five. Anon, I’m sure, the Duke himself in person Comes this way to the melancholy vale, The place of death and sorry execution Behind the ditches of the abbey here.  ANGELO. Upon what cause?  MERCHANT. To see a reverend Syracusian merchant, Who put unluckily into this bay Against the laws and statutes of this town, Beheaded publicly for his offence.  ANGELO. See where they come. We will behold his death.  LUCIANA. Kneel to the Duke before he pass the abbey.   Enter the Duke, attended; Egeon, bareheaded; with the Headsman and  other Officers.  DUKE. Yet once again proclaim it publicly, If any friend will pay the sum for him, He shall not die; so much we tender him.  ADRIANA. Justice, most sacred duke, against the abbess!  DUKE. She is a virtuous and a reverend lady, It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.  ADRIANA. May it please your grace, Antipholus, my husband, Who I made lord of me and all I had At your important letters, this ill day A most outrageous fit of madness took him; That desp’rately he hurried through the street, With him his bondman all as mad as he, Doing displeasure to the citizens By rushing in their houses, bearing thence Rings, jewels, anything his rage did like. Once did I get him bound and sent him home, Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went, That here and there his fury had committed. Anon, I wot not by what strong escape, He broke from those that had the guard of him, And with his mad attendant and himself, Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords, Met us again, and, madly bent on us, Chased us away; till raising of more aid, We came again to bind them. Then they fled Into this abbey, whither we pursued them. And here the abbess shuts the gates on us, And will not suffer us to fetch him out, Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence. Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.  DUKE. Long since thy husband serv’d me in my wars, And I to thee engag’d a prince’s word, When thou didst make him master of thy bed, To do him all the grace and good I could. Go, some of you, knock at the abbey gate, And bid the lady abbess come to me. I will determine this before I stir.   Enter a Messenger.  MESSENGER. O mistress, mistress, shift and save yourself. My master and his man are both broke loose, Beaten the maids a-row, and bound the doctor, Whose beard they have singed off with brands of fire, And ever as it blazed they threw on him Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair. My master preaches patience to him, and the while His man with scissors nicks him like a fool; And sure (unless you send some present help) Between them they will kill the conjurer.  ADRIANA. Peace, fool, thy master and his man are here, And that is false thou dost report to us.  MESSENGER. Mistress, upon my life, I tell you true. I have not breath’d almost since I did see it. He cries for you, and vows, if he can take you, To scorch your face and to disfigure you.   [_Cry within._]  Hark, hark, I hear him, mistress. Fly, be gone!  DUKE. Come, stand by me, fear nothing. Guard with halberds.  ADRIANA. Ay me, it is my husband. Witness you That he is borne about invisible. Even now we hous’d him in the abbey here, And now he’s there, past thought of human reason.   Enter Antipholus and Dromio of Ephesus.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Justice, most gracious duke; O, grant me justice! Even for the service that long since I did thee When I bestrid thee in the wars, and took Deep scars to save thy life; even for the blood That then I lost for thee, now grant me justice.  EGEON. Unless the fear of death doth make me dote, I see my son Antipholus and Dromio.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Justice, sweet prince, against that woman there. She whom thou gav’st to me to be my wife; That hath abused and dishonour’d me Even in the strength and height of injury. Beyond imagination is the wrong That she this day hath shameless thrown on me.  DUKE. Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. This day, great duke, she shut the doors upon me While she with harlots feasted in my house.  DUKE. A grievous fault. Say, woman, didst thou so?  ADRIANA. No, my good lord. Myself, he, and my sister Today did dine together. So befall my soul As this is false he burdens me withal.  LUCIANA. Ne’er may I look on day nor sleep on night But she tells to your highness simple truth.  ANGELO. O perjur’d woman! They are both forsworn. In this the madman justly chargeth them.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. My liege, I am advised what I say, Neither disturb’d with the effect of wine, Nor heady-rash, provok’d with raging ire, Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad. This woman lock’d me out this day from dinner. That goldsmith there, were he not pack’d with her, Could witness it, for he was with me then, Who parted with me to go fetch a chain, Promising to bring it to the Porpentine, Where Balthasar and I did dine together. Our dinner done, and he not coming thither, I went to seek him. In the street I met him, And in his company that gentleman. There did this perjur’d goldsmith swear me down That I this day of him receiv’d the chain, Which, God he knows, I saw not. For the which He did arrest me with an officer. I did obey, and sent my peasant home For certain ducats. He with none return’d. Then fairly I bespoke the officer To go in person with me to my house. By th’ way we met My wife, her sister, and a rabble more Of vile confederates. Along with them They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-faced villain, A mere anatomy, a mountebank, A threadbare juggler, and a fortune-teller; A needy, hollow-ey’d, sharp-looking wretch; A living dead man. This pernicious slave, Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer, And gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse, And with no face (as ’twere) outfacing me, Cries out, I was possess’d. Then altogether They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence, And in a dark and dankish vault at home There left me and my man, both bound together, Till gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder, I gain’d my freedom and immediately Ran hither to your Grace, whom I beseech To give me ample satisfaction For these deep shames and great indignities.  ANGELO. My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him, That he din’d not at home, but was lock’d out.  DUKE. But had he such a chain of thee, or no?  ANGELO. He had, my lord, and when he ran in here These people saw the chain about his neck.  MERCHANT. Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine Heard you confess you had the chain of him, After you first forswore it on the mart, And thereupon I drew my sword on you; And then you fled into this abbey here, From whence I think you are come by miracle.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never came within these abbey walls, Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me. I never saw the chain, so help me heaven; And this is false you burden me withal.  DUKE. Why, what an intricate impeach is this! I think you all have drunk of Circe’s cup. If here you hous’d him, here he would have been. If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly. You say he din’d at home, the goldsmith here Denies that saying. Sirrah, what say you?  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Sir, he dined with her there, at the Porpentine.  COURTESAN. He did, and from my finger snatch’d that ring.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. ’Tis true, my liege, this ring I had of her.  DUKE. Saw’st thou him enter at the abbey here?  COURTESAN. As sure, my liege, as I do see your grace.  DUKE. Why, this is strange. Go call the abbess hither. I think you are all mated, or stark mad.   [_Exit one to the Abbess._]  EGEON. Most mighty Duke, vouchsafe me speak a word; Haply I see a friend will save my life And pay the sum that may deliver me.  DUKE. Speak freely, Syracusian, what thou wilt.  EGEON. Is not your name, sir, call’d Antipholus? And is not that your bondman Dromio?  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Within this hour I was his bondman, sir, But he, I thank him, gnaw’d in two my cords. Now am I Dromio, and his man, unbound.  EGEON. I am sure you both of you remember me.  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you. For lately we were bound as you are now. You are not Pinch’s patient, are you, sir?  EGEON. Why look you strange on me? you know me well.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never saw you in my life till now.  EGEON. O! grief hath chang’d me since you saw me last, And careful hours with time’s deformed hand, Have written strange defeatures in my face. But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Neither.  EGEON. Dromio, nor thou?  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. No, trust me, sir, nor I.  EGEON. I am sure thou dost.  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Ay, sir, but I am sure I do not, and whatsoever a man denies, you are now bound to believe him.  EGEON. Not know my voice! O time’s extremity, Hast thou so crack’d and splitted my poor tongue In seven short years that here my only son Knows not my feeble key of untun’d cares? Though now this grained face of mine be hid In sap-consuming winter’s drizzled snow, And all the conduits of my blood froze up, Yet hath my night of life some memory, My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left, My dull deaf ears a little use to hear. All these old witnesses, I cannot err, Tell me thou art my son Antipholus.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never saw my father in my life.  EGEON. But seven years since, in Syracusa, boy, Thou know’st we parted; but perhaps, my son, Thou sham’st to acknowledge me in misery.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. The duke and all that know me in the city, Can witness with me that it is not so. I ne’er saw Syracusa in my life.  DUKE. I tell thee, Syracusian, twenty years Have I been patron to Antipholus, During which time he ne’er saw Syracusa. I see thy age and dangers make thee dote.   Enter the Abbess with Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse.  ABBESS. Most mighty duke, behold a man much wrong’d.   [_All gather to see them._]  ADRIANA. I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.  DUKE. One of these men is _genius_ to the other; And so of these, which is the natural man, And which the spirit? Who deciphers them?  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I, sir, am Dromio, command him away.  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I, sir, am Dromio, pray let me stay.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Egeon, art thou not? or else his ghost?  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. O, my old master, who hath bound him here?  ABBESS. Whoever bound him, I will loose his bonds, And gain a husband by his liberty. Speak, old Egeon, if thou be’st the man That hadst a wife once called Emilia, That bore thee at a burden two fair sons. O, if thou be’st the same Egeon, speak, And speak unto the same Emilia!  DUKE. Why, here begins his morning story right: These two Antipholus’, these two so like, And these two Dromios, one in semblance, Besides her urging of her wreck at sea. These are the parents to these children, Which accidentally are met together.  EGEON. If I dream not, thou art Emilia. If thou art she, tell me where is that son That floated with thee on the fatal raft?  ABBESS. By men of Epidamnum, he and I And the twin Dromio, all were taken up; But, by and by, rude fishermen of Corinth By force took Dromio and my son from them, And me they left with those of Epidamnum. What then became of them I cannot tell; I to this fortune that you see me in.  DUKE. Antipholus, thou cam’st from Corinth first?  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. No, sir, not I, I came from Syracuse.  DUKE. Stay, stand apart, I know not which is which.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord.  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. And I with him.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Brought to this town by that most famous warrior, Duke Menaphon, your most renowned uncle.  ADRIANA. Which of you two did dine with me today?  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I, gentle mistress.  ADRIANA. And are not you my husband?  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. No, I say nay to that.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. And so do I, yet did she call me so; And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here, Did call me brother. What I told you then, I hope I shall have leisure to make good, If this be not a dream I see and hear.  ANGELO. That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think it be, sir. I deny it not.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And you, sir, for this chain arrested me.  ANGELO. I think I did, sir. I deny it not.  ADRIANA. I sent you money, sir, to be your bail By Dromio, but I think he brought it not.  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. No, none by me.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. This purse of ducats I receiv’d from you, And Dromio my man did bring them me. I see we still did meet each other’s man, And I was ta’en for him, and he for me, And thereupon these errors are arose.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. These ducats pawn I for my father here.  DUKE. It shall not need, thy father hath his life.  COURTESAN. Sir, I must have that diamond from you.  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There, take it, and much thanks for my good cheer.  ABBESS. Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains To go with us into the abbey here, And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes; And all that are assembled in this place, That by this sympathised one day’s error Have suffer’d wrong, go, keep us company, And we shall make full satisfaction. Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail Of you, my sons, and till this present hour My heavy burden ne’er delivered. The duke, my husband, and my children both, And you, the calendars of their nativity, Go to a gossips’ feast, and go with me. After so long grief, such nativity.  DUKE. With all my heart, I’ll gossip at this feast.   [_Exeunt except the two Dromios and two Brothers._]  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, shall I fetch your stuff from shipboard?  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embark’d?  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Your goods that lay at host, sir, in the Centaur.  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. He speaks to me; I am your master, Dromio. Come, go with us. We’ll look to that anon. Embrace thy brother there, rejoice with him.   [_Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Antipholus of Ephesus._]  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. There is a fat friend at your master’s house, That kitchen’d me for you today at dinner. She now shall be my sister, not my wife.  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Methinks you are my glass, and not my brother. I see by you I am a sweet-faced youth. Will you walk in to see their gossiping?  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Not I, sir, you are my elder.  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. That’s a question, how shall we try it?  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. We’ll draw cuts for the senior. Till then, lead thou first.  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Nay, then, thus: We came into the world like brother and brother, And now let’s go hand in hand, not one before another.   [_Exeunt._]

  ACT I  SCENE I. Rome. A street
  ACT II  SCENE I. Rome. A public place
Enter Menenius with the two Tribunes of the people, Sicinius and Brutus.  MENENIUS. The augurer tells me we shall have news tonight.  BRUTUS. Good or bad?  MENENIUS. Not according to the prayer of the people, for they love not Martius.  SICINIUS. Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.  MENENIUS. Pray you, who does the wolf love?  SICINIUS. The lamb.  MENENIUS. Ay, to devour him, as the hungry plebeians would the noble Martius.  BRUTUS. He’s a lamb indeed, that baas like a bear.  MENENIUS. He’s a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb. You two are old men; tell me one thing that I shall ask you.  BOTH TRIBUNES. Well, sir.  MENENIUS. In what enormity is Martius poor in, that you two have not in abundance?  BRUTUS. He’s poor in no one fault, but stored with all.  SICINIUS. Especially in pride.  BRUTUS. And topping all others in boasting.  MENENIUS. This is strange now. Do you two know how you are censured here in the city, I mean of us o’ th’ right-hand file, do you?  BOTH TRIBUNES. Why, how are we censured?  MENENIUS. Because you talk of pride now, will you not be angry?  BOTH TRIBUNES. Well, well, sir, well?  MENENIUS. Why, ’tis no great matter; for a very little thief of occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience. Give your dispositions the reins, and be angry at your pleasures, at the least, if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so. You blame Martius for being proud.  BRUTUS. We do it not alone, sir.  MENENIUS. I know you can do very little alone, for your helps are many, or else your actions would grow wondrous single. Your abilities are too infantlike for doing much alone. You talk of pride. O that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks and make but an interior survey of your good selves! O, that you could!  BOTH TRIBUNES. What then, sir?  MENENIUS. Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting, proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as any in Rome.  SICINIUS. Menenius, you are known well enough, too.  MENENIUS. I am known to be a humorous patrician and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying Tiber in’t; said to be something imperfect in favouring the first complaint, hasty and tinder-like upon too trivial motion; one that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning. What I think I utter, and spend my malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as you are—I cannot call you Lycurguses—if the drink you give me touch my palate adversely, I make a crooked face at it. I cannot say your Worships have delivered the matter well when I find the ass in compound with the major part of your syllables. And though I must be content to bear with those that say you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that tell you have good faces. If you see this in the map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known well enough too? What harm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this character, if I be known well enough, too?  BRUTUS. Come, sir, come; we know you well enough.  MENENIUS. You know neither me, yourselves, nor anything. You are ambitious for poor knaves’ caps and legs. You wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orange-wife and a faucet-seller, and then rejourn the controversy of threepence to a second day of audience. When you are hearing a matter between party and party, if you chance to be pinched with the colic, you make faces like mummers, set up the bloody flag against all patience, and, in roaring for a chamber pot, dismiss the controversy bleeding, the more entangled by your hearing. All the peace you make in their cause is calling both the parties knaves. You are a pair of strange ones.  BRUTUS. Come, come. You are well understood to be a perfecter giber for the table than a necessary bencher in the Capitol.  MENENIUS. Our very priests must become mockers if they shall encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the wagging of your beards, and your beards deserve not so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher’s cushion or to be entombed in an ass’s packsaddle. Yet you must be saying Martius is proud, who, in a cheap estimation, is worth all your predecessors since Deucalion, though peradventure some of the best of ’em were hereditary hangmen. Good e’en to your Worships. More of your conversation would infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians. I will be bold to take my leave of you.  [_He begins to exit. Brutus and Sicinius stand aside._]  Enter Volumnia, Virgilia and Valeria  How now, my as fair as noble ladies—and the moon, were she earthly, no nobler—whither do you follow your eyes so fast?  VOLUMNIA. Honourable Menenius, my boy Martius approaches. For the love of Juno, let’s go!  MENENIUS. Ha? Martius coming home?  VOLUMNIA. Ay, worthy Menenius, and with most prosperous approbation.  MENENIUS. Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee! Hoo! Martius coming home?  VALERIA, VIRGILIA. Nay, ’tis true.  VOLUMNIA. Look, here’s a letter from him. The state hath another, his wife another, and I think there’s one at home for you.  MENENIUS. I will make my very house reel tonight. A letter for me?  VIRGILIA. Yes, certain, there’s a letter for you; I saw it.  MENENIUS. A letter for me? It gives me an estate of seven years’ health, in which time I will make a lip at the physician. The most sovereign prescription in Galen is but empiricutic and, to this preservative, of no better report than a horse drench. Is he not wounded? He was wont to come home wounded.  VIRGILIA. O, no, no, no!  VOLUMNIA. O, he is wounded, I thank the gods for’t.  MENENIUS. So do I too, if it be not too much. Brings he victory in his pocket, the wounds become him.  VOLUMNIA. On’s brows, Menenius. He comes the third time home with the oaken garland.  MENENIUS. Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?  VOLUMNIA. Titus Lartius writes they fought together, but Aufidius got off.  MENENIUS. And ’twas time for him too, I’ll warrant him that. An he had stayed by him, I would not have been so ’fidiused for all the chests in Corioles and the gold that’s in them. Is the Senate possessed of this?  VOLUMNIA. Good ladies, let’s go.—Yes, yes, yes. The Senate has letters from the General, wherein he gives my son the whole name of the war. He hath in this action outdone his former deeds doubly.  VALERIA. In troth, there’s wondrous things spoke of him.  MENENIUS. Wondrous? Ay, I warrant you, and not without his true purchasing.  VIRGILIA. The gods grant them true.  VOLUMNIA. True? Pow, waw!  MENENIUS. True? I’ll be sworn they are true. Where is he wounded? [_To the Tribunes_.] God save your good Worships! Martius is coming home; he has more cause to be proud.—Where is he wounded?  VOLUMNIA. I’ th’ shoulder and i’ th’ left arm. There will be large cicatrices to show the people when he shall stand for his place. He received in the repulse of Tarquin seven hurts i’ th’ body.  MENENIUS. One i’ th’ neck and two i’ th’ thigh—there’s nine that I know.  VOLUMNIA. He had, before this last expedition, twenty-five wounds upon him.  MENENIUS. Now it’s twenty-seven. Every gash was an enemy’s grave.
Enter three Citizens more.  Here come more voices. Your voices! For your voices I have fought; Watched for your voices; for your voices bear Of wounds two dozen odd. Battles thrice six I have seen and heard of; for your voices have Done many things, some less, some more. Your voices! Indeed, I would be consul.  SIXTH CITIZEN. He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest man’s voice.  SEVENTH CITIZEN. Therefore let him be consul. The gods give him joy, and make him good friend to the people!  ALL THREE CITIZENS. Amen, amen. God save thee, noble consul.  [_Exeunt citizens._]  CORIOLANUS. Worthy voices!  Enter Menenius with Brutus and Sicinius.  MENENIUS. You have stood your limitation, and the Tribunes Endue you with the people’s voice. Remains That in th’ official marks invested, you Anon do meet the Senate.  CORIOLANUS. Is this done?  SICINIUS. The custom of request you have discharged. The people do admit you, and are summoned To meet anon upon your approbation.  CORIOLANUS. Where? At the Senate House?  SICINIUS. There, Coriolanus.  CORIOLANUS. May I change these garments?  SICINIUS. You may, sir.  CORIOLANUS. That I’ll straight do and, knowing myself again, Repair to th’ Senate House.  MENENIUS. I’ll keep you company.—Will you along?  BRUTUS. We stay here for the people.  SICINIUS. Fare you well.  [_Exeunt Coriolanus and Menenius._]  He has it now; and by his looks, methinks, ’Tis warm at his heart.  BRUTUS. With a proud heart he wore His humble weeds. Will you dismiss the people?  Enter the Pebleians.  SICINIUS. How now, my masters, have you chose this man?  FIRST CITIZEN. He has our voices, sir.  BRUTUS. We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.  SECOND CITIZEN. Amen, sir. To my poor unworthy notice, He mocked us when he begged our voices.  THIRD CITIZEN. Certainly, he flouted us downright.  FIRST CITIZEN. No, ’tis his kind of speech. He did not mock us.  SECOND CITIZEN. Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says He used us scornfully. He should have showed us His marks of merit, wounds received for’s country.  SICINIUS. Why, so he did, I am sure.  ALL. No, no. No man saw ’em.  THIRD CITIZEN. He said he had wounds, which he could show in private, And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn, “I would be consul,” says he; “aged custom, But by your voices, will not so permit me; Your voices therefore.” When we granted that, Here was “I thank you for your voices. Thank you. Your most sweet voices! Now you have left your voices, I have no further with you.” Was not this mockery?  SICINIUS. Why either were you ignorant to see’t Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness To yield your voices?  BRUTUS. Could you not have told him As you were lessoned? When he had no power, But was a petty servant to the state, He was your enemy, ever spake against Your liberties and the charters that you bear I’ th’ body of the weal; and, now arriving A place of potency and sway o’ th’ state, If he should still malignantly remain Fast foe to th’ plebeii, your voices might Be curses to yourselves. You should have said That as his worthy deeds did claim no less Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature Would think upon you for your voices, and Translate his malice towards you into love, Standing your friendly lord.  SICINIUS. Thus to have said, As you were fore-advised, had touched his spirit And tried his inclination; from him plucked Either his gracious promise, which you might, As cause had called you up, have held him to; Or else it would have galled his surly nature, Which easily endures not article Tying him to aught. So putting him to rage, You should have ta’en th’ advantage of his choler And passed him unelected.  BRUTUS. Did you perceive He did solicit you in free contempt When he did need your loves, and do you think That his contempt shall not be bruising to you When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies No heart among you? Or had you tongues to cry Against the rectorship of judgment?  SICINIUS. Have you ere now denied the asker, and now Again, of him that did not ask but mock, Bestow your sued-for tongues?  THIRD CITIZEN. He’s not confirmed. We may deny him yet.  SECOND CITIZEN. And will deny him. I’ll have five hundred voices of that sound.  FIRST CITIZEN. I twice five hundred, and their friends to piece ’em.  BRUTUS. Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends They have chose a consul that will from them take Their liberties, make them of no more voice Than dogs that are as often beat for barking As therefore kept to do so.  SICINIUS. Let them assemble And, on a safer judgment, all revoke Your ignorant election. Enforce his pride And his old hate unto you. Besides, forget not With what contempt he wore the humble weed, How in his suit he scorned you; but your loves, Thinking upon his services, took from you Th’ apprehension of his present portance, Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion After the inveterate hate he bears you.  BRUTUS. Lay A fault on us, your tribunes, that we laboured, No impediment between, but that you must Cast your election on him.  SICINIUS. Say you chose him More after our commandment than as guided By your own true affections, and that your minds, Preoccupied with what you rather must do Than what you should, made you against the grain To voice him consul. Lay the fault on us.  BRUTUS. Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you, How youngly he began to serve his country, How long continued, and what stock he springs of, The noble house o’ th’ Martians, from whence came That Ancus Martius, Numa’s daughter’s son, Who, after great Hostilius here was king, Of the same house Publius and Quintus were, That our best water brought by conduits hither; And Censorinus, that was so surnamed, And nobly named so, twice being censor, Was his great ancestor.  SICINIUS. One thus descended, That hath beside well in his person wrought To be set high in place, we did commend To your remembrances; but you have found, Scaling his present bearing with his past, That he’s your fixed enemy, and revoke Your sudden approbation.  BRUTUS. Say you ne’er had done’t— Harp on that still—but by our putting on. And presently when you have drawn your number, Repair to th’ Capitol.  ALL. We will so. Almost all Repent in their election.  [_Exeunt Plebeians._]  BRUTUS. Let them go on. This mutiny were better put in hazard Than stay, past doubt, for greater. If, as his nature is, he fall in rage With their refusal, both observe and answer The vantage of his anger.  SICINIUS. To th’ Capitol, come. We will be there before the stream o’ th’ people, And this shall seem, as partly ’tis, their own, Which we have goaded onward.  [_Exeunt._]

[_Draw the Conspirators, and kills Martius, who falls. Aufidius stands on him._]  LORDS. Hold, hold, hold, hold!  AUFIDIUS. My noble masters, hear me speak.  FIRST LORD. O Tullus!  SECOND LORD. Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep.  THIRD LORD. Tread not upon him.—Masters, all be quiet.— Put up your swords.  AUFIDIUS. My lords, when you shall know—as in this rage, Provoked by him, you cannot—the great danger Which this man’s life did owe you, you’ll rejoice That he is thus cut off. Please it your Honours To call me to your senate, I’ll deliver Myself your loyal servant, or endure Your heaviest censure.  FIRST LORD. Bear from hence his body, And mourn you for him. Let him be regarded As the most noble corse that ever herald Did follow to his urn.  SECOND LORD. His own impatience Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame. Let’s make the best of it.  AUFIDIUS. My rage is gone, And I am struck with sorrow.—Take him up. Help, three o’ th’ chiefest soldiers; I’ll be one.— Beat thou the drum that it speak mournfully.— Trail your steel pikes. Though in this city he Hath widowed and unchilded many a one, Which to this hour bewail the injury, Yet he shall have a noble memory. Assist.  [_Exeunt, bearing the body of Martius. A dead march sounded._]

  Dramatis Personæ  CYMBELINE, King of Britain CLOTEN, son to the Queen by a former husband POSTHUMUS LEONATUS, a gentleman, husband to Imogen BELARIUS, a banished lord, disguised under the name of Morgan GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS, sons to Cymbeline, disguised under the names of POLYDORE and CADWAL, supposed sons to Belarius PHILARIO, Italian, friend to Posthumus IACHIMO, Italian, friend to Philario CAIUS LUCIUS, General of the Roman forces PISANIO, servant to Posthumus CORNELIUS, a physician A SOOTHSAYER A ROMAN CAPTAIN TWO BRITISH CAPTAINS A FRENCH GENTLEMAN, friend to Philario TWO LORDS of Cymbeline’s court TWO GENTLEMEN of the same TWO GAOLERS  QUEEN, wife to Cymbeline IMOGEN, daughter to Cymbeline by a former queen HELEN, a lady attending on Imogen  APPARITIONS  Lords, Ladies, Roman Senators, Tribunes, a Dutch Gentleman, a Spanish Gentleman, Musicians, Officers, Captains, Soldiers, Messengers, and Attendants  SCENE: Britain; Italy.
  ACT I  SCENE I. Britain. The garden of Cymbeline’s palace.
 Enter two Gentlemen.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. You do not meet a man but frowns; our bloods No more obey the heavens than our courtiers Still seem as does the King’s.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. But what’s the matter?  FIRST GENTLEMAN. His daughter, and the heir of’s kingdom, whom He purpos’d to his wife’s sole son—a widow That late he married—hath referr’d herself Unto a poor but worthy gentleman. She’s wedded; Her husband banish’d; she imprison’d. All Is outward sorrow, though I think the King Be touch’d at very heart.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. None but the King?  FIRST GENTLEMAN. He that hath lost her too. So is the Queen, That most desir’d the match. But not a courtier, Although they wear their faces to the bent Of the King’s looks, hath a heart that is not Glad at the thing they scowl at.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. And why so?  FIRST GENTLEMAN. He that hath miss’d the Princess is a thing Too bad for bad report; and he that hath her— I mean that married her, alack, good man! And therefore banish’d—is a creature such As, to seek through the regions of the earth For one his like, there would be something failing In him that should compare. I do not think So fair an outward and such stuff within Endows a man but he.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. You speak him far.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. I do extend him, sir, within himself; Crush him together rather than unfold His measure duly.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. What’s his name and birth?  FIRST GENTLEMAN. I cannot delve him to the root; his father Was call’d Sicilius, who did join his honour Against the Romans with Cassibelan, But had his titles by Tenantius, whom He serv’d with glory and admir’d success, So gain’d the sur-addition Leonatus; And had, besides this gentleman in question, Two other sons, who, in the wars o’ th’ time, Died with their swords in hand; for which their father, Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow That he quit being; and his gentle lady, Big of this gentleman, our theme, deceas’d As he was born. The King he takes the babe To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus, Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber, Puts to him all the learnings that his time Could make him the receiver of; which he took, As we do air, fast as ’twas minist’red, And in’s spring became a harvest, liv’d in court— Which rare it is to do—most prais’d, most lov’d, A sample to the youngest; to th’ more mature A glass that feated them; and to the graver A child that guided dotards. To his mistress, For whom he now is banish’d, her own price Proclaims how she esteem’d him and his virtue; By her election may be truly read What kind of man he is.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. I honour him Even out of your report. But pray you tell me, Is she sole child to th’ King?  FIRST GENTLEMAN. His only child. He had two sons—if this be worth your hearing, Mark it—the eldest of them at three years old, I’ th’ swathing clothes the other, from their nursery Were stol’n; and to this hour no guess in knowledge Which way they went.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. How long is this ago?  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Some twenty years.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. That a king’s children should be so convey’d, So slackly guarded, and the search so slow That could not trace them!  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Howsoe’er ’tis strange, Or that the negligence may well be laugh’d at, Yet is it true, sir.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. I do well believe you.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. We must forbear; here comes the gentleman, The Queen, and Princess.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. The same.   Enter Queen, Posthumus and Imogen.  QUEEN. No, be assur’d you shall not find me, daughter, After the slander of most stepmothers, Evil-ey’d unto you. You’re my prisoner, but Your gaoler shall deliver you the keys That lock up your restraint. For you, Posthumus, So soon as I can win th’ offended King, I will be known your advocate. Marry, yet The fire of rage is in him, and ’twere good You lean’d unto his sentence with what patience Your wisdom may inform you.  POSTHUMUS. Please your Highness, I will from hence today.  QUEEN. You know the peril. I’ll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying The pangs of barr’d affections, though the King Hath charg’d you should not speak together.   [_Exit._]  IMOGEN. O dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant Can tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband, I something fear my father’s wrath, but nothing (Always reserv’d my holy duty) what His rage can do on me. You must be gone; And I shall here abide the hourly shot Of angry eyes, not comforted to live But that there is this jewel in the world That I may see again.  POSTHUMUS. My queen! my mistress! O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause To be suspected of more tenderness Than doth become a man. I will remain The loyal’st husband that did e’er plight troth; My residence in Rome at one Philario’s, Who to my father was a friend, to me Known but by letter; thither write, my queen, And with mine eyes I’ll drink the words you send, Though ink be made of gall.   Enter Queen.  QUEEN. Be brief, I pray you. If the King come, I shall incur I know not How much of his displeasure. [_Aside._] Yet I’ll move him To walk this way. I never do him wrong But he does buy my injuries, to be friends; Pays dear for my offences.   [_Exit._]  POSTHUMUS. Should we be taking leave As long a term as yet we have to live, The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu!  IMOGEN. Nay, stay a little. Were you but riding forth to air yourself, Such parting were too petty. Look here, love: This diamond was my mother’s; take it, heart; But keep it till you woo another wife, When Imogen is dead.  POSTHUMUS. How, how? Another? You gentle gods, give me but this I have, And sear up my embracements from a next With bonds of death! Remain, remain thou here   [_Puts on the ring._]  While sense can keep it on. And, sweetest, fairest, As I my poor self did exchange for you, To your so infinite loss, so in our trifles I still win of you. For my sake wear this; It is a manacle of love; I’ll place it Upon this fairest prisoner.   [_Puts a bracelet on her arm._]  IMOGEN. O the gods! When shall we see again?   Enter Cymbeline and Lords.  POSTHUMUS. Alack, the King!  CYMBELINE. Thou basest thing, avoid; hence from my sight If after this command thou fraught the court With thy unworthiness, thou diest. Away! Thou’rt poison to my blood.  POSTHUMUS. The gods protect you, And bless the good remainders of the court! I am gone.   [_Exit._]  IMOGEN. There cannot be a pinch in death More sharp than this is.  CYMBELINE. O disloyal thing, That shouldst repair my youth, thou heap’st A year’s age on me!  IMOGEN. I beseech you, sir, Harm not yourself with your vexation. I am senseless of your wrath; a touch more rare Subdues all pangs, all fears.  CYMBELINE. Past grace? obedience?  IMOGEN. Past hope, and in despair; that way past grace.  CYMBELINE. That mightst have had the sole son of my queen!  IMOGEN. O blessed that I might not! I chose an eagle, And did avoid a puttock.  CYMBELINE. Thou took’st a beggar, wouldst have made my throne A seat for baseness.  IMOGEN. No; I rather added A lustre to it.  CYMBELINE. O thou vile one!  IMOGEN. Sir, It is your fault that I have lov’d Posthumus. You bred him as my playfellow, and he is A man worth any woman; overbuys me Almost the sum he pays.  CYMBELINE. What, art thou mad?  IMOGEN. Almost, sir. Heaven restore me! Would I were A neat-herd’s daughter, and my Leonatus Our neighbour shepherd’s son!   Enter Queen.  CYMBELINE. Thou foolish thing! [_To the Queen._] They were again together. You have done Not after our command. Away with her, And pen her up.  QUEEN. Beseech your patience. Peace, Dear lady daughter, peace!—Sweet sovereign, Leave us to ourselves, and make yourself some comfort Out of your best advice.  CYMBELINE. Nay, let her languish A drop of blood a day and, being aged, Die of this folly.   [_Exit with Lords._]   Enter Pisanio.  QUEEN. Fie! you must give way. Here is your servant. How now, sir! What news?  PISANIO. My lord your son drew on my master.  QUEEN. Ha! No harm, I trust, is done?  PISANIO. There might have been, But that my master rather play’d than fought, And had no help of anger; they were parted By gentlemen at hand.  QUEEN. I am very glad on’t.  IMOGEN. Your son’s my father’s friend; he takes his part To draw upon an exile! O brave sir! I would they were in Afric both together; Myself by with a needle, that I might prick The goer-back. Why came you from your master?  PISANIO. On his command. He would not suffer me To bring him to the haven; left these notes Of what commands I should be subject to, When’t pleas’d you to employ me.  QUEEN. This hath been Your faithful servant. I dare lay mine honour He will remain so.  PISANIO. I humbly thank your Highness.  QUEEN. Pray walk awhile.  IMOGEN. About some half-hour hence, Pray you speak with me. You shall at least go see my lord aboard. For this time leave me.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. Britain. A public place.   Enter Cloten and two Lords.  FIRST LORD. Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt; the violence of action hath made you reek as a sacrifice. Where air comes out, air comes in; there’s none abroad so wholesome as that you vent.  CLOTEN. If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it. Have I hurt him?  SECOND LORD. [_Aside._] No, faith; not so much as his patience.  FIRST LORD. Hurt him! His body’s a passable carcass if he be not hurt. It is a throughfare for steel if it be not hurt.  SECOND LORD. [_Aside._] His steel was in debt; it went o’ th’ backside the town.  CLOTEN. The villain would not stand me.  SECOND LORD. [_Aside._] No; but he fled forward still, toward your face.  FIRST LORD. Stand you? You have land enough of your own; but he added to your having, gave you some ground.  SECOND LORD. [_Aside._] As many inches as you have oceans. Puppies!  CLOTEN. I would they had not come between us.  SECOND LORD. [_Aside._] So would I, till you had measur’d how long a fool you were upon the ground.  CLOTEN. And that she should love this fellow, and refuse me!  SECOND LORD. [_Aside._] If it be a sin to make a true election, she is damn’d.  FIRST LORD. Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and her brain go not together; she’s a good sign, but I have seen small reflection of her wit.  SECOND LORD. [_Aside._] She shines not upon fools, lest the reflection should hurt her.  CLOTEN. Come, I’ll to my chamber. Would there had been some hurt done!  SECOND LORD. [_Aside._] I wish not so; unless it had been the fall of an ass, which is no great hurt.  CLOTEN. You’ll go with us?  FIRST LORD. I’ll attend your lordship.  CLOTEN. Nay, come, let’s go together.  SECOND LORD. Well, my lord.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IV. Britain. Cymbeline’s palace.   Enter Imogen and Pisanio.  IMOGEN. I would thou grew’st unto the shores o’ th’ haven, And questioned’st every sail; if he should write, And I not have it, ’twere a paper lost, As offer’d mercy is. What was the last That he spake to thee?  PISANIO. It was: his queen, his queen!  IMOGEN. Then wav’d his handkerchief?  PISANIO. And kiss’d it, madam.  IMOGEN. Senseless linen, happier therein than I! And that was all?  PISANIO. No, madam; for so long As he could make me with his eye, or ear Distinguish him from others, he did keep The deck, with glove, or hat, or handkerchief, Still waving, as the fits and stirs of’s mind Could best express how slow his soul sail’d on, How swift his ship.  IMOGEN. Thou shouldst have made him As little as a crow, or less, ere left To after-eye him.  PISANIO. Madam, so I did.  IMOGEN. I would have broke mine eyestrings, crack’d them but To look upon him, till the diminution Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle; Nay, followed him till he had melted from The smallness of a gnat to air, and then Have turn’d mine eye and wept. But, good Pisanio, When shall we hear from him?  PISANIO. Be assur’d, madam, With his next vantage.  IMOGEN. I did not take my leave of him, but had Most pretty things to say. Ere I could tell him How I would think on him at certain hours Such thoughts and such; or I could make him swear The shes of Italy should not betray Mine interest and his honour; or have charg’d him, At the sixth hour of morn, at noon, at midnight, T’ encounter me with orisons, for then I am in heaven for him; or ere I could Give him that parting kiss which I had set Betwixt two charming words, comes in my father, And like the tyrannous breathing of the north Shakes all our buds from growing.   Enter a Lady.  LADY. The Queen, madam, Desires your Highness’ company.  IMOGEN. Those things I bid you do, get them dispatch’d. I will attend the Queen.  PISANIO. Madam, I shall.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE V. Rome. Philario’s house.   Enter Philario, Iachimo, a Frenchman, a Dutchman and a Spaniard.  IACHIMO. Believe it, sir, I have seen him in Britain. He was then of a crescent note, expected to prove so worthy as since he hath been allowed the name of. But I could then have look’d on him without the help of admiration, though the catalogue of his endowments had been tabled by his side, and I to peruse him by items.  PHILARIO. You speak of him when he was less furnish’d than now he is with that which makes him both without and within.  FRENCHMAN. I have seen him in France; we had very many there could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he.  IACHIMO. This matter of marrying his king’s daughter, wherein he must be weighed rather by her value than his own, words him, I doubt not, a great deal from the matter.  FRENCHMAN. And then his banishment.  IACHIMO. Ay, and the approbation of those that weep this lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully to extend him, be it but to fortify her judgement, which else an easy battery might lay flat, for taking a beggar, without less quality. But how comes it he is to sojourn with you? How creeps acquaintance?  PHILARIO. His father and I were soldiers together, to whom I have been often bound for no less than my life.   Enter Posthumus.  Here comes the Briton. Let him be so entertained amongst you as suits with gentlemen of your knowing to a stranger of his quality. I beseech you all be better known to this gentleman, whom I commend to you as a noble friend of mine. How worthy he is I will leave to appear hereafter, rather than story him in his own hearing.  FRENCHMAN. Sir, we have known together in Orleans.  POSTHUMUS. Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies, which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still.  FRENCHMAN. Sir, you o’errate my poor kindness. I was glad I did atone my countryman and you; it had been pity you should have been put together with so mortal a purpose as then each bore, upon importance of so slight and trivial a nature.  POSTHUMUS. By your pardon, sir. I was then a young traveller; rather shunn’d to go even with what I heard than in my every action to be guided by others’ experiences; but upon my mended judgement (if I offend not to say it is mended) my quarrel was not altogether slight.  FRENCHMAN. Faith, yes, to be put to the arbitrement of swords, and by such two that would by all likelihood have confounded one the other or have fall’n both.  IACHIMO. Can we, with manners, ask what was the difference?  FRENCHMAN. Safely, I think. ’Twas a contention in public, which may, without contradiction, suffer the report. It was much like an argument that fell out last night, where each of us fell in praise of our country mistresses; this gentleman at that time vouching (and upon warrant of bloody affirmation) his to be more fair, virtuous, wise, chaste, constant, qualified, and less attemptable, than any the rarest of our ladies in France.  IACHIMO. That lady is not now living, or this gentleman’s opinion, by this, worn out.  POSTHUMUS. She holds her virtue still, and I my mind.  IACHIMO. You must not so far prefer her ’fore ours of Italy.  POSTHUMUS. Being so far provok’d as I was in France, I would abate her nothing, though I profess myself her adorer, not her friend.  IACHIMO. As fair and as good—a kind of hand-in-hand comparison—had been something too fair and too good for any lady in Britain. If she went before others I have seen as that diamond of yours outlustres many I have beheld, I could not but believe she excelled many; but I have not seen the most precious diamond that is, nor you the lady.  POSTHUMUS. I prais’d her as I rated her. So do I my stone.  IACHIMO. What do you esteem it at?  POSTHUMUS. More than the world enjoys.  IACHIMO. Either your unparagon’d mistress is dead, or she’s outpriz’d by a trifle.  POSTHUMUS. You are mistaken: the one may be sold or given, if there were wealth enough for the purchase or merit for the gift; the other is not a thing for sale, and only the gift of the gods.  IACHIMO. Which the gods have given you?  POSTHUMUS. Which by their graces I will keep.  IACHIMO. You may wear her in title yours; but you know strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds. Your ring may be stol’n too. So your brace of unprizable estimations, the one is but frail and the other casual; a cunning thief, or a that-way-accomplish’d courtier, would hazard the winning both of first and last.  POSTHUMUS. Your Italy contains none so accomplish’d a courtier to convince the honour of my mistress, if in the holding or loss of that you term her frail. I do nothing doubt you have store of thieves; notwithstanding, I fear not my ring.  PHILARIO. Let us leave here, gentlemen.  POSTHUMUS. Sir, with all my heart. This worthy signior, I thank him, makes no stranger of me; we are familiar at first.  IACHIMO. With five times so much conversation I should get ground of your fair mistress; make her go back even to the yielding, had I admittance and opportunity to friend.  POSTHUMUS. No, no.  IACHIMO. I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to your ring, which, in my opinion, o’ervalues it something. But I make my wager rather against your confidence than her reputation; and, to bar your offence herein too, I durst attempt it against any lady in the world.  POSTHUMUS. You are a great deal abus’d in too bold a persuasion, and I doubt not you sustain what y’are worthy of by your attempt.  IACHIMO. What’s that?  POSTHUMUS. A repulse; though your attempt, as you call it, deserve more; a punishment too.  PHILARIO. Gentlemen, enough of this. It came in too suddenly; let it die as it was born, and I pray you be better acquainted.  IACHIMO. Would I had put my estate and my neighbour’s on th’ approbation of what I have spoke!  POSTHUMUS. What lady would you choose to assail?  IACHIMO. Yours, whom in constancy you think stands so safe. I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring that, commend me to the court where your lady is, with no more advantage than the opportunity of a second conference, and I will bring from thence that honour of hers which you imagine so reserv’d.  POSTHUMUS. I will wage against your gold, gold to it. My ring I hold dear as my finger; ’tis part of it.  IACHIMO. You are a friend, and therein the wiser. If you buy ladies’ flesh at a million a dram, you cannot preserve it from tainting. But I see you have some religion in you, that you fear.  POSTHUMUS. This is but a custom in your tongue; you bear a graver purpose, I hope.  IACHIMO. I am the master of my speeches, and would undergo what’s spoken, I swear.  POSTHUMUS. Will you? I shall but lend my diamond till your return. Let there be covenants drawn between’s. My mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your unworthy thinking. I dare you to this match: here’s my ring.  PHILARIO. I will have it no lay.  IACHIMO. By the gods, it is one. If I bring you no sufficient testimony that I have enjoy’d the dearest bodily part of your mistress, my ten thousand ducats are yours; so is your diamond too. If I come off, and leave her in such honour as you have trust in, she your jewel, this your jewel, and my gold are yours: provided I have your commendation for my more free entertainment.  POSTHUMUS. I embrace these conditions; let us have articles betwixt us. Only, thus far you shall answer: if you make your voyage upon her, and give me directly to understand you have prevail’d, I am no further your enemy; she is not worth our debate; if she remain unseduc’d, you not making it appear otherwise, for your ill opinion and th’ assault you have made to her chastity you shall answer me with your sword.  IACHIMO. Your hand, a covenant! We will have these things set down by lawful counsel, and straight away for Britain, lest the bargain should catch cold and starve. I will fetch my gold and have our two wagers recorded.  POSTHUMUS. Agreed.   [_Exeunt Posthumus and Iachimo._]  FRENCHMAN. Will this hold, think you?  PHILARIO. Signior Iachimo will not from it. Pray let us follow ’em.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE VI. Britain. Cymbeline’s palace.   Enter Queen, Ladies and Cornelius.  QUEEN. Whiles yet the dew’s on ground, gather those flowers; Make haste; who has the note of them?  LADY. I, madam.  QUEEN. Dispatch.   [_Exeunt Ladies._]  Now, Master Doctor, have you brought those drugs?  CORNELIUS. Pleaseth your Highness, ay. Here they are, madam.   [_Presenting a box._]  But I beseech your Grace, without offence, (My conscience bids me ask) wherefore you have Commanded of me these most poisonous compounds Which are the movers of a languishing death, But, though slow, deadly?  QUEEN. I wonder, Doctor, Thou ask’st me such a question. Have I not been Thy pupil long? Hast thou not learn’d me how To make perfumes? distil? preserve? yea, so That our great king himself doth woo me oft For my confections? Having thus far proceeded (Unless thou think’st me devilish) is’t not meet That I did amplify my judgement in Other conclusions? I will try the forces Of these thy compounds on such creatures as We count not worth the hanging (but none human) To try the vigour of them, and apply Allayments to their act, and by them gather Their several virtues and effects.  CORNELIUS. Your Highness Shall from this practice but make hard your heart; Besides, the seeing these effects will be Both noisome and infectious.  QUEEN. O, content thee.   Enter Pisanio.  [_Aside._] Here comes a flattering rascal; upon him Will I first work. He’s for his master, An enemy to my son. How now, Pisanio! Doctor, your service for this time is ended; Take your own way.  CORNELIUS. [_Aside._] I do suspect you, madam; But you shall do no harm.  QUEEN. [_To Pisanio._] Hark thee, a word.  CORNELIUS. [_Aside._] I do not like her. She doth think she has Strange ling’ring poisons. I do know her spirit, And will not trust one of her malice with A drug of such damn’d nature. Those she has Will stupefy and dull the sense awhile, Which first perchance she’ll prove on cats and dogs, Then afterward up higher; but there is No danger in what show of death it makes, More than the locking up the spirits a time, To be more fresh, reviving. She is fool’d With a most false effect; and I the truer So to be false with her.  QUEEN. No further service, Doctor, Until I send for thee.  CORNELIUS. I humbly take my leave.   [_Exit._]  QUEEN. Weeps she still, say’st thou? Dost thou think in time She will not quench, and let instructions enter Where folly now possesses? Do thou work. When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son, I’ll tell thee on the instant thou art then As great as is thy master; greater, for His fortunes all lie speechless, and his name Is at last gasp. Return he cannot, nor Continue where he is. To shift his being Is to exchange one misery with another, And every day that comes comes to decay A day’s work in him. What shalt thou expect To be depender on a thing that leans, Who cannot be new built, nor has no friends So much as but to prop him?   [_The Queen drops the box. Pisanio takes it up._]  Thou tak’st up Thou know’st not what; but take it for thy labour. It is a thing I made, which hath the King Five times redeem’d from death. I do not know What is more cordial. Nay, I prithee take it; It is an earnest of a further good That I mean to thee. Tell thy mistress how The case stands with her; do’t as from thyself. Think what a chance thou changest on; but think Thou hast thy mistress still; to boot, my son, Who shall take notice of thee. I’ll move the King To any shape of thy preferment, such As thou’lt desire; and then myself, I chiefly, That set thee on to this desert, am bound To load thy merit richly. Call my women. Think on my words.   [_Exit Pisanio._]  A sly and constant knave, Not to be shak’d; the agent for his master, And the remembrancer of her to hold The hand-fast to her lord. I have given him that Which, if he take, shall quite unpeople her Of liegers for her sweet; and which she after, Except she bend her humour, shall be assur’d To taste of too.   Enter Pisanio and Ladies.  So, so. Well done, well done. The violets, cowslips, and the primroses, Bear to my closet. Fare thee well, Pisanio; Think on my words.   [_Exeunt Queen and Ladies._]  PISANIO. And shall do. But when to my good lord I prove untrue I’ll choke myself: there’s all I’ll do for you.   [_Exit._]  SCENE VII. Britain. The palace.   Enter Imogen alone.  IMOGEN. A father cruel and a step-dame false; A foolish suitor to a wedded lady That hath her husband banish’d. O, that husband! My supreme crown of grief! and those repeated Vexations of it! Had I been thief-stol’n, As my two brothers, happy! but most miserable Is the desire that’s glorious. Blessed be those, How mean soe’er, that have their honest wills, Which seasons comfort. Who may this be? Fie!   Enter Pisanio and Iachimo.  PISANIO. Madam, a noble gentleman of Rome Comes from my lord with letters.  IACHIMO. Change you, madam? The worthy Leonatus is in safety, And greets your Highness dearly.   [_Presents a letter._]  IMOGEN. Thanks, good sir. You’re kindly welcome.  IACHIMO. [_Aside._] All of her that is out of door most rich! If she be furnish’d with a mind so rare, She is alone th’ Arabian bird, and I Have lost the wager. Boldness be my friend! Arm me, audacity, from head to foot! Or, like the Parthian, I shall flying fight; Rather, directly fly.  IMOGEN. [_Reads._] _He is one of the noblest note, to whose kindnesses I am most infinitely tied. Reflect upon him accordingly, as you value your trust.                     LEONATUS._  So far I read aloud; But even the very middle of my heart Is warm’d by th’ rest and takes it thankfully. You are as welcome, worthy sir, as I Have words to bid you; and shall find it so In all that I can do.  IACHIMO. Thanks, fairest lady. What, are men mad? Hath nature given them eyes To see this vaulted arch and the rich crop Of sea and land, which can distinguish ’twixt The fiery orbs above and the twinn’d stones Upon the number’d beach, and can we not Partition make with spectacles so precious ’Twixt fair and foul?  IMOGEN. What makes your admiration?  IACHIMO. It cannot be i’ th’ eye, for apes and monkeys, ’Twixt two such shes, would chatter this way and Contemn with mows the other; nor i’ th’ judgement, For idiots in this case of favour would Be wisely definite; nor i’ th’ appetite; Sluttery, to such neat excellence oppos’d, Should make desire vomit emptiness, Not so allur’d to feed.  IMOGEN. What is the matter, trow?  IACHIMO. The cloyed will— That satiate yet unsatisfied desire, that tub Both fill’d and running—ravening first the lamb, Longs after for the garbage.  IMOGEN. What, dear sir, Thus raps you? Are you well?  IACHIMO. Thanks, madam; well. Beseech you, sir, Desire my man’s abode where I did leave him. He’s strange and peevish.  PISANIO. I was going, sir, To give him welcome.   [_Exit._]  IMOGEN. Continues well my lord? His health beseech you?  IACHIMO. Well, madam.  IMOGEN. Is he dispos’d to mirth? I hope he is.  IACHIMO. Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger there So merry and so gamesome. He is call’d The Briton reveller.  IMOGEN. When he was here He did incline to sadness, and oft-times Not knowing why.  IACHIMO. I never saw him sad. There is a Frenchman his companion, one An eminent monsieur that, it seems, much loves A Gallian girl at home. He furnaces The thick sighs from him; whiles the jolly Briton (Your lord, I mean) laughs from’s free lungs, cries “O, Can my sides hold, to think that man, who knows By history, report, or his own proof, What woman is, yea, what she cannot choose But must be, will’s free hours languish for Assured bondage?”  IMOGEN. Will my lord say so?  IACHIMO. Ay, madam, with his eyes in flood with laughter. It is a recreation to be by And hear him mock the Frenchman. But heavens know Some men are much to blame.  IMOGEN. Not he, I hope.  IACHIMO. Not he; but yet heaven’s bounty towards him might Be us’d more thankfully. In himself, ’tis much; In you, which I account his, beyond all talents. Whilst I am bound to wonder, I am bound To pity too.  IMOGEN. What do you pity, sir?  IACHIMO. Two creatures heartily.  IMOGEN. Am I one, sir? You look on me: what wreck discern you in me Deserves your pity?  IACHIMO. Lamentable! What, To hide me from the radiant sun and solace I’ th’ dungeon by a snuff?  IMOGEN. I pray you, sir, Deliver with more openness your answers To my demands. Why do you pity me?  IACHIMO. That others do, I was about to say, enjoy your—But It is an office of the gods to venge it, Not mine to speak on’t.  IMOGEN. You do seem to know Something of me, or what concerns me; pray you, Since doubting things go ill often hurts more Than to be sure they do; for certainties Either are past remedies, or, timely knowing, The remedy then born—discover to me What both you spur and stop.  IACHIMO. Had I this cheek To bathe my lips upon; this hand, whose touch, Whose every touch, would force the feeler’s soul To th’ oath of loyalty; this object, which Takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye, Fixing it only here; should I, damn’d then, Slaver with lips as common as the stairs That mount the Capitol; join gripes with hands Made hard with hourly falsehood (falsehood as With labour): then by-peeping in an eye Base and illustrious as the smoky light That’s fed with stinking tallow: it were fit That all the plagues of hell should at one time Encounter such revolt.  IMOGEN. My lord, I fear, Has forgot Britain.  IACHIMO. And himself. Not I Inclin’d to this intelligence pronounce The beggary of his change; but ’tis your graces That from my mutest conscience to my tongue Charms this report out.  IMOGEN. Let me hear no more.  IACHIMO. O dearest soul, your cause doth strike my heart With pity that doth make me sick! A lady So fair, and fasten’d to an empery, Would make the great’st king double, to be partner’d With tomboys hir’d with that self exhibition Which your own coffers yield! with diseas’d ventures That play with all infirmities for gold Which rottenness can lend nature! Such boil’d stuff As well might poison poison! Be reveng’d; Or she that bore you was no queen, and you Recoil from your great stock.  IMOGEN. Reveng’d? How should I be reveng’d? If this be true, (As I have such a heart that both mine ears Must not in haste abuse) if it be true, How should I be reveng’d?  IACHIMO. Should he make me Live like Diana’s priest betwixt cold sheets, Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps, In your despite, upon your purse? Revenge it. I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure, More noble than that runagate to your bed, And will continue fast to your affection, Still close as sure.  IMOGEN. What ho, Pisanio!  IACHIMO. Let me my service tender on your lips.  IMOGEN. Away! I do condemn mine ears that have So long attended thee. If thou wert honourable, Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not For such an end thou seek’st, as base as strange. Thou wrong’st a gentleman who is as far From thy report as thou from honour; and Solicits here a lady that disdains Thee and the devil alike. What ho, Pisanio! The King my father shall be made acquainted Of thy assault. If he shall think it fit A saucy stranger in his court to mart As in a Romish stew, and to expound His beastly mind to us, he hath a court He little cares for, and a daughter who He not respects at all. What ho, Pisanio!  IACHIMO. O happy Leonatus! I may say The credit that thy lady hath of thee Deserves thy trust, and thy most perfect goodness Her assur’d credit. Blessed live you long, A lady to the worthiest sir that ever Country call’d his! and you his mistress, only For the most worthiest fit! Give me your pardon. I have spoke this to know if your affiance Were deeply rooted, and shall make your lord That which he is new o’er; and he is one The truest manner’d, such a holy witch That he enchants societies into him, Half all men’s hearts are his.  IMOGEN. You make amends.  IACHIMO. He sits ’mongst men like a descended god: He hath a kind of honour sets him off More than a mortal seeming. Be not angry, Most mighty Princess, that I have adventur’d To try your taking of a false report, which hath Honour’d with confirmation your great judgement In the election of a sir so rare, Which you know cannot err. The love I bear him Made me to fan you thus; but the gods made you, Unlike all others, chaffless. Pray your pardon.  IMOGEN. All’s well, sir; take my pow’r i’ th’ court for yours.  IACHIMO. My humble thanks. I had almost forgot T’ entreat your Grace but in a small request, And yet of moment too, for it concerns Your lord; myself and other noble friends Are partners in the business.  IMOGEN. Pray what is’t?  IACHIMO. Some dozen Romans of us, and your lord (The best feather of our wing) have mingled sums To buy a present for the Emperor; Which I, the factor for the rest, have done In France. ’Tis plate of rare device, and jewels Of rich and exquisite form, their values great; And I am something curious, being strange, To have them in safe stowage. May it please you To take them in protection?  IMOGEN. Willingly; And pawn mine honour for their safety. Since My lord hath interest in them, I will keep them In my bedchamber.  IACHIMO. They are in a trunk, Attended by my men. I will make bold To send them to you only for this night; I must aboard tomorrow.  IMOGEN. O, no, no.  IACHIMO. Yes, I beseech; or I shall short my word By length’ning my return. From Gallia I cross’d the seas on purpose and on promise To see your Grace.  IMOGEN. I thank you for your pains. But not away tomorrow!  IACHIMO. O, I must, madam. Therefore I shall beseech you, if you please To greet your lord with writing, do’t tonight. I have outstood my time, which is material To th’ tender of our present.  IMOGEN. I will write. Send your trunk to me; it shall safe be kept And truly yielded you. You’re very welcome.   [_Exeunt._]
  ACT II  SCENE I. Britain. Before Cymbeline’s palace.
    Hark, hark! the lark at heaven’s gate sings,         And Phœbus ’gins arise,     His steeds to water at those springs         On chalic’d flow’rs that lies;     And winking Mary-buds begin         To ope their golden eyes.     With everything that pretty is,         My lady sweet, arise;             Arise, arise!  CLOTEN. So, get you gone. If this penetrate, I will consider your music the better; if it do not, it is a vice in her ears which horsehairs and calves’ guts, nor the voice of unpaved eunuch to boot, can never amend.   [_Exeunt Musicians._]   Enter Cymbeline and Queen.  SECOND LORD. Here comes the King.  CLOTEN. I am glad I was up so late, for that’s the reason I was up so early. He cannot choose but take this service I have done fatherly.—Good morrow to your Majesty and to my gracious mother.  CYMBELINE. Attend you here the door of our stern daughter? Will she not forth?  CLOTEN. I have assail’d her with musics, but she vouchsafes no notice.  CYMBELINE. The exile of her minion is too new; She hath not yet forgot him; some more time Must wear the print of his remembrance on’t, And then she’s yours.  QUEEN. You are most bound to th’ King, Who lets go by no vantages that may Prefer you to his daughter. Frame yourself To orderly solicits, and be friended With aptness of the season; make denials Increase your services; so seem as if You were inspir’d to do those duties which You tender to her; that you in all obey her, Save when command to your dismission tends, And therein you are senseless.  CLOTEN. Senseless? Not so.   Enter a Messenger.  MESSENGER. So like you, sir, ambassadors from Rome; The one is Caius Lucius.  CYMBELINE. A worthy fellow, Albeit he comes on angry purpose now; But that’s no fault of his. We must receive him According to the honour of his sender; And towards himself, his goodness forespent on us, We must extend our notice. Our dear son, When you have given good morning to your mistress, Attend the Queen and us; we shall have need T’ employ you towards this Roman. Come, our queen.   [_Exeunt all but Cloten._]  CLOTEN. If she be up, I’ll speak with her; if not, Let her lie still and dream. By your leave, ho!   [_Knocks._]  I know her women are about her; what If I do line one of their hands? ’Tis gold Which buys admittance (oft it doth) yea, and makes Diana’s rangers false themselves, yield up Their deer to th’ stand o’ th’ stealer; and ’tis gold Which makes the true man kill’d and saves the thief; Nay, sometime hangs both thief and true man. What Can it not do and undo? I will make One of her women lawyer to me, for I yet not understand the case myself. By your leave.   [_Knocks._]   Enter a Lady.  LADY. Who’s there that knocks?  CLOTEN. A gentleman.  LADY. No more?  CLOTEN. Yes, and a gentlewoman’s son.  LADY. That’s more Than some whose tailors are as dear as yours Can justly boast of. What’s your lordship’s pleasure?  CLOTEN. Your lady’s person; is she ready?  LADY. Ay, To keep her chamber.  CLOTEN. There is gold for you; sell me your good report.  LADY. How? My good name? or to report of you What I shall think is good? The Princess!   Enter Imogen.  CLOTEN. Good morrow, fairest sister. Your sweet hand.   [_Exit Lady._]  IMOGEN. Good morrow, sir. You lay out too much pains For purchasing but trouble. The thanks I give Is telling you that I am poor of thanks, And scarce can spare them.  CLOTEN. Still I swear I love you.  IMOGEN. If you but said so, ’twere as deep with me. If you swear still, your recompense is still That I regard it not.  CLOTEN. This is no answer.  IMOGEN. But that you shall not say I yield, being silent, I would not speak. I pray you spare me. Faith, I shall unfold equal discourtesy To your best kindness; one of your great knowing Should learn, being taught, forbearance.  CLOTEN. To leave you in your madness ’twere my sin; I will not.  IMOGEN. Fools are not mad folks.  CLOTEN. Do you call me fool?  IMOGEN. As I am mad, I do; If you’ll be patient, I’ll no more be mad; That cures us both. I am much sorry, sir, You put me to forget a lady’s manners By being so verbal; and learn now, for all, That I, which know my heart, do here pronounce, By th’ very truth of it, I care not for you, And am so near the lack of charity To accuse myself I hate you; which I had rather You felt than make’t my boast.  CLOTEN. You sin against Obedience, which you owe your father. For The contract you pretend with that base wretch, One bred of alms and foster’d with cold dishes, With scraps o’ th’ court, it is no contract, none. And though it be allowed in meaner parties (Yet who than he more mean?) to knit their souls (On whom there is no more dependency But brats and beggary) in self-figur’d knot, Yet you are curb’d from that enlargement by The consequence o’ th’ crown, and must not foil The precious note of it with a base slave, A hilding for a livery, a squire’s cloth, A pantler; not so eminent!  IMOGEN. Profane fellow! Wert thou the son of Jupiter, and no more But what thou art besides, thou wert too base To be his groom. Thou wert dignified enough, Even to the point of envy, if ’twere made Comparative for your virtues to be styl’d The under-hangman of his kingdom, and hated For being preferr’d so well.  CLOTEN. The south fog rot him!  IMOGEN. He never can meet more mischance than come To be but nam’d of thee. His mean’st garment That ever hath but clipp’d his body, is dearer In my respect, than all the hairs above thee, Were they all made such men. How now, Pisanio!   Enter Pisanio.  CLOTEN. ‘His garment’! Now the devil—  IMOGEN. To Dorothy my woman hie thee presently.  CLOTEN. ‘His garment’!  IMOGEN. I am sprited with a fool; Frighted, and ang’red worse. Go bid my woman Search for a jewel that too casually Hath left mine arm. It was thy master’s; shrew me, If I would lose it for a revenue Of any king’s in Europe! I do think I saw’t this morning; confident I am Last night ’twas on mine arm; I kiss’d it. I hope it be not gone to tell my lord That I kiss aught but he.  PISANIO. ’Twill not be lost.  IMOGEN. I hope so. Go and search.   [_Exit Pisanio._]  CLOTEN. You have abus’d me. ‘His meanest garment’!  IMOGEN. Ay, I said so, sir. If you will make ’t an action, call witness to ’t.  CLOTEN. I will inform your father.  IMOGEN. Your mother too. She’s my good lady and will conceive, I hope, But the worst of me. So I leave you, sir, To th’ worst of discontent.   [_Exit._]  CLOTEN. I’ll be reveng’d. ‘His mean’st garment’! Well.   [_Exit._]  SCENE IV. Rome. Philario’s house.   Enter Posthumus and Philario.  POSTHUMUS. Fear it not, sir; I would I were so sure To win the King as I am bold her honour Will remain hers.  PHILARIO. What means do you make to him?  POSTHUMUS. Not any; but abide the change of time, Quake in the present winter’s state, and wish That warmer days would come. In these fear’d hopes I barely gratify your love; they failing, I must die much your debtor.  PHILARIO. Your very goodness and your company O’erpays all I can do. By this your king Hath heard of great Augustus. Caius Lucius Will do’s commission throughly; and I think He’ll grant the tribute, send th’ arrearages, Or look upon our Romans, whose remembrance Is yet fresh in their grief.  POSTHUMUS. I do believe Statist though I am none, nor like to be, That this will prove a war; and you shall hear The legions now in Gallia sooner landed In our not-fearing Britain than have tidings Of any penny tribute paid. Our countrymen Are men more order’d than when Julius Cæsar Smil’d at their lack of skill, but found their courage Worthy his frowning at. Their discipline, Now mingled with their courages, will make known To their approvers they are people such That mend upon the world.   Enter Iachimo.  PHILARIO. See! Iachimo!  POSTHUMUS. The swiftest harts have posted you by land, And winds of all the corners kiss’d your sails, To make your vessel nimble.  PHILARIO. Welcome, sir.  POSTHUMUS. I hope the briefness of your answer made The speediness of your return.  IACHIMO. Your lady Is one of the fairest that I have look’d upon.  POSTHUMUS. And therewithal the best; or let her beauty Look through a casement to allure false hearts, And be false with them.  IACHIMO. Here are letters for you.  POSTHUMUS. Their tenour good, I trust.  IACHIMO. ’Tis very like.  PHILARIO. Was Caius Lucius in the Britain court When you were there?  IACHIMO. He was expected then, But not approach’d.  POSTHUMUS. All is well yet. Sparkles this stone as it was wont, or is’t not Too dull for your good wearing?  IACHIMO. If I have lost it, I should have lost the worth of it in gold. I’ll make a journey twice as far t’ enjoy A second night of such sweet shortness which Was mine in Britain; for the ring is won.  POSTHUMUS. The stone’s too hard to come by.  IACHIMO. Not a whit, Your lady being so easy.  POSTHUMUS. Make not, sir, Your loss your sport. I hope you know that we Must not continue friends.  IACHIMO. Good sir, we must, If you keep covenant. Had I not brought The knowledge of your mistress home, I grant We were to question farther; but I now Profess myself the winner of her honour, Together with your ring; and not the wronger Of her or you, having proceeded but By both your wills.  POSTHUMUS. If you can make’t apparent That you have tasted her in bed, my hand And ring is yours. If not, the foul opinion You had of her pure honour gains or loses Your sword or mine, or masterless leaves both To who shall find them.  IACHIMO. Sir, my circumstances, Being so near the truth as I will make them, Must first induce you to believe; whose strength I will confirm with oath; which I doubt not You’ll give me leave to spare when you shall find You need it not.  POSTHUMUS. Proceed.  IACHIMO. First, her bedchamber, (Where I confess I slept not, but profess Had that was well worth watching) it was hang’d With tapestry of silk and silver; the story, Proud Cleopatra when she met her Roman And Cydnus swell’d above the banks, or for The press of boats or pride. A piece of work So bravely done, so rich, that it did strive In workmanship and value; which I wonder’d Could be so rarely and exactly wrought, Since the true life on’t was—  POSTHUMUS. This is true; And this you might have heard of here, by me Or by some other.  IACHIMO. More particulars Must justify my knowledge.  POSTHUMUS. So they must, Or do your honour injury.  IACHIMO. The chimney Is south the chamber, and the chimneypiece Chaste Dian bathing. Never saw I figures So likely to report themselves. The cutter Was as another nature, dumb; outwent her, Motion and breath left out.  POSTHUMUS. This is a thing Which you might from relation likewise reap, Being, as it is, much spoke of.  IACHIMO. The roof o’ th’ chamber With golden cherubins is fretted; her andirons (I had forgot them) were two winking Cupids Of silver, each on one foot standing, nicely Depending on their brands.  POSTHUMUS. This is her honour! Let it be granted you have seen all this, and praise Be given to your remembrance; the description Of what is in her chamber nothing saves The wager you have laid.  IACHIMO. Then, if you can, [_Shows the bracelet_] Be pale. I beg but leave to air this jewel. See! And now ’tis up again. It must be married To that your diamond; I’ll keep them.  POSTHUMUS. Jove! Once more let me behold it. Is it that Which I left with her?  IACHIMO. Sir (I thank her) that. She stripp’d it from her arm; I see her yet; Her pretty action did outsell her gift, And yet enrich’d it too. She gave it me, and said She priz’d it once.  POSTHUMUS. May be she pluck’d it off To send it me.  IACHIMO. She writes so to you, doth she?  POSTHUMUS. O, no, no, no! ’tis true. Here, take this too;   [_Gives the ring._]  It is a basilisk unto mine eye, Kills me to look on’t. Let there be no honour Where there is beauty; truth where semblance; love Where there’s another man. The vows of women Of no more bondage be to where they are made Than they are to their virtues, which is nothing. O, above measure false!  PHILARIO. Have patience, sir, And take your ring again; ’tis not yet won. It may be probable she lost it, or Who knows if one her women, being corrupted Hath stol’n it from her?  POSTHUMUS. Very true; And so I hope he came by’t. Back my ring. Render to me some corporal sign about her, More evident than this; for this was stol’n.  IACHIMO. By Jupiter, I had it from her arm!  POSTHUMUS. Hark you, he swears; by Jupiter he swears. ’Tis true, nay, keep the ring, ’tis true. I am sure She would not lose it. Her attendants are All sworn and honourable:—they induc’d to steal it! And by a stranger! No, he hath enjoy’d her. The cognizance of her incontinency Is this: she hath bought the name of whore thus dearly. There, take thy hire; and all the fiends of hell Divide themselves between you!
  ACT III  SCENE I. Britain. A hall in Cymbeline’s palace.
 Enter in state Cymbeline, Queen, Cloten and Lords at one door, and at  another Caius Lucius and Attendants.  CYMBELINE. Now say, what would Augustus Cæsar with us?  LUCIUS. When Julius Cæsar, (whose remembrance yet Lives in men’s eyes, and will to ears and tongues Be theme and hearing ever) was in this Britain, And conquer’d it, Cassibelan, thine uncle, Famous in Cæsar’s praises no whit less Than in his feats deserving it, for him And his succession granted Rome a tribute, Yearly three thousand pounds, which by thee lately Is left untender’d.  QUEEN. And, to kill the marvel, Shall be so ever.  CLOTEN. There be many Cæsars ere such another Julius. Britain is a world by itself, and we will nothing pay for wearing our own noses.  QUEEN. That opportunity, Which then they had to take from’s, to resume We have again. Remember, sir, my liege, The kings your ancestors, together with The natural bravery of your isle, which stands As Neptune’s park, ribb’d and pal’d in With rocks unscaleable and roaring waters, With sands that will not bear your enemies’ boats But suck them up to th’ top-mast. A kind of conquest Cæsar made here, but made not here his brag Of ‘Came, and saw, and overcame.’ With shame (The first that ever touch’d him) he was carried From off our coast, twice beaten; and his shipping (Poor ignorant baubles!) on our terrible seas, Like egg-shells mov’d upon their surges, crack’d As easily ’gainst our rocks; for joy whereof The fam’d Cassibelan, who was once at point (O, giglot fortune!) to master Cæsar’s sword, Made Lud’s Town with rejoicing fires bright And Britons strut with courage.  CLOTEN. Come, there’s no more tribute to be paid. Our kingdom is stronger than it was at that time; and, as I said, there is no moe such Cæsars. Other of them may have crook’d noses; but to owe such straight arms, none.  CYMBELINE. Son, let your mother end.  CLOTEN. We have yet many among us can gripe as hard as Cassibelan. I do not say I am one; but I have a hand. Why tribute? Why should we pay tribute? If Cæsar can hide the sun from us with a blanket, or put the moon in his pocket, we will pay him tribute for light; else, sir, no more tribute, pray you now.  CYMBELINE. You must know, Till the injurious Romans did extort This tribute from us, we were free. Cæsar’s ambition, Which swell’d so much that it did almost stretch The sides o’ th’ world, against all colour here Did put the yoke upon’s; which to shake off Becomes a warlike people, whom we reckon Ourselves to be.  CLOTEN. We do.  CYMBELINE. Say then to Cæsar, Our ancestor was that Mulmutius which Ordain’d our laws, whose use the sword of Cæsar Hath too much mangled; whose repair and franchise Shall, by the power we hold, be our good deed, Though Rome be therefore angry. Mulmutius made our laws, Who was the first of Britain which did put His brows within a golden crown, and call’d Himself a king.  LUCIUS. I am sorry, Cymbeline, That I am to pronounce Augustus Cæsar (Cæsar, that hath moe kings his servants than Thyself domestic officers) thine enemy. Receive it from me, then: war and confusion In Cæsar’s name pronounce I ’gainst thee; look For fury not to be resisted. Thus defied, I thank thee for myself.  CYMBELINE. Thou art welcome, Caius. Thy Cæsar knighted me; my youth I spent Much under him; of him I gather’d honour, Which he to seek of me again, perforce, Behoves me keep at utterance. I am perfect That the Pannonians and Dalmatians for Their liberties are now in arms, a precedent Which not to read would show the Britons cold; So Cæsar shall not find them.  LUCIUS. Let proof speak.  CLOTEN. His majesty bids you welcome. Make pastime with us a day or two, or longer. If you seek us afterwards in other terms, you shall find us in our salt-water girdle. If you beat us out of it, it is yours; if you fall in the adventure, our crows shall fare the better for you; and there’s an end.  LUCIUS. So, sir.  CYMBELINE. I know your master’s pleasure, and he mine; All the remain is, welcome.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. Britain. Another room in Cymbeline’s palace.   Enter Pisanio reading of a letter.  PISANIO. How? of adultery? Wherefore write you not What monsters her accuse? Leonatus! O master, what a strange infection Is fall’n into thy ear! What false Italian (As poisonous-tongu’d as handed) hath prevail’d On thy too ready hearing? Disloyal? No. She’s punish’d for her truth, and undergoes, More goddess-like than wife-like, such assaults As would take in some virtue. O my master, Thy mind to her is now as low as were Thy fortunes. How? that I should murder her? Upon the love, and truth, and vows, which I Have made to thy command? I, her? Her blood? If it be so to do good service, never Let me be counted serviceable. How look I That I should seem to lack humanity So much as this fact comes to?   [_Reads._]  ‘Do’t. The letter That I have sent her, by her own command Shall give thee opportunity.’ O damn’d paper, Black as the ink that’s on thee! Senseless bauble, Art thou a fedary for this act, and look’st So virgin-like without? Lo, here she comes.   Enter Imogen.  I am ignorant in what I am commanded.  IMOGEN. How now, Pisanio?  PISANIO. Madam, here is a letter from my lord.  IMOGEN. Who? thy lord? That is my lord, Leonatus? O, learn’d indeed were that astronomer That knew the stars as I his characters; He’d lay the future open. You good gods, Let what is here contain’d relish of love, Of my lord’s health, of his content; yet not That we two are asunder; let that grieve him! Some griefs are med’cinable; that is one of them, For it doth physic love: of his content, All but in that. Good wax, thy leave. Blest be You bees that make these locks of counsel! Lovers And men in dangerous bonds pray not alike; Though forfeiters you cast in prison, yet You clasp young Cupid’s tables. Good news, gods!   [_Reads._]  _Justice and your father’s wrath, should he take me in his dominion, could not be so cruel to me as you, O the dearest of creatures, would even renew me with your eyes. Take notice that I am in Cambria, at Milford Haven. What your own love will out of this advise you, follow. So he wishes you all happiness that remains loyal to his vow, and your increasing in love.                     LEONATUS POSTHUMUS._  O for a horse with wings! Hear’st thou, Pisanio? He is at Milford Haven. Read, and tell me How far ’tis thither. If one of mean affairs May plod it in a week, why may not I Glide thither in a day? Then, true Pisanio, Who long’st like me to see thy lord, who long’st (O, let me ’bate!) but not like me, yet long’st, But in a fainter kind. O, not like me, For mine’s beyond beyond: say, and speak thick, (Love’s counsellor should fill the bores of hearing To th’ smothering of the sense) how far it is To this same blessed Milford. And by th’ way Tell me how Wales was made so happy as T’ inherit such a haven. But first of all, How we may steal from hence; and for the gap That we shall make in time from our hence-going And our return, to excuse. But first, how get hence. Why should excuse be born or ere begot? We’ll talk of that hereafter. Prithee speak, How many score of miles may we well rid ’Twixt hour and hour?  PISANIO. One score ’twixt sun and sun, Madam, ’s enough for you, and too much too.  IMOGEN. Why, one that rode to’s execution, man, Could never go so slow. I have heard of riding wagers Where horses have been nimbler than the sands That run i’ th’ clock’s behalf. But this is fool’ry. Go bid my woman feign a sickness; say She’ll home to her father; and provide me presently A riding suit, no costlier than would fit A franklin’s huswife.  PISANIO. Madam, you’re best consider.  IMOGEN. I see before me, man. Nor here, nor here, Nor what ensues, but have a fog in them That I cannot look through. Away, I prithee; Do as I bid thee. There’s no more to say. Accessible is none but Milford way.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. Wales. A mountainous country with a cave.   Enter from the cave Belarius, Guiderius and Arviragus.  BELARIUS. A goodly day not to keep house with such Whose roof’s as low as ours! Stoop, boys; this gate Instructs you how t’ adore the heavens, and bows you To a morning’s holy office. The gates of monarchs Are arch’d so high that giants may jet through And keep their impious turbans on without Good morrow to the sun. Hail, thou fair heaven! We house i’ th’ rock, yet use thee not so hardly As prouder livers do.  GUIDERIUS. Hail, heaven!  ARVIRAGUS. Hail, heaven!  BELARIUS. Now for our mountain sport. Up to yond hill, Your legs are young; I’ll tread these flats. Consider, When you above perceive me like a crow, That it is place which lessens and sets off; And you may then revolve what tales I have told you Of courts, of princes, of the tricks in war. This service is not service so being done, But being so allow’d. To apprehend thus Draws us a profit from all things we see, And often to our comfort shall we find The sharded beetle in a safer hold Than is the full-wing’d eagle. O, this life Is nobler than attending for a check, Richer than doing nothing for a robe, Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk: Such gain the cap of him that makes him fine, Yet keeps his book uncross’d. No life to ours!  GUIDERIUS. Out of your proof you speak. We, poor unfledg’d, Have never wing’d from view o’ th’ nest, nor know not What air’s from home. Haply this life is best, If quiet life be best; sweeter to you That have a sharper known; well corresponding With your stiff age. But unto us it is A cell of ignorance, travelling abed, A prison for a debtor that not dares To stride a limit.  ARVIRAGUS. What should we speak of When we are old as you? When we shall hear The rain and wind beat dark December, how, In this our pinching cave, shall we discourse. The freezing hours away? We have seen nothing; We are beastly: subtle as the fox for prey, Like warlike as the wolf for what we eat. Our valour is to chase what flies; our cage We make a choir, as doth the prison’d bird, And sing our bondage freely.  BELARIUS. How you speak! Did you but know the city’s usuries, And felt them knowingly; the art o’ th’ court, As hard to leave as keep, whose top to climb Is certain falling, or so slipp’ry that The fear’s as bad as falling; the toil o’ th’ war, A pain that only seems to seek out danger I’ th’ name of fame and honour, which dies i’ th’ search, And hath as oft a sland’rous epitaph As record of fair act; nay, many times, Doth ill deserve by doing well; what’s worse, Must curtsy at the censure. O, boys, this story The world may read in me; my body’s mark’d With Roman swords, and my report was once First with the best of note. Cymbeline lov’d me; And when a soldier was the theme, my name Was not far off. Then was I as a tree Whose boughs did bend with fruit. But in one night A storm, or robbery, call it what you will, Shook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves, And left me bare to weather.  GUIDERIUS. Uncertain favour!  BELARIUS. My fault being nothing, as I have told you oft, But that two villains, whose false oaths prevail’d Before my perfect honour, swore to Cymbeline I was confederate with the Romans. So Follow’d my banishment, and this twenty years This rock and these demesnes have been my world, Where I have liv’d at honest freedom, paid More pious debts to heaven than in all The fore-end of my time. But up to th’ mountains! This is not hunters’ language. He that strikes The venison first shall be the lord o’ th’ feast; To him the other two shall minister; And we will fear no poison, which attends In place of greater state. I’ll meet you in the valleys.   [_Exeunt Guiderius and Arviragus._]  How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature! These boys know little they are sons to th’ King, Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive. They think they are mine; and though train’d up thus meanly I’ th’ cave wherein they bow, their thoughts do hit The roofs of palaces, and nature prompts them In simple and low things to prince it much Beyond the trick of others. This Polydore, The heir of Cymbeline and Britain, who The King his father call’d Guiderius—Jove! When on my three-foot stool I sit and tell The warlike feats I have done, his spirits fly out Into my story; say ‘Thus mine enemy fell, And thus I set my foot on’s neck’; even then The princely blood flows in his cheek, he sweats, Strains his young nerves, and puts himself in posture That acts my words. The younger brother, Cadwal, Once Arviragus, in as like a figure Strikes life into my speech, and shows much more His own conceiving. Hark, the game is rous’d! O Cymbeline, heaven and my conscience knows Thou didst unjustly banish me! Whereon, At three and two years old, I stole these babes, Thinking to bar thee of succession as Thou refts me of my lands. Euriphile, Thou wast their nurse; they took thee for their mother, And every day do honour to her grave. Myself, Belarius, that am Morgan call’d, They take for natural father. The game is up.   [_Exit._]  SCENE IV. Wales, near Milford Haven.   Enter Pisanio and Imogen.  IMOGEN. Thou told’st me, when we came from horse, the place Was near at hand. Ne’er long’d my mother so To see me first as I have now. Pisanio! Man! Where is Posthumus? What is in thy mind That makes thee stare thus? Wherefore breaks that sigh From th’ inward of thee? One but painted thus Would be interpreted a thing perplex’d Beyond self-explication. Put thyself Into a haviour of less fear, ere wildness Vanquish my staider senses. What’s the matter? Why tender’st thou that paper to me with A look untender? If’t be summer news, Smile to’t before; if winterly, thou need’st But keep that count’nance still. My husband’s hand? That drug-damn’d Italy hath out-craftied him, And he’s at some hard point. Speak, man; thy tongue May take off some extremity, which to read Would be even mortal to me.  PISANIO. Please you read, And you shall find me, wretched man, a thing The most disdain’d of fortune.  IMOGEN. [_Reads._] _Thy mistress, Pisanio, hath play’d the strumpet in my bed, the testimonies whereof lie bleeding in me. I speak not out of weak surmises, but from proof as strong as my grief and as certain as I expect my revenge. That part thou, Pisanio, must act for me, if thy faith be not tainted with the breach of hers. Let thine own hands take away her life; I shall give thee opportunity at Milford Haven; she hath my letter for the purpose; where, if thou fear to strike, and to make me certain it is done, thou art the pandar to her dishonour, and equally to me disloyal._  PISANIO. What shall I need to draw my sword? The paper Hath cut her throat already. No, ’tis slander, Whose edge is sharper than the sword, whose tongue Outvenoms all the worms of Nile, whose breath Rides on the posting winds and doth belie All corners of the world. Kings, queens, and states, Maids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the grave, This viperous slander enters. What cheer, madam?  IMOGEN. False to his bed? What is it to be false? To lie in watch there, and to think on him? To weep twixt clock and clock? If sleep charge nature, To break it with a fearful dream of him, And cry myself awake? That’s false to’s bed, Is it?  PISANIO. Alas, good lady!  IMOGEN. I false! Thy conscience witness! Iachimo, Thou didst accuse him of incontinency; Thou then look’dst like a villain; now, methinks, Thy favour’s good enough. Some jay of Italy, Whose mother was her painting, hath betray’d him. Poor I am stale, a garment out of fashion, And for I am richer than to hang by th’ walls I must be ripp’d. To pieces with me! O, Men’s vows are women’s traitors! All good seeming, By thy revolt, O husband, shall be thought Put on for villainy; not born where’t grows, But worn a bait for ladies.  PISANIO. Good madam, hear me.  IMOGEN. True honest men being heard, like false Æneas, Were, in his time, thought false; and Sinon’s weeping Did scandal many a holy tear, took pity From most true wretchedness. So thou, Posthumus, Wilt lay the leaven on all proper men: Goodly and gallant shall be false and perjur’d From thy great fail. Come, fellow, be thou honest; Do thou thy master’s bidding; when thou seest him, A little witness my obedience. Look! I draw the sword myself; take it, and hit The innocent mansion of my love, my heart. Fear not; ’tis empty of all things but grief; Thy master is not there, who was indeed The riches of it. Do his bidding; strike. Thou mayst be valiant in a better cause, But now thou seem’st a coward.  PISANIO. Hence, vile instrument! Thou shalt not damn my hand.  IMOGEN. Why, I must die; And if I do not by thy hand, thou art No servant of thy master’s. Against self-slaughter There is a prohibition so divine That cravens my weak hand. Come, here’s my heart: Something’s afore’t. Soft, soft! we’ll no defence, Obedient as the scabbard. What is here? The scriptures of the loyal Leonatus All turn’d to heresy? Away, away, Corrupters of my faith, you shall no more Be stomachers to my heart. Thus may poor fools Believe false teachers; though those that are betray’d Do feel the treason sharply, yet the traitor Stands in worse case of woe. And thou, Posthumus, That didst set up my disobedience ’gainst the King My father, and make me put into contempt the suits Of princely fellows, shalt hereafter find It is no act of common passage but A strain of rareness; and I grieve myself To think, when thou shalt be disedg’d by her That now thou tirest on, how thy memory Will then be pang’d by me. Prithee dispatch. The lamb entreats the butcher. Where’s thy knife? Thou art too slow to do thy master’s bidding, When I desire it too.  PISANIO. O gracious lady, Since I receiv’d command to do this busines I have not slept one wink.  IMOGEN. Do’t, and to bed then.  PISANIO. I’ll wake mine eyeballs first.  IMOGEN. Wherefore then Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abus’d So many miles with a pretence? This place? Mine action and thine own? our horses’ labour? The time inviting thee? The perturb’d court, For my being absent? whereunto I never Purpose return. Why hast thou gone so far To be unbent when thou hast ta’en thy stand, Th’ elected deer before thee?  PISANIO. But to win time To lose so bad employment, in the which I have consider’d of a course. Good lady, Hear me with patience.  IMOGEN. Talk thy tongue weary, speak. I have heard I am a strumpet, and mine ear, Therein false struck, can take no greater wound, Nor tent to bottom that. But speak.  PISANIO. Then, madam, I thought you would not back again.  IMOGEN. Most like, Bringing me here to kill me.  PISANIO. Not so, neither; But if I were as wise as honest, then My purpose would prove well. It cannot be But that my master is abus’d. Some villain, Ay, and singular in his art, hath done you both This cursed injury.  IMOGEN. Some Roman courtezan!  PISANIO. No, on my life! I’ll give but notice you are dead, and send him Some bloody sign of it, for ’tis commanded I should do so. You shall be miss’d at court, And that will well confirm it.  IMOGEN. Why, good fellow, What shall I do the while? Where bide? How live? Or in my life what comfort, when I am Dead to my husband?  PISANIO. If you’ll back to th’ court—  IMOGEN. No court, no father, nor no more ado With that harsh, noble, simple nothing, That Cloten, whose love-suit hath been to me As fearful as a siege.  PISANIO. If not at court, Then not in Britain must you bide.  IMOGEN. Where then? Hath Britain all the sun that shines? Day, night, Are they not but in Britain? I’ th’ world’s volume Our Britain seems as of it, but not in’t; In a great pool a swan’s nest. Prithee think There’s livers out of Britain.  PISANIO. I am most glad You think of other place. Th’ ambassador, Lucius the Roman, comes to Milford Haven Tomorrow. Now, if you could wear a mind Dark as your fortune is, and but disguise That which t’ appear itself must not yet be But by self-danger, you should tread a course Pretty and full of view; yea, happily, near The residence of Posthumus; so nigh, at least, That though his actions were not visible, yet Report should render him hourly to your ear As truly as he moves.  IMOGEN. O! for such means, Though peril to my modesty, not death on’t, I would adventure.  PISANIO. Well then, here’s the point: You must forget to be a woman; change Command into obedience; fear and niceness (The handmaids of all women, or, more truly, Woman it pretty self) into a waggish courage; Ready in gibes, quick-answer’d, saucy, and As quarrelous as the weasel. Nay, you must Forget that rarest treasure of your cheek, Exposing it (but, O, the harder heart! Alack, no remedy) to the greedy touch Of common-kissing Titan, and forget Your laboursome and dainty trims wherein You made great Juno angry.  IMOGEN. Nay, be brief; I see into thy end, and am almost A man already.  PISANIO. First, make yourself but like one. Fore-thinking this, I have already fit (’Tis in my cloak-bag) doublet, hat, hose, all That answer to them. Would you, in their serving, And with what imitation you can borrow From youth of such a season, ’fore noble Lucius Present yourself, desire his service, tell him Wherein you’re happy; which will make him know If that his head have ear in music; doubtless With joy he will embrace you; for he’s honourable, And, doubling that, most holy. Your means abroad: You have me, rich; and I will never fail Beginning nor supplyment.  IMOGEN. Thou art all the comfort The gods will diet me with. Prithee away! There’s more to be consider’d; but we’ll even All that good time will give us. This attempt I am soldier to, and will abide it with A prince’s courage. Away, I prithee.  PISANIO. Well, madam, we must take a short farewell, Lest, being miss’d, I be suspected of Your carriage from the court. My noble mistress, Here is a box; I had it from the Queen. What’s in’t is precious. If you are sick at sea Or stomach-qualm’d at land, a dram of this Will drive away distemper. To some shade, And fit you to your manhood. May the gods Direct you to the best!  IMOGEN. Amen. I thank thee.   [_Exeunt severally._]  SCENE V. Britain. Cymbeline’s palace.   Enter Cymbeline, Queen, Cloten, Lucius and Lords.  CYMBELINE. Thus far, and so farewell.  LUCIUS. Thanks, royal sir. My emperor hath wrote; I must from hence, And am right sorry that I must report ye My master’s enemy.  CYMBELINE. Our subjects, sir, Will not endure his yoke; and for ourself To show less sovereignty than they, must needs Appear unkinglike.  LUCIUS. So, sir. I desire of you A conduct overland to Milford Haven. Madam, all joy befall your Grace, and you!  CYMBELINE. My lords, you are appointed for that office; The due of honour in no point omit. So farewell, noble Lucius.  LUCIUS. Your hand, my lord.  CLOTEN. Receive it friendly; but from this time forth I wear it as your enemy.  LUCIUS. Sir, the event Is yet to name the winner. Fare you well.  CYMBELINE. Leave not the worthy Lucius, good my lords, Till he have cross’d the Severn. Happiness!   [_Exeunt Lucius and Lords._]  QUEEN. He goes hence frowning; but it honours us That we have given him cause.  CLOTEN. ’Tis all the better; Your valiant Britons have their wishes in it.  CYMBELINE. Lucius hath wrote already to the Emperor How it goes here. It fits us therefore ripely Our chariots and our horsemen be in readiness. The pow’rs that he already hath in Gallia Will soon be drawn to head, from whence he moves His war for Britain.  QUEEN. ’Tis not sleepy business, But must be look’d to speedily and strongly.  CYMBELINE. Our expectation that it would be thus Hath made us forward. But, my gentle queen, Where is our daughter? She hath not appear’d Before the Roman, nor to us hath tender’d The duty of the day. She looks us like A thing more made of malice than of duty; We have noted it. Call her before us, for We have been too slight in sufferance.   [_Exit an Attendant._]  QUEEN. Royal sir, Since the exile of Posthumus, most retir’d Hath her life been; the cure whereof, my lord, ’Tis time must do. Beseech your Majesty, Forbear sharp speeches to her; she’s a lady So tender of rebukes that words are strokes, And strokes death to her.   Enter Attendant.  CYMBELINE. Where is she, sir? How Can her contempt be answer’d?  ATTENDANT. Please you, sir, Her chambers are all lock’d, and there’s no answer That will be given to th’ loud of noise we make.  QUEEN. My lord, when last I went to visit her, She pray’d me to excuse her keeping close; Whereto constrain’d by her infirmity She should that duty leave unpaid to you Which daily she was bound to proffer. This She wish’d me to make known; but our great court Made me to blame in memory.  CYMBELINE. Her doors lock’d? Not seen of late? Grant, heavens, that which I fear Prove false!   [_Exit._]  QUEEN. Son, I say, follow the King.  CLOTEN. That man of hers, Pisanio, her old servant, I have not seen these two days.  QUEEN. Go, look after.   [_Exit Cloten._]  Pisanio, thou that stand’st so for Posthumus! He hath a drug of mine. I pray his absence Proceed by swallowing that; for he believes It is a thing most precious. But for her, Where is she gone? Haply despair hath seiz’d her; Or, wing’d with fervour of her love, she’s flown To her desir’d Posthumus. Gone she is To death or to dishonour, and my end Can make good use of either. She being down, I have the placing of the British crown.   Enter Cloten.  How now, my son?  CLOTEN. ’Tis certain she is fled. Go in and cheer the King. He rages; none Dare come about him.  QUEEN. All the better. May This night forestall him of the coming day!   [_Exit._]  CLOTEN. I love and hate her; for she’s fair and royal, And that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite Than lady, ladies, woman. From every one The best she hath, and she, of all compounded, Outsells them all. I love her therefore; but Disdaining me and throwing favours on The low Posthumus slanders so her judgement That what’s else rare is chok’d; and in that point I will conclude to hate her, nay, indeed, To be reveng’d upon her. For when fools Shall—   Enter Pisanio.  Who is here? What, are you packing, sirrah? Come hither. Ah, you precious pandar! Villain, Where is thy lady? In a word, or else Thou art straightway with the fiends.  PISANIO. O good my lord!  CLOTEN. Where is thy lady? or, by Jupiter— I will not ask again. Close villain, I’ll have this secret from thy heart, or rip Thy heart to find it. Is she with Posthumus? From whose so many weights of baseness cannot A dram of worth be drawn.  PISANIO. Alas, my lord, How can she be with him? When was she miss’d? He is in Rome.  CLOTEN. Where is she, sir? Come nearer. No farther halting! Satisfy me home What is become of her.  PISANIO. O my all-worthy lord!  CLOTEN. All-worthy villain! Discover where thy mistress is at once, At the next word. No more of ‘worthy lord’! Speak, or thy silence on the instant is Thy condemnation and thy death.  PISANIO. Then, sir, This paper is the history of my knowledge Touching her flight.   [_Presenting a letter._]  CLOTEN. Let’s see’t. I will pursue her Even to Augustus’ throne.  PISANIO. [_Aside._] Or this or perish. She’s far enough; and what he learns by this May prove his travel, not her danger.  CLOTEN. Humh!  PISANIO. [_Aside._] I’ll write to my lord she’s dead. O Imogen, Safe mayst thou wander, safe return again!  CLOTEN. Sirrah, is this letter true?  PISANIO. Sir, as I think.  CLOTEN. It is Posthumus’ hand; I know’t. Sirrah, if thou wouldst not be a villain, but do me true service, undergo those employments wherein I should have cause to use thee with a serious industry—that is, what villainy soe’er I bid thee do, to perform it directly and truly—I would think thee an honest man; thou shouldst neither want my means for thy relief nor my voice for thy preferment.  PISANIO. Well, my good lord.  CLOTEN. Wilt thou serve me? For since patiently and constantly thou hast stuck to the bare fortune of that beggar Posthumus, thou canst not, in the course of gratitude, but be a diligent follower of mine. Wilt thou serve me?  PISANIO. Sir, I will.  CLOTEN. Give me thy hand; here’s my purse. Hast any of thy late master’s garments in thy possession?  PISANIO. I have, my lord, at my lodging, the same suit he wore when he took leave of my lady and mistress.  CLOTEN. The first service thou dost me, fetch that suit hither. Let it be thy first service; go.  PISANIO. I shall, my lord.   [_Exit._]  CLOTEN. Meet thee at Milford Haven! I forgot to ask him one thing; I’ll remember’t anon. Even there, thou villain Posthumus, will I kill thee. I would these garments were come. She said upon a time—the bitterness of it I now belch from my heart—that she held the very garment of Posthumus in more respect than my noble and natural person, together with the adornment of my qualities. With that suit upon my back will I ravish her; first kill him, and in her eyes. There shall she see my valour, which will then be a torment to her contempt. He on the ground, my speech of insultment ended on his dead body, and when my lust hath dined—which, as I say, to vex her I will execute in the clothes that she so prais’d—to the court I’ll knock her back, foot her home again. She hath despis’d me rejoicingly, and I’ll be merry in my revenge.   Enter Pisanio with the clothes.  Be those the garments?  PISANIO. Ay, my noble lord.  CLOTEN. How long is’t since she went to Milford Haven?  PISANIO. She can scarce be there yet.  CLOTEN. Bring this apparel to my chamber; that is the second thing that I have commanded thee. The third is that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to my design. Be but duteous and true, preferment shall tender itself to thee. My revenge is now at Milford, would I had wings to follow it! Come, and be true.   [_Exit._]  PISANIO. Thou bid’st me to my loss; for true to thee Were to prove false, which I will never be, To him that is most true. To Milford go, And find not her whom thou pursuest. Flow, flow, You heavenly blessings, on her! This fool’s speed Be cross’d with slowness! Labour be his meed!   [_Exit._]  SCENE VI. Wales. Before the cave of Belarius.   Enter Imogen alone, in boy’s clothes.  IMOGEN. I see a man’s life is a tedious one. I have tir’d myself, and for two nights together Have made the ground my bed. I should be sick But that my resolution helps me. Milford, When from the mountain-top Pisanio show’d thee, Thou wast within a ken. O Jove! I think Foundations fly the wretched; such, I mean, Where they should be reliev’d. Two beggars told me I could not miss my way. Will poor folks lie, That have afflictions on them, knowing ’tis A punishment or trial? Yes; no wonder, When rich ones scarce tell true. To lapse in fulness Is sorer than to lie for need; and falsehood Is worse in kings than beggars. My dear lord! Thou art one o’ th’ false ones. Now I think on thee My hunger’s gone; but even before, I was At point to sink for food. But what is this? Here is a path to’t; ’tis some savage hold. I were best not call; I dare not call. Yet famine, Ere clean it o’erthrow nature, makes it valiant. Plenty and peace breeds cowards; hardness ever Of hardiness is mother. Ho! who’s here? If anything that’s civil, speak; if savage, Take or lend. Ho! No answer? Then I’ll enter. Best draw my sword; and if mine enemy But fear the sword, like me, he’ll scarcely look on’t. Such a foe, good heavens!   [_Exit into the cave._]  SCENE VII. The same.   Enter Belarius, Guiderius and Arviragus.  BELARIUS. You, Polydore, have prov’d best woodman and Are master of the feast. Cadwal and I Will play the cook and servant; ’tis our match. The sweat of industry would dry and die But for the end it works to. Come, our stomachs Will make what’s homely savoury; weariness Can snore upon the flint, when resty sloth Finds the down pillow hard. Now, peace be here, Poor house, that keep’st thyself!  GUIDERIUS. I am thoroughly weary.  ARVIRAGUS. I am weak with toil, yet strong in appetite.  GUIDERIUS. There is cold meat i’ th’ cave; we’ll browse on that Whilst what we have kill’d be cook’d.  BELARIUS. [_Looking into the cave._] Stay, come not in. But that it eats our victuals, I should think Here were a fairy.  GUIDERIUS. What’s the matter, sir?  BELARIUS. By Jupiter, an angel! or, if not, An earthly paragon! Behold divineness No elder than a boy!   Enter Imogen.  IMOGEN. Good masters, harm me not. Before I enter’d here I call’d, and thought To have begg’d or bought what I have took. Good troth, I have stol’n nought; nor would not though I had found Gold strew’d i’ th’ floor. Here’s money for my meat. I would have left it on the board, so soon As I had made my meal, and parted With pray’rs for the provider.  GUIDERIUS. Money, youth?  ARVIRAGUS. All gold and silver rather turn to dirt, As ’tis no better reckon’d but of those Who worship dirty gods.  IMOGEN. I see you’re angry. Know, if you kill me for my fault, I should Have died had I not made it.  BELARIUS. Whither bound?  IMOGEN. To Milford Haven.  BELARIUS. What’s your name?  IMOGEN. Fidele, sir. I have a kinsman who Is bound for Italy; he embark’d at Milford; To whom being going, almost spent with hunger, I am fall’n in this offence.  BELARIUS. Prithee, fair youth, Think us no churls, nor measure our good minds By this rude place we live in. Well encounter’d! ’Tis almost night; you shall have better cheer Ere you depart, and thanks to stay and eat it. Boys, bid him welcome.  GUIDERIUS. Were you a woman, youth, I should woo hard but be your groom. In honesty I bid for you as I’d buy.  ARVIRAGUS. I’ll make’t my comfort He is a man. I’ll love him as my brother; And such a welcome as I’d give to him After long absence, such is yours. Most welcome! Be sprightly, for you fall ’mongst friends.  IMOGEN. ’Mongst friends, If brothers. [_Aside._] Would it had been so that they Had been my father’s sons! Then had my prize Been less, and so more equal ballasting To thee, Posthumus.  BELARIUS. He wrings at some distress.  GUIDERIUS. Would I could free’t!  ARVIRAGUS. Or I, whate’er it be, What pain it cost, what danger! Gods!  BELARIUS. [_Whispering._] Hark, boys.  IMOGEN. [_Aside._] Great men, That had a court no bigger than this cave, That did attend themselves, and had the virtue Which their own conscience seal’d them, laying by That nothing-gift of differing multitudes, Could not out-peer these twain. Pardon me, gods! I’d change my sex to be companion with them, Since Leonatus false.  BELARIUS. It shall be so. Boys, we’ll go dress our hunt. Fair youth, come in. Discourse is heavy, fasting; when we have supp’d, We’ll mannerly demand thee of thy story, So far as thou wilt speak it.  GUIDERIUS. Pray draw near.  ARVIRAGUS. The night to th’ owl and morn to th’ lark less welcome.  IMOGEN. Thanks, sir.  ARVIRAGUS. I pray draw near.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE VIII. Rome. A public place.   Enter two Roman Senators and Tribunes.  FIRST SENATOR. This is the tenour of the Emperor’s writ: That since the common men are now in action ’Gainst the Pannonians and Dalmatians, And that the legions now in Gallia are Full weak to undertake our wars against The fall’n-off Britons, that we do incite The gentry to this business. He creates Lucius proconsul; and to you, the tribunes, For this immediate levy, he commands His absolute commission. Long live Cæsar!  TRIBUNE. Is Lucius general of the forces?  SECOND SENATOR. Ay.  TRIBUNE. Remaining now in Gallia?  FIRST SENATOR. With those legions Which I have spoke of, whereunto your levy Must be supplyant. The words of your commission Will tie you to the numbers and the time Of their dispatch.  TRIBUNE. We will discharge our duty.   [_Exeunt._]
  ACT IV  SCENE I. Wales. Near the cave of Belarius.
 Enter Cloten alone.  CLOTEN. I am near to th’ place where they should meet, if Pisanio have mapp’d it truly. How fit his garments serve me! Why should his mistress, who was made by him that made the tailor, not be fit too? The rather, saving reverence of the word, for ’tis said a woman’s fitness comes by fits. Therein I must play the workman. I dare speak it to myself, for it is not vain-glory for a man and his glass to confer in his own chamber; I mean, the lines of my body are as well drawn as his; no less young, more strong, not beneath him in fortunes, beyond him in the advantage of the time, above him in birth, alike conversant in general services, and more remarkable in single oppositions. Yet this imperceiverant thing loves him in my despite. What mortality is! Posthumus, thy head, which now is growing upon thy shoulders, shall within this hour be off; thy mistress enforced; thy garments cut to pieces before her face; and all this done, spurn her home to her father, who may, haply, be a little angry for my so rough usage; but my mother, having power of his testiness, shall turn all into my commendations. My horse is tied up safe. Out, sword, and to a sore purpose! Fortune, put them into my hand. This is the very description of their meeting-place; and the fellow dares not deceive me.   [_Exit._]  SCENE II. Wales. Before the cave of Belarius.   Enter from the cave, Belarius, Guiderius, Arviragus and Imogen.  BELARIUS. [_To Imogen._] You are not well. Remain here in the cave; We’ll come to you after hunting.  ARVIRAGUS. [_To Imogen._] Brother, stay here. Are we not brothers?  IMOGEN. So man and man should be; But clay and clay differs in dignity, Whose dust is both alike. I am very sick.  GUIDERIUS. Go you to hunting; I’ll abide with him.  IMOGEN. So sick I am not, yet I am not well; But not so citizen a wanton as To seem to die ere sick. So please you, leave me; Stick to your journal course. The breach of custom Is breach of all. I am ill, but your being by me Cannot amend me; society is no comfort To one not sociable. I am not very sick, Since I can reason of it. Pray you trust me here. I’ll rob none but myself; and let me die, Stealing so poorly.  GUIDERIUS. I love thee; I have spoke it. How much the quantity, the weight as much As I do love my father.  BELARIUS. What? how? how?  ARVIRAGUS. If it be sin to say so, sir, I yoke me In my good brother’s fault. I know not why I love this youth, and I have heard you say Love’s reason’s without reason. The bier at door, And a demand who is’t shall die, I’d say ‘My father, not this youth.’  BELARIUS. [_Aside._] O noble strain! O worthiness of nature! breed of greatness! Cowards father cowards and base things sire base. Nature hath meal and bran, contempt and grace. I’m not their father; yet who this should be Doth miracle itself, lov’d before me.— ’Tis the ninth hour o’ th’ morn.  ARVIRAGUS. Brother, farewell.  IMOGEN. I wish ye sport.  ARVIRAGUS. Your health. [_To Belarius._] So please you, sir.  IMOGEN. [_Aside._] These are kind creatures. Gods, what lies I have heard! Our courtiers say all’s savage but at court. Experience, O, thou disprov’st report! Th’ imperious seas breed monsters; for the dish, Poor tributary rivers as sweet fish. I am sick still; heart-sick. Pisanio, I’ll now taste of thy drug.   [_Swallows some._]  GUIDERIUS. I could not stir him. He said he was gentle, but unfortunate; Dishonestly afflicted, but yet honest.  ARVIRAGUS. Thus did he answer me; yet said hereafter I might know more.  BELARIUS. To th’ field, to th’ field! We’ll leave you for this time. Go in and rest.  ARVIRAGUS. We’ll not be long away.  BELARIUS. Pray be not sick, For you must be our huswife.  IMOGEN. Well, or ill, I am bound to you.  BELARIUS. And shalt be ever.   [_Exit Imogen into the cave._]  This youth, howe’er distress’d, appears he hath had Good ancestors.  ARVIRAGUS. How angel-like he sings!  GUIDERIUS. But his neat cookery! He cut our roots in characters, And sauc’d our broths as Juno had been sick, And he her dieter.  ARVIRAGUS. Nobly he yokes A smiling with a sigh, as if the sigh Was that it was for not being such a smile; The smile mocking the sigh that it would fly From so divine a temple to commix With winds that sailors rail at.  GUIDERIUS. I do note That grief and patience, rooted in him both, Mingle their spurs together.  ARVIRAGUS. Grow patience! And let the stinking elder, grief, untwine His perishing root with the increasing vine!  BELARIUS. It is great morning. Come, away! Who’s there?   Enter Cloten.  CLOTEN. I cannot find those runagates; that villain Hath mock’d me. I am faint.  BELARIUS. Those runagates? Means he not us? I partly know him; ’tis Cloten, the son o’ th’ Queen. I fear some ambush. I saw him not these many years, and yet I know ’tis he. We are held as outlaws. Hence!  GUIDERIUS. He is but one; you and my brother search What companies are near. Pray you away; Let me alone with him.   [_Exeunt Belarius and Arviragus._]  CLOTEN. Soft! What are you That fly me thus? Some villain mountaineers? I have heard of such. What slave art thou?  GUIDERIUS. A thing More slavish did I ne’er than answering A slave without a knock.  CLOTEN. Thou art a robber, A law-breaker, a villain. Yield thee, thief.  GUIDERIUS. To who? To thee? What art thou? Have not I An arm as big as thine, a heart as big? Thy words, I grant, are bigger, for I wear not My dagger in my mouth. Say what thou art; Why I should yield to thee.  CLOTEN. Thou villain base, Know’st me not by my clothes?  GUIDERIUS. No, nor thy tailor, rascal, Who is thy grandfather; he made those clothes, Which, as it seems, make thee.  CLOTEN. Thou precious varlet, My tailor made them not.  GUIDERIUS. Hence, then, and thank The man that gave them thee. Thou art some fool; I am loath to beat thee.  CLOTEN. Thou injurious thief, Hear but my name, and tremble.  GUIDERIUS. What’s thy name?  CLOTEN. Cloten, thou villain.  GUIDERIUS. Cloten, thou double villain, be thy name, I cannot tremble at it. Were it Toad, or Adder, Spider, ’Twould move me sooner.  CLOTEN. To thy further fear, Nay, to thy mere confusion, thou shalt know I am son to th’ Queen.  GUIDERIUS. I’m sorry for’t; not seeming So worthy as thy birth.  CLOTEN. Art not afeard?  GUIDERIUS. Those that I reverence, those I fear—the wise; At fools I laugh, not fear them.  CLOTEN. Die the death. When I have slain thee with my proper hand, I’ll follow those that even now fled hence, And on the gates of Lud’s Town set your heads. Yield, rustic mountaineer.   [_Exeunt, fighting._]   Enter Belarius and Arviragus.  BELARIUS. No company’s abroad?  ARVIRAGUS. None in the world; you did mistake him, sure.  BELARIUS. I cannot tell; long is it since I saw him, But time hath nothing blurr’d those lines of favour Which then he wore; the snatches in his voice, And burst of speaking, were as his. I am absolute ’Twas very Cloten.  ARVIRAGUS. In this place we left them. I wish my brother make good time with him, You say he is so fell.  BELARIUS. Being scarce made up, I mean to man, he had not apprehension Or roaring terrors; for defect of judgement Is oft the cease of fear.   Enter Guiderius with Cloten’s head.  But, see, thy brother.  GUIDERIUS. This Cloten was a fool, an empty purse; There was no money in’t. Not Hercules Could have knock’d out his brains, for he had none; Yet I not doing this, the fool had borne My head as I do his.  BELARIUS. What hast thou done?  GUIDERIUS. I am perfect what: cut off one Cloten’s head, Son to the Queen, after his own report; Who call’d me traitor, mountaineer, and swore With his own single hand he’d take us in, Displace our heads where, thank the gods, they grow, And set them on Lud’s Town.  BELARIUS. We are all undone.  GUIDERIUS. Why, worthy father, what have we to lose But that he swore to take, our lives? The law Protects not us; then why should we be tender To let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us, Play judge and executioner all himself, For we do fear the law? What company Discover you abroad?  BELARIUS. No single soul Can we set eye on, but in all safe reason He must have some attendants. Though his humour Was nothing but mutation, ay, and that From one bad thing to worse, not frenzy, not Absolute madness could so far have rav’d, To bring him here alone. Although perhaps It may be heard at court that such as we Cave here, hunt here, are outlaws, and in time May make some stronger head, the which he hearing, As it is like him, might break out and swear He’d fetch us in; yet is’t not probable To come alone, either he so undertaking Or they so suffering. Then on good ground we fear, If we do fear this body hath a tail More perilous than the head.  ARVIRAGUS. Let ordinance Come as the gods foresay it. Howsoe’er, My brother hath done well.  BELARIUS. I had no mind To hunt this day; the boy Fidele’s sickness Did make my way long forth.  GUIDERIUS. With his own sword, Which he did wave against my throat, I have ta’en His head from him. I’ll throw’t into the creek Behind our rock, and let it to the sea And tell the fishes he’s the Queen’s son, Cloten. That’s all I reck.   [_Exit._]  BELARIUS. I fear ’twill be reveng’d. Would, Polydore, thou hadst not done’t! though valour Becomes thee well enough.  ARVIRAGUS. Would I had done’t, So the revenge alone pursu’d me! Polydore, I love thee brotherly, but envy much Thou hast robb’d me of this deed. I would revenges, That possible strength might meet, would seek us through, And put us to our answer.  BELARIUS. Well, ’tis done. We’ll hunt no more today, nor seek for danger Where there’s no profit. I prithee to our rock. You and Fidele play the cooks; I’ll stay Till hasty Polydore return, and bring him To dinner presently.  ARVIRAGUS. Poor sick Fidele! I’ll willingly to him; to gain his colour I’d let a parish of such Cloten’s blood, And praise myself for charity.   [_Exit._]  BELARIUS. O thou goddess, Thou divine Nature, thou thyself thou blazon’st In these two princely boys! They are as gentle As zephyrs blowing below the violet, Not wagging his sweet head; and yet as rough, Their royal blood enchaf’d, as the rud’st wind That by the top doth take the mountain pine And make him stoop to th’ vale. ’Tis wonder That an invisible instinct should frame them To royalty unlearn’d, honour untaught, Civility not seen from other, valour That wildly grows in them, but yields a crop As if it had been sow’d. Yet still it’s strange What Cloten’s being here to us portends, Or what his death will bring us.   Enter Guiderius.  GUIDERIUS. Where’s my brother? I have sent Cloten’s clotpoll down the stream, In embassy to his mother; his body’s hostage For his return.   [_Solemn music._]  BELARIUS. My ingenious instrument! Hark, Polydore, it sounds. But what occasion Hath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark!  GUIDERIUS. Is he at home?  BELARIUS. He went hence even now.  GUIDERIUS. What does he mean? Since death of my dear’st mother It did not speak before. All solemn things Should answer solemn accidents. The matter? Triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys Is jollity for apes and grief for boys. Is Cadwal mad?   Enter Arviragus with Imogen as dead, bearing her in his arms.  BELARIUS. Look, here he comes, And brings the dire occasion in his arms Of what we blame him for!  ARVIRAGUS. The bird is dead That we have made so much on. I had rather Have skipp’d from sixteen years of age to sixty, To have turn’d my leaping time into a crutch, Than have seen this.  GUIDERIUS. O sweetest, fairest lily! My brother wears thee not the one half so well As when thou grew’st thyself.  BELARIUS. O melancholy! Who ever yet could sound thy bottom? find The ooze to show what coast thy sluggish crare Might’st easiliest harbour in? Thou blessed thing! Jove knows what man thou mightst have made; but I, Thou diedst, a most rare boy, of melancholy. How found you him?  ARVIRAGUS. Stark, as you see; Thus smiling, as some fly had tickled slumber, Not as death’s dart, being laugh’d at; his right cheek Reposing on a cushion.  GUIDERIUS. Where?  ARVIRAGUS. O’ th’ floor; His arms thus leagu’d. I thought he slept, and put My clouted brogues from off my feet, whose rudeness Answer’d my steps too loud.  GUIDERIUS. Why, he but sleeps. If he be gone he’ll make his grave a bed; With female fairies will his tomb be haunted, And worms will not come to thee.  ARVIRAGUS. With fairest flowers, Whilst summer lasts and I live here, Fidele, I’ll sweeten thy sad grave. Thou shalt not lack The flower that’s like thy face, pale primrose; nor The azur’d hare-bell, like thy veins; no, nor The leaf of eglantine, whom not to slander, Out-sweet’ned not thy breath. The ruddock would, With charitable bill (O bill, sore shaming Those rich-left heirs that let their fathers lie Without a monument!) bring thee all this; Yea, and furr’d moss besides, when flow’rs are none, To winter-ground thy corse—  GUIDERIUS. Prithee have done, And do not play in wench-like words with that Which is so serious. Let us bury him, And not protract with admiration what Is now due debt. To th’ grave.  ARVIRAGUS. Say, where shall’s lay him?  GUIDERIUS. By good Euriphile, our mother.  ARVIRAGUS. Be’t so; And let us, Polydore, though now our voices Have got the mannish crack, sing him to th’ ground, As once to our mother; use like note and words, Save that Euriphile must be Fidele.  GUIDERIUS. Cadwal, I cannot sing. I’ll weep, and word it with thee; For notes of sorrow out of tune are worse Than priests and fanes that lie.  ARVIRAGUS. We’ll speak it, then.  BELARIUS. Great griefs, I see, med’cine the less, for Cloten Is quite forgot. He was a queen’s son, boys; And though he came our enemy, remember He was paid for that. Though mean and mighty rotting Together have one dust, yet reverence, That angel of the world, doth make distinction Of place ’tween high and low. Our foe was princely; And though you took his life, as being our foe, Yet bury him as a prince.  GUIDERIUS. Pray you fetch him hither. Thersites’ body is as good as Ajax’, When neither are alive.  ARVIRAGUS. If you’ll go fetch him, We’ll say our song the whilst. Brother, begin.   [_Exit Belarius._]  GUIDERIUS. Nay, Cadwal, we must lay his head to th’ East; My father hath a reason for’t.  ARVIRAGUS. ’Tis true.  GUIDERIUS. Come on, then, and remove him.  ARVIRAGUS. So. Begin.  SONG  GUIDERIUS. _    Fear no more the heat o’ th’ sun,         Nor the furious winter’s rages;     Thou thy worldly task hast done,         Home art gone, and ta’en thy wages.     Golden lads and girls all must,     As chimney-sweepers, come to dust._  ARVIRAGUS. _    Fear no more the frown o’ th’ great;         Thou art past the tyrant’s stroke.     Care no more to clothe and eat;         To thee the reed is as the oak.     The sceptre, learning, physic, must     All follow this and come to dust._  GUIDERIUS. _    Fear no more the lightning flash._  ARVIRAGUS. _        Nor th’ all-dreaded thunder-stone._  GUIDERIUS. _    Fear not slander, censure rash;_  ARVIRAGUS. _    Thou hast finish’d joy and moan._  BOTH. _    All lovers young, all lovers must     Consign to thee and come to dust._  GUIDERIUS. _    No exorciser harm thee!_  ARVIRAGUS. _    Nor no witchcraft charm thee!_  GUIDERIUS. _    Ghost unlaid forbear thee!_  ARVIRAGUS. _    Nothing ill come near thee!_  BOTH. _    Quiet consummation have,     And renowned be thy grave!_   Enter Belarius with the body of Cloten.  GUIDERIUS. We have done our obsequies. Come, lay him down.  BELARIUS. Here’s a few flowers; but ’bout midnight, more. The herbs that have on them cold dew o’ th’ night Are strewings fit’st for graves. Upon their faces. You were as flow’rs, now wither’d. Even so These herblets shall which we upon you strew. Come on, away. Apart upon our knees. The ground that gave them first has them again. Their pleasures here are past, so is their pain.   [_Exeunt all but Imogen._]  IMOGEN. [_Awaking._] Yes, sir, to Milford Haven. Which is the way? I thank you. By yond bush? Pray, how far thither? ’Ods pittikins! can it be six mile yet? I have gone all night. Faith, I’ll lie down and sleep. But, soft! no bedfellow. O gods and goddesses!   [_Seeing the body._]  These flow’rs are like the pleasures of the world; This bloody man, the care on’t. I hope I dream; For so I thought I was a cave-keeper, And cook to honest creatures. But ’tis not so; ’Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot at nothing, Which the brain makes of fumes. Our very eyes Are sometimes, like our judgements, blind. Good faith, I tremble still with fear; but if there be Yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity As a wren’s eye, fear’d gods, a part of it! The dream’s here still. Even when I wake it is Without me, as within me; not imagin’d, felt. A headless man? The garments of Posthumus? I know the shape of’s leg; this is his hand, His foot Mercurial, his Martial thigh, The brawns of Hercules; but his Jovial face— Murder in heaven! How! ’Tis gone. Pisanio, All curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks, And mine to boot, be darted on thee! Thou, Conspir’d with that irregulous devil, Cloten, Hath here cut off my lord. To write and read Be henceforth treacherous! Damn’d Pisanio Hath with his forged letters (damn’d Pisanio) From this most bravest vessel of the world Struck the main-top. O Posthumus! alas, Where is thy head? Where’s that? Ay me! where’s that? Pisanio might have kill’d thee at the heart, And left this head on. How should this be? Pisanio? ’Tis he and Cloten; malice and lucre in them Have laid this woe here. O, ’tis pregnant, pregnant! The drug he gave me, which he said was precious And cordial to me, have I not found it Murd’rous to th’ senses? That confirms it home. This is Pisanio’s deed, and Cloten. O! Give colour to my pale cheek with thy blood, That we the horrider may seem to those Which chance to find us. O, my lord, my lord!   [_Falls fainting on the body._]   Enter Lucius, Captains and a Soothsayer.  CAPTAIN. To them the legions garrison’d in Gallia, After your will, have cross’d the sea, attending You here at Milford Haven; with your ships, They are in readiness.  LUCIUS. But what from Rome?  CAPTAIN. The Senate hath stirr’d up the confiners And gentlemen of Italy, most willing spirits, That promise noble service; and they come Under the conduct of bold Iachimo, Sienna’s brother.  LUCIUS. When expect you them?  CAPTAIN. With the next benefit o’ th’ wind.  LUCIUS. This forwardness Makes our hopes fair. Command our present numbers Be muster’d; bid the captains look to’t. Now, sir, What have you dream’d of late of this war’s purpose?  SOOTHSAYER. Last night the very gods show’d me a vision (I fast and pray’d for their intelligence) thus: I saw Jove’s bird, the Roman eagle, wing’d From the spongy south to this part of the west, There vanish’d in the sunbeams; which portends, Unless my sins abuse my divination, Success to th’ Roman host.  LUCIUS. Dream often so, And never false. Soft, ho! what trunk is here Without his top? The ruin speaks that sometime It was a worthy building. How? a page? Or dead or sleeping on him? But dead, rather; For nature doth abhor to make his bed With the defunct, or sleep upon the dead. Let’s see the boy’s face.  CAPTAIN. He’s alive, my lord.  LUCIUS. He’ll then instruct us of this body. Young one, Inform us of thy fortunes; for it seems They crave to be demanded. Who is this Thou mak’st thy bloody pillow? Or who was he That, otherwise than noble nature did, Hath alter’d that good picture? What’s thy interest In this sad wreck? How came’t? Who is’t? What art thou?  IMOGEN. I am nothing; or if not, Nothing to be were better. This was my master, A very valiant Briton and a good, That here by mountaineers lies slain. Alas! There is no more such masters. I may wander From east to occident; cry out for service; Try many, all good; serve truly; never Find such another master.  LUCIUS. ’Lack, good youth! Thou mov’st no less with thy complaining than Thy master in bleeding. Say his name, good friend.  IMOGEN. Richard du Champ. [_Aside._] If I do lie, and do No harm by it, though the gods hear, I hope They’ll pardon it.—Say you, sir?  LUCIUS. Thy name?  IMOGEN. Fidele, sir.  LUCIUS. Thou dost approve thyself the very same; Thy name well fits thy faith, thy faith thy name. Wilt take thy chance with me? I will not say Thou shalt be so well master’d; but, be sure, No less belov’d. The Roman Emperor’s letters, Sent by a consul to me, should not sooner Than thine own worth prefer thee. Go with me.  IMOGEN. I’ll follow, sir. But first, an’t please the gods, I’ll hide my master from the flies, as deep As these poor pickaxes can dig; and when With wild wood-leaves and weeds I ha’ strew’d his grave, And on it said a century of prayers, Such as I can, twice o’er, I’ll weep and sigh; And leaving so his service, follow you, So please you entertain me.  LUCIUS. Ay, good youth; And rather father thee than master thee. My friends, The boy hath taught us manly duties; let us Find out the prettiest daisied plot we can, And make him with our pikes and partisans A grave. Come, arm him. Boy, he is preferr’d By thee to us; and he shall be interr’d As soldiers can. Be cheerful; wipe thine eyes. Some falls are means the happier to arise.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. Britain. Cymbeline’s palace.   Enter Cymbeline, Lords, Pisanio and Attendants.  CYMBELINE. Again! and bring me word how ’tis with her.   [_Exit an Attendant._]  A fever with the absence of her son; A madness, of which her life’s in danger. Heavens, How deeply you at once do touch me! Imogen, The great part of my comfort, gone; my queen Upon a desperate bed, and in a time When fearful wars point at me; her son gone, So needful for this present. It strikes me past The hope of comfort. But for thee, fellow, Who needs must know of her departure and Dost seem so ignorant, we’ll enforce it from thee By a sharp torture.  PISANIO. Sir, my life is yours; I humbly set it at your will; but for my mistress, I nothing know where she remains, why gone, Nor when she purposes return. Beseech your Highness, Hold me your loyal servant.  LORD. Good my liege, The day that she was missing he was here. I dare be bound he’s true and shall perform All parts of his subjection loyally. For Cloten, There wants no diligence in seeking him, And will no doubt be found.  CYMBELINE. The time is troublesome. [_To Pisanio._] We’ll slip you for a season; but our jealousy Does yet depend.  LORD. So please your Majesty, The Roman legions, all from Gallia drawn, Are landed on your coast, with a supply Of Roman gentlemen by the Senate sent.  CYMBELINE. Now for the counsel of my son and queen! I am amaz’d with matter.  LORD. Good my liege, Your preparation can affront no less Than what you hear of. Come more, for more you’re ready. The want is but to put those pow’rs in motion That long to move.  CYMBELINE. I thank you. Let’s withdraw, And meet the time as it seeks us. We fear not What can from Italy annoy us; but We grieve at chances here. Away!   [_Exeunt all but Pisanio._]  PISANIO. I heard no letter from my master since I wrote him Imogen was slain. ’Tis strange. Nor hear I from my mistress, who did promise To yield me often tidings. Neither know I What is betid to Cloten, but remain Perplex’d in all. The heavens still must work. Wherein I am false I am honest; not true, to be true. These present wars shall find I love my country, Even to the note o’ th’ King, or I’ll fall in them. All other doubts, by time let them be clear’d: Fortune brings in some boats that are not steer’d.   [_Exit._]  SCENE IV. Wales. Before the cave of Belarius.   Enter Belarius, Guiderius and Arviragus.  GUIDERIUS. The noise is round about us.  BELARIUS. Let us from it.  ARVIRAGUS. What pleasure, sir, find we in life, to lock it From action and adventure?  GUIDERIUS. Nay, what hope Have we in hiding us? This way the Romans Must or for Britons slay us, or receive us For barbarous and unnatural revolts During their use, and slay us after.  BELARIUS. Sons, We’ll higher to the mountains; there secure us. To the King’s party there’s no going. Newness Of Cloten’s death (we being not known, not muster’d Among the bands) may drive us to a render Where we have liv’d, and so extort from’s that Which we have done, whose answer would be death, Drawn on with torture.  GUIDERIUS. This is, sir, a doubt In such a time nothing becoming you Nor satisfying us.  ARVIRAGUS. It is not likely That when they hear the Roman horses neigh, Behold their quarter’d fires, have both their eyes And ears so cloy’d importantly as now, That they will waste their time upon our note, To know from whence we are.  BELARIUS. O, I am known Of many in the army. Many years, Though Cloten then but young, you see, not wore him From my remembrance. And, besides, the King Hath not deserv’d my service nor your loves, Who find in my exile the want of breeding, The certainty of this hard life; aye hopeless To have the courtesy your cradle promis’d, But to be still hot summer’s tanlings and The shrinking slaves of winter.  GUIDERIUS. Than be so, Better to cease to be. Pray, sir, to th’ army. I and my brother are not known; yourself So out of thought, and thereto so o’ergrown, Cannot be questioned.  ARVIRAGUS. By this sun that shines, I’ll thither. What thing is’t that I never Did see man die! scarce ever look’d on blood But that of coward hares, hot goats, and venison! Never bestrid a horse, save one that had A rider like myself, who ne’er wore rowel Nor iron on his heel! I am asham’d To look upon the holy sun, to have The benefit of his blest beams, remaining So long a poor unknown.  GUIDERIUS. By heavens, I’ll go! If you will bless me, sir, and give me leave, I’ll take the better care; but if you will not, The hazard therefore due fall on me by The hands of Romans!  ARVIRAGUS. So say I. Amen.  BELARIUS. No reason I, since of your lives you set So slight a valuation, should reserve My crack’d one to more care. Have with you, boys! If in your country wars you chance to die, That is my bed too, lads, and there I’ll lie. Lead, lead. [_Aside._] The time seems long; their blood thinks scorn Till it fly out and show them princes born.   [_Exeunt._]
  ACT V  SCENE I. Britain. The Roman camp.
 Enter Posthumus alone, with a bloody handkerchief.  POSTHUMUS. Yea, bloody cloth, I’ll keep thee; for I wish’d Thou shouldst be colour’d thus. You married ones, If each of you should take this course, how many Must murder wives much better than themselves For wrying but a little! O Pisanio! Every good servant does not all commands; No bond but to do just ones. Gods! if you Should have ta’en vengeance on my faults, I never Had liv’d to put on this; so had you saved The noble Imogen to repent, and struck Me, wretch more worth your vengeance. But alack, You snatch some hence for little faults; that’s love, To have them fall no more. You some permit To second ills with ills, each elder worse, And make them dread it, to the doers’ thrift. But Imogen is your own. Do your best wills, And make me blest to obey. I am brought hither Among th’ Italian gentry, and to fight Against my lady’s kingdom. ’Tis enough That, Britain, I have kill’d thy mistress; peace! I’ll give no wound to thee. Therefore, good heavens, Hear patiently my purpose. I’ll disrobe me Of these Italian weeds, and suit myself As does a Britain peasant. So I’ll fight Against the part I come with; so I’ll die For thee, O Imogen, even for whom my life Is every breath a death. And thus unknown, Pitied nor hated, to the face of peril Myself I’ll dedicate. Let me make men know More valour in me than my habits show. Gods, put the strength o’ th’ Leonati in me! To shame the guise o’ th’ world, I will begin The fashion less without and more within.   [_Exit._]  SCENE II. Britain. A field of battle between the British and Roman camps.   Enter Lucius, Iachimo and the Roman army at one door, and the British  army at another, Leonatus Posthumus following like a poor soldier.  They march over and go out. Alarums. Then enter again, in skirmish,  Iachimo and Posthumus. He vanquisheth and disarmeth Iachimo and then  leaves him.  IACHIMO. The heaviness and guilt within my bosom Takes off my manhood. I have belied a lady, The Princess of this country, and the air on’t Revengingly enfeebles me; or could this carl, A very drudge of nature’s, have subdu’d me In my profession? Knighthoods and honours borne As I wear mine are titles but of scorn. If that thy gentry, Britain, go before This lout as he exceeds our lords, the odds Is that we scarce are men, and you are gods.   [_Exit._]   The battle continues; the Britons fly; Cymbeline is taken. Then enter  to his rescue Belarius, Guiderius and Arviragus.  BELARIUS. Stand, stand! We have th’ advantage of the ground; The lane is guarded; nothing routs us but The villainy of our fears.  GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS. Stand, stand, and fight!   Enter Posthumus and seconds the Britons; they rescue Cymbeline and  exeunt. Then re-enter Lucius and Iachimo with Imogen.  LUCIUS. Away, boy, from the troops, and save thyself; For friends kill friends, and the disorder’s such As war were hoodwink’d.  IACHIMO. ’Tis their fresh supplies.  LUCIUS. It is a day turn’d strangely. Or betimes Let’s reinforce or fly.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. Another part of the field.   Enter Posthumus and a Briton Lord.  LORD. Cam’st thou from where they made the stand?  POSTHUMUS. I did: Though you, it seems, come from the fliers.  LORD. I did.  POSTHUMUS. No blame be to you, sir, for all was lost, But that the heavens fought. The King himself Of his wings destitute, the army broken, And but the backs of Britons seen, all flying, Through a strait lane; the enemy, full-hearted, Lolling the tongue with slaught’ring, having work More plentiful than tools to do’t, struck down Some mortally, some slightly touch’d, some falling Merely through fear, that the strait pass was damm’d With dead men hurt behind, and cowards living To die with length’ned shame.  LORD. Where was this lane?  POSTHUMUS. Close by the battle, ditch’d, and wall’d with turf, Which gave advantage to an ancient soldier, An honest one, I warrant, who deserv’d So long a breeding as his white beard came to, In doing this for’s country. Athwart the lane He, with two striplings (lads more like to run The country base than to commit such slaughter; With faces fit for masks, or rather fairer Than those for preservation cas’d or shame) Made good the passage, cried to those that fled ‘Our Britain’s harts die flying, not our men. To darkness fleet souls that fly backwards! Stand; Or we are Romans and will give you that, Like beasts, which you shun beastly, and may save But to look back in frown. Stand, stand!’ These three, Three thousand confident, in act as many— For three performers are the file when all The rest do nothing—with this word ‘Stand, stand!’ Accommodated by the place, more charming With their own nobleness, which could have turn’d A distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks, Part shame, part spirit renew’d; that some turn’d coward But by example (O, a sin in war Damn’d in the first beginners) ’gan to look The way that they did and to grin like lions Upon the pikes o’ th’ hunters. Then began A stop i’ th’ chaser, a retire; anon A rout, confusion thick. Forthwith they fly, Chickens, the way which they stoop’d eagles; slaves, The strides they victors made; and now our cowards, Like fragments in hard voyages, became The life o’ th’ need. Having found the back-door open Of the unguarded hearts, heavens, how they wound! Some slain before, some dying, some their friends O’erborne i’ th’ former wave. Ten chas’d by one Are now each one the slaughterman of twenty. Those that would die or ere resist are grown The mortal bugs o’ th’ field.  LORD. This was strange chance: A narrow lane, an old man, and two boys.  POSTHUMUS. Nay, do not wonder at it; you are made Rather to wonder at the things you hear Than to work any. Will you rhyme upon’t, And vent it for a mock’ry? Here is one:

Enter Francisco and Barnardo, two sentinels.  BARNARDO. Who’s there?  FRANCISCO. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.  BARNARDO. Long live the King!  FRANCISCO. Barnardo?  BARNARDO. He.  FRANCISCO. You come most carefully upon your hour.  BARNARDO. ’Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.  FRANCISCO. For this relief much thanks. ’Tis bitter cold, And I am sick at heart.  BARNARDO. Have you had quiet guard?  FRANCISCO. Not a mouse stirring.  BARNARDO. Well, good night. If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus, The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.  Enter Horatio and Marcellus.  FRANCISCO. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?  HORATIO. Friends to this ground.  MARCELLUS. And liegemen to the Dane.  FRANCISCO. Give you good night.  MARCELLUS. O, farewell, honest soldier, who hath reliev’d you?  FRANCISCO. Barnardo has my place. Give you good-night.  [_Exit._]  MARCELLUS. Holla, Barnardo!  BARNARDO. Say, what, is Horatio there?  HORATIO. A piece of him.  BARNARDO. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.  MARCELLUS. What, has this thing appear’d again tonight?  BARNARDO. I have seen nothing.  MARCELLUS. Horatio says ’tis but our fantasy, And will not let belief take hold of him Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us. Therefore I have entreated him along With us to watch the minutes of this night, That if again this apparition come He may approve our eyes and speak to it.  HORATIO. Tush, tush, ’twill not appear.  BARNARDO. Sit down awhile, And let us once again assail your ears, That are so fortified against our story, What we two nights have seen.  HORATIO. Well, sit we down, And let us hear Barnardo speak of this.  BARNARDO. Last night of all, When yond same star that’s westward from the pole, Had made his course t’illume that part of heaven Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself, The bell then beating one—  MARCELLUS. Peace, break thee off. Look where it comes again.  Enter Ghost.  BARNARDO. In the same figure, like the King that’s dead.  MARCELLUS. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.  BARNARDO. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.  HORATIO. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.  BARNARDO It would be spoke to.  MARCELLUS. Question it, Horatio.  HORATIO. What art thou that usurp’st this time of night, Together with that fair and warlike form In which the majesty of buried Denmark Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak.  MARCELLUS. It is offended.  BARNARDO. See, it stalks away.  HORATIO. Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee speak!  [_Exit Ghost._]  MARCELLUS. ’Tis gone, and will not answer.  BARNARDO. How now, Horatio! You tremble and look pale. Is not this something more than fantasy? What think you on’t?  HORATIO. Before my God, I might not this believe Without the sensible and true avouch Of mine own eyes.  MARCELLUS. Is it not like the King?  HORATIO. As thou art to thyself: Such was the very armour he had on When he th’ambitious Norway combated; So frown’d he once, when in an angry parle He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. ’Tis strange.  MARCELLUS. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.  HORATIO. In what particular thought to work I know not; But in the gross and scope of my opinion, This bodes some strange eruption to our state.  MARCELLUS. Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows, Why this same strict and most observant watch So nightly toils the subject of the land, And why such daily cast of brazen cannon And foreign mart for implements of war; Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task Does not divide the Sunday from the week. What might be toward, that this sweaty haste Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day: Who is’t that can inform me?  HORATIO. That can I; At least, the whisper goes so. Our last King, Whose image even but now appear’d to us, Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, Thereto prick’d on by a most emulate pride, Dar’d to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet, For so this side of our known world esteem’d him, Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal’d compact, Well ratified by law and heraldry, Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands Which he stood seiz’d of, to the conqueror; Against the which, a moiety competent Was gaged by our King; which had return’d To the inheritance of Fortinbras, Had he been vanquisher; as by the same cov’nant And carriage of the article design’d, His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, Of unimproved mettle, hot and full, Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, Shark’d up a list of lawless resolutes, For food and diet, to some enterprise That hath a stomach in’t; which is no other, As it doth well appear unto our state, But to recover of us by strong hand And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands So by his father lost. And this, I take it, Is the main motive of our preparations, The source of this our watch, and the chief head Of this post-haste and rummage in the land.  BARNARDO. I think it be no other but e’en so: Well may it sort that this portentous figure Comes armed through our watch so like the King That was and is the question of these wars.  HORATIO. A mote it is to trouble the mind’s eye. In the most high and palmy state of Rome, A little ere the mightiest Julius fell, The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood, Disasters in the sun; and the moist star, Upon whose influence Neptune’s empire stands, Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. And even the like precurse of fierce events, As harbingers preceding still the fates And prologue to the omen coming on, Have heaven and earth together demonstrated Unto our climatures and countrymen.  Re-enter Ghost.  But, soft, behold! Lo, where it comes again! I’ll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion! If thou hast any sound, or use of voice, Speak to me. If there be any good thing to be done, That may to thee do ease, and grace to me, Speak to me. If thou art privy to thy country’s fate, Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O speak! Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life Extorted treasure in the womb of earth, For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death, Speak of it. Stay, and speak!  [_The cock crows._]  Stop it, Marcellus!  MARCELLUS. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?  HORATIO. Do, if it will not stand.  BARNARDO. ’Tis here!  HORATIO. ’Tis here!  [_Exit Ghost._]  MARCELLUS. ’Tis gone! We do it wrong, being so majestical, To offer it the show of violence, For it is as the air, invulnerable, And our vain blows malicious mockery.  BARNARDO. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.  HORATIO. And then it started, like a guilty thing Upon a fearful summons. I have heard The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat Awake the god of day; and at his warning, Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air, Th’extravagant and erring spirit hies To his confine. And of the truth herein This present object made probation.  MARCELLUS. It faded on the crowing of the cock. Some say that ever ’gainst that season comes Wherein our Saviour’s birth is celebrated, The bird of dawning singeth all night long; And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike, No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm; So hallow’d and so gracious is the time.  HORATIO. So have I heard, and do in part believe it. But look, the morn in russet mantle clad, Walks o’er the dew of yon high eastward hill. Break we our watch up, and by my advice, Let us impart what we have seen tonight Unto young Hamlet; for upon my life, This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it, As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?  MARCELLUS. Let’s do’t, I pray, and I this morning know Where we shall find him most conveniently.  [_Exeunt._]   SCENE II. Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.  Enter Claudius King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen, Hamlet, Polonius, Laertes, Voltemand, Cornelius, Lords and Attendant.  KING. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother’s death The memory be green, and that it us befitted To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom To be contracted in one brow of woe; Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature That we with wisest sorrow think on him, Together with remembrance of ourselves. Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen, Th’imperial jointress to this warlike state, Have we, as ’twere with a defeated joy, With one auspicious and one dropping eye, With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage, In equal scale weighing delight and dole, Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr’d Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone With this affair along. For all, our thanks. Now follows, that you know young Fortinbras, Holding a weak supposal of our worth, Or thinking by our late dear brother’s death Our state to be disjoint and out of frame, Colleagued with this dream of his advantage, He hath not fail’d to pester us with message, Importing the surrender of those lands Lost by his father, with all bonds of law, To our most valiant brother. So much for him. Now for ourself and for this time of meeting: Thus much the business is: we have here writ To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras, Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears Of this his nephew’s purpose, to suppress His further gait herein; in that the levies, The lists, and full proportions are all made Out of his subject: and we here dispatch You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand, For bearers of this greeting to old Norway, Giving to you no further personal power To business with the King, more than the scope Of these dilated articles allow. Farewell; and let your haste commend your duty.  CORNELIUS and VOLTEMAND. In that, and all things, will we show our duty.  KING. We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.  [_Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius._]  And now, Laertes, what’s the news with you? You told us of some suit. What is’t, Laertes? You cannot speak of reason to the Dane, And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes, That shall not be my offer, not thy asking? The head is not more native to the heart, The hand more instrumental to the mouth, Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father. What wouldst thou have, Laertes?  LAERTES. Dread my lord, Your leave and favour to return to France, From whence though willingly I came to Denmark To show my duty in your coronation; Yet now I must confess, that duty done, My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France, And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.  KING. Have you your father’s leave? What says Polonius?  POLONIUS. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave By laboursome petition; and at last Upon his will I seal’d my hard consent. I do beseech you give him leave to go.  KING. Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine, And thy best graces spend it at thy will! But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son—  HAMLET. [_Aside._] A little more than kin, and less than kind.  KING. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?  HAMLET. Not so, my lord, I am too much i’ the sun.  QUEEN. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off, And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark. Do not for ever with thy vailed lids Seek for thy noble father in the dust. Thou know’st ’tis common, all that lives must die, Passing through nature to eternity.  HAMLET. Ay, madam, it is common.  QUEEN. If it be, Why seems it so particular with thee?  HAMLET. Seems, madam! Nay, it is; I know not seems. ’Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother, Nor customary suits of solemn black, Nor windy suspiration of forc’d breath, No, nor the fruitful river in the eye, Nor the dejected haviour of the visage, Together with all forms, moods, shows of grief, That can denote me truly. These indeed seem, For they are actions that a man might play; But I have that within which passeth show; These but the trappings and the suits of woe.  KING. ’Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet, To give these mourning duties to your father; But you must know, your father lost a father, That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound In filial obligation, for some term To do obsequious sorrow. But to persevere In obstinate condolement is a course Of impious stubbornness. ’Tis unmanly grief, It shows a will most incorrect to heaven, A heart unfortified, a mind impatient, An understanding simple and unschool’d; For what we know must be, and is as common As any the most vulgar thing to sense, Why should we in our peevish opposition Take it to heart? Fie, ’tis a fault to heaven, A fault against the dead, a fault to nature, To reason most absurd, whose common theme Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried, From the first corse till he that died today, ‘This must be so.’ We pray you throw to earth This unprevailing woe, and think of us As of a father; for let the world take note You are the most immediate to our throne, And with no less nobility of love Than that which dearest father bears his son Do I impart toward you. For your intent In going back to school in Wittenberg, It is most retrograde to our desire: And we beseech you bend you to remain Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye, Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.  QUEEN. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet. I pray thee stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.  HAMLET. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.  KING. Why, ’tis a loving and a fair reply. Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come; This gentle and unforc’d accord of Hamlet Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof, No jocund health that Denmark drinks today But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell, And the King’s rouse the heaven shall bruit again, Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.  [_Exeunt all but Hamlet._]  HAMLET. O that this too too solid flesh would melt, Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew! Or that the Everlasting had not fix’d His canon ’gainst self-slaughter. O God! O God! How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable Seem to me all the uses of this world! Fie on’t! Oh fie! ’tis an unweeded garden That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature Possess it merely. That it should come to this! But two months dead—nay, not so much, not two: So excellent a king; that was to this Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother, That he might not beteem the winds of heaven Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth! Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him As if increase of appetite had grown By what it fed on; and yet, within a month— Let me not think on’t—Frailty, thy name is woman! A little month, or ere those shoes were old With which she followed my poor father’s body Like Niobe, all tears.—Why she, even she— O God! A beast that wants discourse of reason Would have mourn’d longer,—married with mine uncle, My father’s brother; but no more like my father Than I to Hercules. Within a month, Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears Had left the flushing in her galled eyes, She married. O most wicked speed, to post With such dexterity to incestuous sheets! It is not, nor it cannot come to good. But break, my heart, for I must hold my tongue.  Enter Horatio, Marcellus and Barnardo.  HORATIO. Hail to your lordship!  HAMLET. I am glad to see you well: Horatio, or I do forget myself.  HORATIO. The same, my lord, And your poor servant ever.  HAMLET. Sir, my good friend; I’ll change that name with you: And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?— Marcellus?  MARCELLUS. My good lord.  HAMLET. I am very glad to see you.—Good even, sir.— But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?  HORATIO. A truant disposition, good my lord.  HAMLET. I would not hear your enemy say so; Nor shall you do my ear that violence, To make it truster of your own report Against yourself. I know you are no truant. But what is your affair in Elsinore? We’ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.  HORATIO. My lord, I came to see your father’s funeral.  HAMLET. I prithee do not mock me, fellow-student. I think it was to see my mother’s wedding.  HORATIO. Indeed, my lord, it follow’d hard upon.  HAMLET. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak’d meats Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables. Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio. My father,—methinks I see my father.  HORATIO. Where, my lord?  HAMLET. In my mind’s eye, Horatio.  HORATIO. I saw him once; he was a goodly king.  HAMLET. He was a man, take him for all in all, I shall not look upon his like again.  HORATIO. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.  HAMLET. Saw? Who?  HORATIO. My lord, the King your father.  HAMLET. The King my father!  HORATIO. Season your admiration for a while With an attent ear, till I may deliver Upon the witness of these gentlemen This marvel to you.  HAMLET. For God’s love let me hear.  HORATIO. Two nights together had these gentlemen, Marcellus and Barnardo, on their watch In the dead waste and middle of the night, Been thus encounter’d. A figure like your father, Armed at point exactly, cap-à-pie, Appears before them, and with solemn march Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk’d By their oppress’d and fear-surprised eyes, Within his truncheon’s length; whilst they, distill’d Almost to jelly with the act of fear, Stand dumb, and speak not to him. This to me In dreadful secrecy impart they did, And I with them the third night kept the watch, Where, as they had deliver’d, both in time, Form of the thing, each word made true and good, The apparition comes. I knew your father; These hands are not more like.  HAMLET. But where was this?  MARCELLUS. My lord, upon the platform where we watch.  HAMLET. Did you not speak to it?  HORATIO. My lord, I did; But answer made it none: yet once methought It lifted up it head, and did address Itself to motion, like as it would speak. But even then the morning cock crew loud, And at the sound it shrunk in haste away, And vanish’d from our sight.  HAMLET. ’Tis very strange.  HORATIO. As I do live, my honour’d lord, ’tis true; And we did think it writ down in our duty To let you know of it.  HAMLET. Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me. Hold you the watch tonight?  MARCELLUS and BARNARDO. We do, my lord.  HAMLET. Arm’d, say you?  Both. Arm’d, my lord.  HAMLET. From top to toe?  BOTH. My lord, from head to foot.  HAMLET. Then saw you not his face?  HORATIO. O yes, my lord, he wore his beaver up.  HAMLET. What, look’d he frowningly?  HORATIO. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.  HAMLET. Pale, or red?  HORATIO. Nay, very pale.  HAMLET. And fix’d his eyes upon you?  HORATIO. Most constantly.  HAMLET. I would I had been there.  HORATIO. It would have much amaz’d you.  HAMLET. Very like, very like. Stay’d it long?  HORATIO. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.  MARCELLUS and BARNARDO. Longer, longer.  HORATIO. Not when I saw’t.  HAMLET. His beard was grizzled, no?  HORATIO. It was, as I have seen it in his life, A sable silver’d.  HAMLET. I will watch tonight; Perchance ’twill walk again.  HORATIO. I warrant you it will.  HAMLET. If it assume my noble father’s person, I’ll speak to it, though hell itself should gape And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all, If you have hitherto conceal’d this sight, Let it be tenable in your silence still; And whatsoever else shall hap tonight, Give it an understanding, but no tongue. I will requite your loves. So, fare ye well. Upon the platform ’twixt eleven and twelve, I’ll visit you.  ALL. Our duty to your honour.  HAMLET. Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.  [_Exeunt Horatio, Marcellus and Barnardo._]  My father’s spirit in arms! All is not well; I doubt some foul play: would the night were come! Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise, Though all the earth o’erwhelm them, to men’s eyes.  [_Exit._]   SCENE III. A room in Polonius’s house.  Enter Laertes and Ophelia.  LAERTES. My necessaries are embark’d. Farewell. And, sister, as the winds give benefit And convoy is assistant, do not sleep, But let me hear from you.  OPHELIA. Do you doubt that?  LAERTES. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour, Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood; A violet in the youth of primy nature, Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting; The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.  OPHELIA. No more but so?  LAERTES. Think it no more. For nature crescent does not grow alone In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes, The inward service of the mind and soul Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now, And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch The virtue of his will; but you must fear, His greatness weigh’d, his will is not his own; For he himself is subject to his birth: He may not, as unvalu’d persons do, Carve for himself; for on his choice depends The sanctity and health of this whole state; And therefore must his choice be circumscrib’d Unto the voice and yielding of that body Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you, It fits your wisdom so far to believe it As he in his particular act and place May give his saying deed; which is no further Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal. Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain If with too credent ear you list his songs, Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open To his unmaster’d importunity. Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister; And keep you in the rear of your affection, Out of the shot and danger of desire. The chariest maid is prodigal enough If she unmask her beauty to the moon. Virtue itself ’scapes not calumnious strokes: The canker galls the infants of the spring Too oft before their buttons be disclos’d, And in the morn and liquid dew of youth Contagious blastments are most imminent. Be wary then, best safety lies in fear. Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.  OPHELIA. I shall th’effect of this good lesson keep As watchman to my heart. But good my brother, Do not as some ungracious pastors do, Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven; Whilst like a puff’d and reckless libertine Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads, And recks not his own rede.  LAERTES. O, fear me not. I stay too long. But here my father comes.  Enter Polonius.  A double blessing is a double grace; Occasion smiles upon a second leave.  POLONIUS. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame. The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail, And you are stay’d for. There, my blessing with you.  [_Laying his hand on Laertes’s head._]  And these few precepts in thy memory Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue, Nor any unproportion’d thought his act. Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar. Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried, Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel; But do not dull thy palm with entertainment Of each new-hatch’d, unfledg’d comrade. Beware Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in, Bear’t that th’opposed may beware of thee. Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice: Take each man’s censure, but reserve thy judgement. Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy, But not express’d in fancy; rich, not gaudy: For the apparel oft proclaims the man; And they in France of the best rank and station Are of a most select and generous chief in that. Neither a borrower nor a lender be: For loan oft loses both itself and friend; And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry. This above all: to thine own self be true; And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man. Farewell: my blessing season this in thee.  LAERTES. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.  POLONIUS. The time invites you; go, your servants tend.  LAERTES. Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well What I have said to you.  OPHELIA. ’Tis in my memory lock’d, And you yourself shall keep the key of it.  LAERTES. Farewell.  [_Exit._]  POLONIUS. What is’t, Ophelia, he hath said to you?  OPHELIA. So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.  POLONIUS. Marry, well bethought: ’Tis told me he hath very oft of late Given private time to you; and you yourself Have of your audience been most free and bounteous. If it be so,—as so ’tis put on me, And that in way of caution,—I must tell you You do not understand yourself so clearly As it behoves my daughter and your honour. What is between you? Give me up the truth.  OPHELIA. He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders Of his affection to me.  POLONIUS. Affection! Pooh! You speak like a green girl, Unsifted in such perilous circumstance. Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?  OPHELIA. I do not know, my lord, what I should think.  POLONIUS. Marry, I’ll teach you; think yourself a baby; That you have ta’en these tenders for true pay, Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly; Or,—not to crack the wind of the poor phrase, Running it thus,—you’ll tender me a fool.  OPHELIA. My lord, he hath importun’d me with love In honourable fashion.  POLONIUS. Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.  OPHELIA. And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord, With almost all the holy vows of heaven.  POLONIUS. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know, When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter, Giving more light than heat, extinct in both, Even in their promise, as it is a-making, You must not take for fire. From this time Be something scanter of your maiden presence; Set your entreatments at a higher rate Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet, Believe so much in him that he is young; And with a larger tether may he walk Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia, Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers, Not of that dye which their investments show, But mere implorators of unholy suits, Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds, The better to beguile. This is for all: I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth Have you so slander any moment leisure As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet. Look to’t, I charge you; come your ways.  OPHELIA. I shall obey, my lord.  [_Exeunt._]   SCENE IV. The platform.  Enter Hamlet, Horatio and Marcellus.  HAMLET. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.  HORATIO. It is a nipping and an eager air.  HAMLET. What hour now?  HORATIO. I think it lacks of twelve.  MARCELLUS. No, it is struck.  HORATIO. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.  [_A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off within._]  What does this mean, my lord?  HAMLET. The King doth wake tonight and takes his rouse, Keeps wassail, and the swaggering upspring reels; And as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down, The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out The triumph of his pledge.  HORATIO. Is it a custom?  HAMLET. Ay marry is’t; And to my mind, though I am native here, And to the manner born, it is a custom More honour’d in the breach than the observance. This heavy-headed revel east and west Makes us traduc’d and tax’d of other nations: They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase Soil our addition; and indeed it takes From our achievements, though perform’d at height, The pith and marrow of our attribute. So oft it chances in particular men That for some vicious mole of nature in them, As in their birth, wherein they are not guilty, Since nature cannot choose his origin, By their o’ergrowth of some complexion, Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason; Or by some habit, that too much o’erleavens The form of plausive manners;—that these men, Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect, Being Nature’s livery or Fortune’s star,— His virtues else,—be they as pure as grace, As infinite as man may undergo, Shall in the general censure take corruption From that particular fault. The dram of evil Doth all the noble substance of a doubt To his own scandal.  HORATIO. Look, my lord, it comes!  Enter Ghost.  HAMLET. Angels and ministers of grace defend us! Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn’d, Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell, Be thy intents wicked or charitable, Thou com’st in such a questionable shape That I will speak to thee. I’ll call thee Hamlet, King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me! Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell Why thy canoniz’d bones, hearsed in death, Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre, Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn’d, Hath op’d his ponderous and marble jaws To cast thee up again! What may this mean, That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel, Revisit’st thus the glimpses of the moon, Making night hideous, and we fools of nature So horridly to shake our disposition With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls? Say, why is this? Wherefore? What should we do?  [_Ghost beckons Hamlet._]  HORATIO. It beckons you to go away with it, As if it some impartment did desire To you alone.  MARCELLUS. Look with what courteous action It waves you to a more removed ground. But do not go with it.  HORATIO. No, by no means.  HAMLET. It will not speak; then will I follow it.  HORATIO. Do not, my lord.  HAMLET. Why, what should be the fear? I do not set my life at a pin’s fee; And for my soul, what can it do to that, Being a thing immortal as itself? It waves me forth again. I’ll follow it.  HORATIO. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord, Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff That beetles o’er his base into the sea, And there assume some other horrible form Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason, And draw you into madness? Think of it. The very place puts toys of desperation, Without more motive, into every brain That looks so many fathoms to the sea And hears it roar beneath.  HAMLET. It waves me still. Go on, I’ll follow thee.  MARCELLUS. You shall not go, my lord.  HAMLET. Hold off your hands.  HORATIO. Be rul’d; you shall not go.  HAMLET. My fate cries out, And makes each petty artery in this body As hardy as the Nemean lion’s nerve.  [_Ghost beckons._]  Still am I call’d. Unhand me, gentlemen.  [_Breaking free from them._]  By heaven, I’ll make a ghost of him that lets me. I say, away!—Go on, I’ll follow thee.  [_Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet._]  HORATIO. He waxes desperate with imagination.  MARCELLUS. Let’s follow; ’tis not fit thus to obey him.  HORATIO. Have after. To what issue will this come?  MARCELLUS. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.  HORATIO. Heaven will direct it.  MARCELLUS. Nay, let’s follow him.  [_Exeunt._]   SCENE V. A more remote part of the Castle.  Enter Ghost and Hamlet.  HAMLET. Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak, I’ll go no further.  GHOST. Mark me.  HAMLET. I will.  GHOST. My hour is almost come, When I to sulph’rous and tormenting flames Must render up myself.  HAMLET. Alas, poor ghost!  GHOST. Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing To what I shall unfold.  HAMLET. Speak, I am bound to hear.  GHOST. So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.  HAMLET. What?  GHOST. I am thy father’s spirit, Doom’d for a certain term to walk the night, And for the day confin’d to fast in fires, Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature Are burnt and purg’d away. But that I am forbid To tell the secrets of my prison-house, I could a tale unfold whose lightest word Would harrow up thy soul; freeze thy young blood, Make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres, Thy knotted and combined locks to part, And each particular hair to stand on end Like quills upon the fretful porpentine. But this eternal blazon must not be To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list! If thou didst ever thy dear father love—  HAMLET. O God!  GHOST. Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.  HAMLET. Murder!  GHOST. Murder most foul, as in the best it is; But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.  HAMLET. Haste me to know’t, that I, with wings as swift As meditation or the thoughts of love May sweep to my revenge.  GHOST. I find thee apt; And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf, Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear. ’Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard, A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark Is by a forged process of my death Rankly abus’d; but know, thou noble youth, The serpent that did sting thy father’s life Now wears his crown.  HAMLET. O my prophetic soul! Mine uncle!  GHOST. Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast, With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,— O wicked wit, and gifts, that have the power So to seduce!—won to his shameful lust The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen. O Hamlet, what a falling off was there, From me, whose love was of that dignity That it went hand in hand even with the vow I made to her in marriage; and to decline Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor To those of mine. But virtue, as it never will be mov’d, Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven; So lust, though to a radiant angel link’d, Will sate itself in a celestial bed And prey on garbage. But soft! methinks I scent the morning air; Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard, My custom always of the afternoon, Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial, And in the porches of my ears did pour The leperous distilment, whose effect Holds such an enmity with blood of man That swift as quicksilver it courses through The natural gates and alleys of the body; And with a sudden vigour it doth posset And curd, like eager droppings into milk, The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine; And a most instant tetter bark’d about, Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust All my smooth body. Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother’s hand, Of life, of crown, of queen at once dispatch’d: Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin, Unhous’led, disappointed, unanel’d; No reckoning made, but sent to my account With all my imperfections on my head. O horrible! O horrible! most horrible! If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not; Let not the royal bed of Denmark be A couch for luxury and damned incest. But howsoever thou pursu’st this act, Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive Against thy mother aught; leave her to heaven, And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge, To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once! The glow-worm shows the matin to be near, And ’gins to pale his uneffectual fire. Adieu, adieu, adieu. Remember me.  [_Exit._]  HAMLET. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else? And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, my heart; And you, my sinews, grow not instant old, But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee? Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat In this distracted globe. Remember thee? Yea, from the table of my memory I’ll wipe away all trivial fond records, All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past, That youth and observation copied there; And thy commandment all alone shall live Within the book and volume of my brain, Unmix’d with baser matter. Yes, by heaven! O most pernicious woman! O villain, villain, smiling damned villain! My tables. Meet it is I set it down, That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain! At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.  [_Writing._]  So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word; It is ‘Adieu, adieu, remember me.’ I have sworn’t.  HORATIO and MARCELLUS. [_Within._] My lord, my lord.  MARCELLUS. [_Within._] Lord Hamlet.  HORATIO. [_Within._] Heaven secure him.  HAMLET. So be it!  MARCELLUS. [_Within._] Illo, ho, ho, my lord!  HAMLET. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.  Enter Horatio and Marcellus.  MARCELLUS. How is’t, my noble lord?  HORATIO. What news, my lord?  HAMLET. O, wonderful!  HORATIO. Good my lord, tell it.  HAMLET. No, you’ll reveal it.  HORATIO. Not I, my lord, by heaven.  MARCELLUS. Nor I, my lord.  HAMLET. How say you then, would heart of man once think it?— But you’ll be secret?  HORATIO and MARCELLUS. Ay, by heaven, my lord.  HAMLET. There’s ne’er a villain dwelling in all Denmark But he’s an arrant knave.  HORATIO. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave To tell us this.  HAMLET. Why, right; you are i’ the right; And so, without more circumstance at all, I hold it fit that we shake hands and part: You, as your business and desire shall point you,— For every man hath business and desire, Such as it is;—and for my own poor part, Look you, I’ll go pray.  HORATIO. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.  HAMLET. I’m sorry they offend you, heartily; Yes faith, heartily.  HORATIO. There’s no offence, my lord.  HAMLET. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio, And much offence too. Touching this vision here, It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you. For your desire to know what is between us, O’ermaster’t as you may. And now, good friends, As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers, Give me one poor request.  HORATIO. What is’t, my lord? We will.  HAMLET. Never make known what you have seen tonight.  HORATIO and MARCELLUS. My lord, we will not.  HAMLET. Nay, but swear’t.  HORATIO. In faith, my lord, not I.  MARCELLUS. Nor I, my lord, in faith.  HAMLET. Upon my sword.  MARCELLUS. We have sworn, my lord, already.  HAMLET. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.  GHOST. [_Cries under the stage._] Swear.  HAMLET. Ha, ha boy, sayst thou so? Art thou there, truepenny? Come on, you hear this fellow in the cellarage. Consent to swear.  HORATIO. Propose the oath, my lord.  HAMLET. Never to speak of this that you have seen. Swear by my sword.  GHOST. [_Beneath._] Swear.  HAMLET. _Hic et ubique?_ Then we’ll shift our ground. Come hither, gentlemen, And lay your hands again upon my sword. Never to speak of this that you have heard. Swear by my sword.  GHOST. [_Beneath._] Swear.  HAMLET. Well said, old mole! Canst work i’ th’earth so fast? A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.  HORATIO. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange.  HAMLET. And therefore as a stranger give it welcome. There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come, Here, as before, never, so help you mercy, How strange or odd soe’er I bear myself,— As I perchance hereafter shall think meet To put an antic disposition on— That you, at such times seeing me, never shall, With arms encumber’d thus, or this head-shake, Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase, As ‘Well, we know’, or ‘We could and if we would’, Or ‘If we list to speak’; or ‘There be and if they might’, Or such ambiguous giving out, to note That you know aught of me:—this not to do. So grace and mercy at your most need help you, Swear.  GHOST. [_Beneath._] Swear.  HAMLET. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit. So, gentlemen, With all my love I do commend me to you; And what so poor a man as Hamlet is May do t’express his love and friending to you, God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together, And still your fingers on your lips, I pray. The time is out of joint. O cursed spite, That ever I was born to set it right. Nay, come, let’s go together.  [_Exeunt._]
  ACT II  SCENE I. A room in Polonius’s house.
Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.  POLONIUS. Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.  REYNALDO. I will, my lord.  POLONIUS. You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo, Before you visit him, to make inquiry Of his behaviour.  REYNALDO. My lord, I did intend it.  POLONIUS. Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir, Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris; And how, and who, what means, and where they keep, What company, at what expense; and finding By this encompassment and drift of question, That they do know my son, come you more nearer Than your particular demands will touch it. Take you as ’twere some distant knowledge of him, As thus, ‘I know his father and his friends, And in part him’—do you mark this, Reynaldo?  REYNALDO. Ay, very well, my lord.  POLONIUS. ‘And in part him, but,’ you may say, ‘not well; But if’t be he I mean, he’s very wild; Addicted so and so;’ and there put on him What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank As may dishonour him; take heed of that; But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips As are companions noted and most known To youth and liberty.  REYNALDO. As gaming, my lord?  POLONIUS. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, Quarrelling, drabbing. You may go so far.  REYNALDO. My lord, that would dishonour him.  POLONIUS. Faith no, as you may season it in the charge. You must not put another scandal on him, That he is open to incontinency; That’s not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly That they may seem the taints of liberty; The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind, A savageness in unreclaimed blood, Of general assault.  REYNALDO. But my good lord—  POLONIUS. Wherefore should you do this?  REYNALDO. Ay, my lord, I would know that.  POLONIUS. Marry, sir, here’s my drift, And I believe it is a fetch of warrant. You laying these slight sullies on my son, As ’twere a thing a little soil’d i’ th’ working, Mark you, Your party in converse, him you would sound, Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur’d He closes with you in this consequence; ‘Good sir,’ or so; or ‘friend,’ or ‘gentleman’— According to the phrase or the addition Of man and country.  REYNALDO. Very good, my lord.  POLONIUS. And then, sir, does he this,— He does—What was I about to say? By the mass, I was about to say something. Where did I leave?  REYNALDO. At ‘closes in the consequence.’ At ‘friend or so,’ and ‘gentleman.’  POLONIUS. At ‘closes in the consequence’ ay, marry! He closes with you thus: ‘I know the gentleman, I saw him yesterday, or t’other day, Or then, or then, with such and such; and, as you say, There was he gaming, there o’ertook in’s rouse, There falling out at tennis’: or perchance, ‘I saw him enter such a house of sale’— _Videlicet_, a brothel, or so forth. See you now; Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth; And thus do we of wisdom and of reach, With windlasses, and with assays of bias, By indirections find directions out. So by my former lecture and advice Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?  REYNALDO. My lord, I have.  POLONIUS. God b’ wi’ you, fare you well.  REYNALDO. Good my lord.  POLONIUS. Observe his inclination in yourself.  REYNALDO. I shall, my lord.  POLONIUS. And let him ply his music.  REYNALDO. Well, my lord.  POLONIUS. Farewell.  [_Exit Reynaldo._]  Enter Ophelia.  How now, Ophelia, what’s the matter?  OPHELIA. Alas, my lord, I have been so affrighted.  POLONIUS. With what, in the name of God?  OPHELIA. My lord, as I was sewing in my chamber, Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac’d, No hat upon his head, his stockings foul’d, Ungart’red, and down-gyved to his ankle, Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other, And with a look so piteous in purport As if he had been loosed out of hell To speak of horrors, he comes before me.  POLONIUS. Mad for thy love?  OPHELIA. My lord, I do not know, but truly I do fear it.  POLONIUS. What said he?  OPHELIA. He took me by the wrist and held me hard; Then goes he to the length of all his arm; And with his other hand thus o’er his brow, He falls to such perusal of my face As he would draw it. Long stay’d he so, At last,—a little shaking of mine arm, And thrice his head thus waving up and down, He rais’d a sigh so piteous and profound As it did seem to shatter all his bulk And end his being. That done, he lets me go, And with his head over his shoulder turn’d He seem’d to find his way without his eyes, For out o’ doors he went without their help, And to the last bended their light on me.  POLONIUS. Come, go with me. I will go seek the King. This is the very ecstasy of love, Whose violent property fordoes itself, And leads the will to desperate undertakings, As oft as any passion under heaven That does afflict our natures. I am sorry,— What, have you given him any hard words of late?  OPHELIA. No, my good lord; but as you did command, I did repel his letters and denied His access to me.  POLONIUS. That hath made him mad. I am sorry that with better heed and judgement I had not quoted him. I fear’d he did but trifle, And meant to wreck thee. But beshrew my jealousy! It seems it is as proper to our age To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions As it is common for the younger sort To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King. This must be known, which, being kept close, might move More grief to hide than hate to utter love.  [_Exeunt._]   SCENE II. A room in the Castle.  Enter King, Queen, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern and Attendants.  KING. Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Moreover that we much did long to see you, The need we have to use you did provoke Our hasty sending. Something have you heard Of Hamlet’s transformation; so I call it, Since nor th’exterior nor the inward man Resembles that it was. What it should be, More than his father’s death, that thus hath put him So much from th’understanding of himself, I cannot dream of. I entreat you both That, being of so young days brought up with him, And since so neighbour’d to his youth and humour, That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court Some little time, so by your companies To draw him on to pleasures and to gather, So much as from occasion you may glean, Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus That, open’d, lies within our remedy.  QUEEN. Good gentlemen, he hath much talk’d of you, And sure I am, two men there are not living To whom he more adheres. If it will please you To show us so much gentry and good will As to expend your time with us awhile, For the supply and profit of our hope, Your visitation shall receive such thanks As fits a king’s remembrance.  ROSENCRANTZ. Both your majesties Might, by the sovereign power you have of us, Put your dread pleasures more into command Than to entreaty.  GUILDENSTERN. We both obey, And here give up ourselves, in the full bent, To lay our service freely at your feet To be commanded.  KING. Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.  QUEEN. Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz. And I beseech you instantly to visit My too much changed son. Go, some of you, And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.  GUILDENSTERN. Heavens make our presence and our practices Pleasant and helpful to him.  QUEEN. Ay, amen.  [_Exeunt Rosencrantz, Guildenstern and some Attendants._]  Enter Polonius.  POLONIUS. Th’ambassadors from Norway, my good lord, Are joyfully return’d.  KING. Thou still hast been the father of good news.  POLONIUS. Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege, I hold my duty, as I hold my soul, Both to my God and to my gracious King: And I do think,—or else this brain of mine Hunts not the trail of policy so sure As it hath us’d to do—that I have found The very cause of Hamlet’s lunacy.  KING. O speak of that, that do I long to hear.  POLONIUS. Give first admittance to th’ambassadors; My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.  KING. Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.  [_Exit Polonius._]  He tells me, my sweet queen, that he hath found The head and source of all your son’s distemper.  QUEEN. I doubt it is no other but the main, His father’s death and our o’erhasty marriage.  KING. Well, we shall sift him.  Enter Polonius with Voltemand and Cornelius.  Welcome, my good friends! Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?  VOLTEMAND. Most fair return of greetings and desires. Upon our first, he sent out to suppress His nephew’s levies, which to him appear’d To be a preparation ’gainst the Polack; But better look’d into, he truly found It was against your Highness; whereat griev’d, That so his sickness, age, and impotence Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys, Receives rebuke from Norway; and in fine, Makes vow before his uncle never more To give th’assay of arms against your Majesty. Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy, Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee, And his commission to employ those soldiers So levied as before, against the Polack: With an entreaty, herein further shown, [_Gives a paper._] That it might please you to give quiet pass Through your dominions for this enterprise, On such regards of safety and allowance As therein are set down.  KING. It likes us well; And at our more consider’d time we’ll read, Answer, and think upon this business. Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour. Go to your rest, at night we’ll feast together:. Most welcome home.  [_Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius._]  POLONIUS. This business is well ended. My liege and madam, to expostulate What majesty should be, what duty is, Why day is day, night night, and time is time Were nothing but to waste night, day and time. Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit, And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes, I will be brief. Your noble son is mad. Mad call I it; for to define true madness, What is’t but to be nothing else but mad? But let that go.  QUEEN. More matter, with less art.  POLONIUS. Madam, I swear I use no art at all. That he is mad, ’tis true: ’tis true ’tis pity; And pity ’tis ’tis true. A foolish figure, But farewell it, for I will use no art. Mad let us grant him then. And now remains That we find out the cause of this effect, Or rather say, the cause of this defect, For this effect defective comes by cause. Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend, I have a daughter—have whilst she is mine— Who in her duty and obedience, mark, Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise. [_Reads._] _To the celestial, and my soul’s idol, the most beautified Ophelia_— That’s an ill phrase, a vile phrase; ‘beautified’ is a vile phrase: but you shall hear. [_Reads._] _these; in her excellent white bosom, these, &c._  QUEEN. Came this from Hamlet to her?  POLONIUS. Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful. [_Reads._]   _Doubt thou the stars are fire,      Doubt that the sun doth move,    Doubt truth to be a liar,      But never doubt I love. O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers. I have not art to reckon my groans. But that I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.   Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him,      HAMLET._ This in obedience hath my daughter show’d me; And more above, hath his solicitings, As they fell out by time, by means, and place, All given to mine ear.  KING. But how hath she receiv’d his love?  POLONIUS. What do you think of me?  KING. As of a man faithful and honourable.  POLONIUS. I would fain prove so. But what might you think, When I had seen this hot love on the wing, As I perceiv’d it, I must tell you that, Before my daughter told me, what might you, Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think, If I had play’d the desk or table-book, Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb, Or look’d upon this love with idle sight, What might you think? No, I went round to work, And my young mistress thus I did bespeak: ‘Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star. This must not be.’ And then I precepts gave her, That she should lock herself from his resort, Admit no messengers, receive no tokens. Which done, she took the fruits of my advice, And he, repulsed,—a short tale to make— Fell into a sadness, then into a fast, Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness, Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension, Into the madness wherein now he raves, And all we wail for.  KING. Do you think ’tis this?  QUEEN. It may be, very likely.  POLONIUS. Hath there been such a time, I’d fain know that, That I have positively said ‘’Tis so,’ When it prov’d otherwise?  KING. Not that I know.  POLONIUS. Take this from this, if this be otherwise. [_Points to his head and shoulder._] If circumstances lead me, I will find Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed Within the centre.  KING. How may we try it further?  POLONIUS. You know sometimes he walks four hours together Here in the lobby.  QUEEN. So he does indeed.  POLONIUS. At such a time I’ll loose my daughter to him. Be you and I behind an arras then, Mark the encounter. If he love her not, And be not from his reason fall’n thereon, Let me be no assistant for a state, But keep a farm and carters.  KING. We will try it.  Enter Hamlet, reading.  QUEEN. But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.  POLONIUS. Away, I do beseech you, both away I’ll board him presently. O, give me leave.  [_Exeunt King, Queen and Attendants._]  How does my good Lord Hamlet?  HAMLET. Well, God-a-mercy.  POLONIUS. Do you know me, my lord?  HAMLET. Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.  POLONIUS. Not I, my lord.  HAMLET. Then I would you were so honest a man.  POLONIUS. Honest, my lord?  HAMLET. Ay sir, to be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man picked out of ten thousand.  POLONIUS. That’s very true, my lord.  HAMLET. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a good kissing carrion,— Have you a daughter?  POLONIUS. I have, my lord.  HAMLET. Let her not walk i’ th’ sun. Conception is a blessing, but not as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to’t.  POLONIUS. How say you by that? [_Aside._] Still harping on my daughter. Yet he knew me not at first; he said I was a fishmonger. He is far gone, far gone. And truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for love; very near this. I’ll speak to him again.—What do you read, my lord?  HAMLET. Words, words, words.  POLONIUS. What is the matter, my lord?  HAMLET. Between who?  POLONIUS. I mean the matter that you read, my lord.  HAMLET. Slanders, sir. For the satirical slave says here that old men have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams. All which, sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down. For you yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab you could go backward.  POLONIUS. [_Aside._] Though this be madness, yet there is method in’t.— Will you walk out of the air, my lord?  HAMLET. Into my grave?  POLONIUS. Indeed, that is out o’ the air. [_Aside._] How pregnant sometimes his replies are! A happiness that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter. My honourable lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.  HAMLET. You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more willingly part withal, except my life, except my life, except my life.  POLONIUS. Fare you well, my lord.  HAMLET. These tedious old fools.  Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.  POLONIUS. You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.  ROSENCRANTZ. [_To Polonius._] God save you, sir.  [_Exit Polonius._]  GUILDENSTERN. My honoured lord!  ROSENCRANTZ. My most dear lord!  HAMLET. My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz. Good lads, how do ye both?  ROSENCRANTZ. As the indifferent children of the earth.  GUILDENSTERN. Happy in that we are not over-happy; On Fortune’s cap we are not the very button.  HAMLET. Nor the soles of her shoe?  ROSENCRANTZ. Neither, my lord.  HAMLET. Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her favours?  GUILDENSTERN. Faith, her privates we.  HAMLET. In the secret parts of Fortune? O, most true; she is a strumpet. What’s the news?  ROSENCRANTZ. None, my lord, but that the world’s grown honest.  HAMLET. Then is doomsday near. But your news is not true. Let me question more in particular. What have you, my good friends, deserved at the hands of Fortune, that she sends you to prison hither?  GUILDENSTERN. Prison, my lord?  HAMLET. Denmark’s a prison.  ROSENCRANTZ. Then is the world one.  HAMLET. A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and dungeons, Denmark being one o’ th’ worst.  ROSENCRANTZ. We think not so, my lord.  HAMLET. Why, then ’tis none to you; for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.  ROSENCRANTZ. Why, then your ambition makes it one; ’tis too narrow for your mind.  HAMLET. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell, and count myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.  GUILDENSTERN. Which dreams, indeed, are ambition; for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.  HAMLET. A dream itself is but a shadow.  ROSENCRANTZ. Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow’s shadow.  HAMLET. Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch’d heroes the beggars’ shadows. Shall we to th’ court? For, by my fay, I cannot reason.  ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN. We’ll wait upon you.  HAMLET. No such matter. I will not sort you with the rest of my servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?  ROSENCRANTZ. To visit you, my lord, no other occasion.  HAMLET. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you. And sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come, deal justly with me. Come, come; nay, speak.  GUILDENSTERN. What should we say, my lord?  HAMLET. Why, anything. But to the purpose. You were sent for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties have not craft enough to colour. I know the good King and Queen have sent for you.  ROSENCRANTZ. To what end, my lord?  HAMLET. That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct with me, whether you were sent for or no.  ROSENCRANTZ. [_To Guildenstern._] What say you?  HAMLET. [_Aside._] Nay, then I have an eye of you. If you love me, hold not off.  GUILDENSTERN. My lord, we were sent for.  HAMLET. I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no feather. I have of late, but wherefore I know not, lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy the air, look you, this brave o’erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a piece of work is man, how noble in reason, how infinite in faculties, in form and moving, how express and admirable; in action how like an angel, in apprehension, how like a god: the beauty of the world, the paragon of animals. And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me; no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.  ROSENCRANTZ. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.  HAMLET. Why did you laugh then, when I said ‘Man delights not me’?  ROSENCRANTZ. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what Lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you. We coted them on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service.  HAMLET. He that plays the king shall be welcome,—his Majesty shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not sigh gratis, the humorous man shall end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle o’ th’ sere; and the lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt for’t. What players are they?  ROSENCRANTZ. Even those you were wont to take such delight in—the tragedians of the city.  HAMLET. How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in reputation and profit, was better both ways.  ROSENCRANTZ. I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation.  HAMLET. Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city? Are they so followed?  ROSENCRANTZ. No, indeed, they are not.  HAMLET. How comes it? Do they grow rusty?  ROSENCRANTZ. Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there is, sir, an aerie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top of question, and are most tyrannically clapped for’t. These are now the fashion, and so berattle the common stages—so they call them—that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.  HAMLET. What, are they children? Who maintains ’em? How are they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common players—as it is most like, if their means are no better—their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession?  ROSENCRANTZ. Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy. There was for a while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question.  HAMLET. Is’t possible?  GUILDENSTERN. O, there has been much throwing about of brains.  HAMLET. Do the boys carry it away?  ROSENCRANTZ. Ay, that they do, my lord. Hercules and his load too.  HAMLET. It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little. ’Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if philosophy could find it out.  [_Flourish of trumpets within._]  GUILDENSTERN. There are the players.  HAMLET. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come. The appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me comply with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players, which I tell you must show fairly outward, should more appear like entertainment than yours. You are welcome. But my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.  GUILDENSTERN. In what, my dear lord?  HAMLET. I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly, I know a hawk from a handsaw.  Enter Polonius.  POLONIUS. Well be with you, gentlemen.  HAMLET. Hark you, Guildenstern, and you too, at each ear a hearer. That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts.  ROSENCRANTZ. Happily he’s the second time come to them; for they say an old man is twice a child.  HAMLET. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark it.—You say right, sir: for a Monday morning ’twas so indeed.  POLONIUS. My lord, I have news to tell you.  HAMLET. My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in Rome—  POLONIUS. The actors are come hither, my lord.  HAMLET. Buzz, buzz.  POLONIUS. Upon my honour.  HAMLET. Then came each actor on his ass—  POLONIUS. The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light, for the law of writ and the liberty. These are the only men.  HAMLET. O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!  POLONIUS. What treasure had he, my lord?  HAMLET. Why—    ’One fair daughter, and no more,    The which he loved passing well.’  POLONIUS. [_Aside._] Still on my daughter.  HAMLET. Am I not i’ th’ right, old Jephthah?  POLONIUS. If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I love passing well.  HAMLET. Nay, that follows not.  POLONIUS. What follows then, my lord?  HAMLET. Why,    As by lot, God wot, and then, you know,    It came to pass, as most like it was. The first row of the pious chanson will show you more. For look where my abridgement comes.  Enter four or five Players.  You are welcome, masters, welcome all. I am glad to see thee well. Welcome, good friends. O, my old friend! Thy face is valanc’d since I saw thee last. Com’st thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young lady and mistress! By’r lady, your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a piece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We’ll e’en to’t like French falconers, fly at anything we see. We’ll have a speech straight. Come, give us a taste of your quality. Come, a passionate speech.  FIRST PLAYER. What speech, my lord?  HAMLET. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted, or if it was, not above once, for the play, I remember, pleased not the million, ’twas caviare to the general. But it was—as I received it, and others, whose judgements in such matters cried in the top of mine—an excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might indite the author of affectation, but called it an honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in it, I chiefly loved. ’Twas Aeneas’ tale to Dido, and thereabout of it especially where he speaks of Priam’s slaughter. If it live in your memory, begin at this line, let me see, let me see:    _The rugged Pyrrhus, like th’ Hyrcanian beast,—_ It is not so: it begins with Pyrrhus—    _The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,    Black as his purpose, did the night resemble    When he lay couched in the ominous horse,    Hath now this dread and black complexion smear’d    With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot    Now is he total gules, horridly trick’d    With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,    Bak’d and impasted with the parching streets,    That lend a tyrannous and a damned light    To their vile murders. Roasted in wrath and fire,    And thus o’ersized with coagulate gore,    With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus    Old grandsire Priam seeks._ So, proceed you.  POLONIUS. ’Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good discretion.  FIRST PLAYER.    _Anon he finds him,    Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,    Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,    Repugnant to command. Unequal match’d,    Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;    But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword    Th’unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,    Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top    Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash    Takes prisoner Pyrrhus’ ear. For lo, his sword,    Which was declining on the milky head    Of reverend Priam, seem’d i’ th’air to stick.    So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,    And like a neutral to his will and matter,    Did nothing.    But as we often see against some storm,    A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,    The bold winds speechless, and the orb below    As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder    Doth rend the region; so after Pyrrhus’ pause,    Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work,    And never did the Cyclops’ hammers fall    On Mars’s armour, forg’d for proof eterne,    With less remorse than Pyrrhus’ bleeding sword    Now falls on Priam.    Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,    In general synod, take away her power;    Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,    And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,    As low as to the fiends._  POLONIUS. This is too long.  HAMLET. It shall to the barber’s, with your beard.—Prithee say on. He’s for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on; come to Hecuba.  FIRST PLAYER.    _But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen,—_  HAMLET. ‘The mobled queen’?  POLONIUS. That’s good! ‘Mobled queen’ is good.  FIRST PLAYER.    _Run barefoot up and down, threat’ning the flames    With bisson rheum. A clout upon that head    Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,    About her lank and all o’erteemed loins,    A blanket, in th’alarm of fear caught up—    Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep’d,    ’Gainst Fortune’s state would treason have pronounc’d.    But if the gods themselves did see her then,    When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport    In mincing with his sword her husband’s limbs,    The instant burst of clamour that she made,—    Unless things mortal move them not at all,—    Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,    And passion in the gods._  POLONIUS. Look, where he has not turn’d his colour, and has tears in’s eyes. Pray you, no more.  HAMLET. ’Tis well. I’ll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.—Good my lord, will you see the players well bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for they are the abstracts and brief chronicles of the time. After your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.  POLONIUS. My lord, I will use them according to their desert.  HAMLET. God’s bodikin, man, much better. Use every man after his desert, and who should ’scape whipping? Use them after your own honour and dignity. The less they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty. Take them in.  POLONIUS. Come, sirs.  HAMLET. Follow him, friends. We’ll hear a play tomorrow.  [_Exeunt Polonius with all the Players but the First._]  Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play _The Murder of Gonzago_?  FIRST PLAYER. Ay, my lord.  HAMLET. We’ll ha’t tomorrow night. You could for a need study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which I would set down and insert in’t, could you not?  FIRST PLAYER. Ay, my lord.  HAMLET. Very well. Follow that lord, and look you mock him not.  [_Exit First Player._]  [_To Rosencrantz and Guildenstern_] My good friends, I’ll leave you till night. You are welcome to Elsinore.  ROSENCRANTZ. Good my lord.  [_Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern._]  HAMLET. Ay, so, God b’ wi’ ye. Now I am alone. O what a rogue and peasant slave am I! Is it not monstrous that this player here, But in a fiction, in a dream of passion, Could force his soul so to his own conceit That from her working all his visage wan’d; Tears in his eyes, distraction in’s aspect, A broken voice, and his whole function suiting With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing! For Hecuba? What’s Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba, That he should weep for her? What would he do, Had he the motive and the cue for passion That I have? He would drown the stage with tears And cleave the general ear with horrid speech; Make mad the guilty, and appal the free, Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed, The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I, A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause, And can say nothing. No, not for a king Upon whose property and most dear life A damn’d defeat was made. Am I a coward? Who calls me villain, breaks my pate across? Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face? Tweaks me by the nose, gives me the lie i’ th’ throat As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this? Ha! ’Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be But I am pigeon-liver’d, and lack gall To make oppression bitter, or ere this I should have fatted all the region kites With this slave’s offal. Bloody, bawdy villain! Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain! Oh vengeance! Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave, That I, the son of a dear father murder’d, Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell, Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words And fall a-cursing like a very drab, A scullion! Fie upon’t! Foh! About, my brain! I have heard That guilty creatures sitting at a play, Have by the very cunning of the scene, Been struck so to the soul that presently They have proclaim’d their malefactions. For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak With most miraculous organ. I’ll have these players Play something like the murder of my father Before mine uncle. I’ll observe his looks; I’ll tent him to the quick. If he but blench, I know my course. The spirit that I have seen May be the devil, and the devil hath power T’assume a pleasing shape, yea, and perhaps Out of my weakness and my melancholy, As he is very potent with such spirits, Abuses me to damn me. I’ll have grounds More relative than this. The play’s the thing Wherein I’ll catch the conscience of the King.  [_Exit._]
  ACT III  SCENE I. A room in the Castle.
  ACT IV  SCENE I. A room in the Castle.
Enter King, Queen, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.  KING. There’s matter in these sighs. These profound heaves You must translate; ’tis fit we understand them. Where is your son?  QUEEN. Bestow this place on us a little while.  [_To Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, who go out._]  Ah, my good lord, what have I seen tonight!  KING. What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?  QUEEN. Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit Behind the arras hearing something stir, Whips out his rapier, cries ‘A rat, a rat!’ And in this brainish apprehension kills The unseen good old man.  KING. O heavy deed! It had been so with us, had we been there. His liberty is full of threats to all; To you yourself, to us, to everyone. Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer’d? It will be laid to us, whose providence Should have kept short, restrain’d, and out of haunt This mad young man. But so much was our love We would not understand what was most fit, But like the owner of a foul disease, To keep it from divulging, let it feed Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?  QUEEN. To draw apart the body he hath kill’d, O’er whom his very madness, like some ore Among a mineral of metals base, Shows itself pure. He weeps for what is done.  KING. O Gertrude, come away! The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch But we will ship him hence, and this vile deed We must with all our majesty and skill Both countenance and excuse.—Ho, Guildenstern!  Re-enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.  Friends both, go join you with some further aid: Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain, And from his mother’s closet hath he dragg’d him. Go seek him out, speak fair, and bring the body Into the chapel. I pray you haste in this.  [_Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern._]  Come, Gertrude, we’ll call up our wisest friends, And let them know both what we mean to do And what’s untimely done, so haply slander, Whose whisper o’er the world’s diameter, As level as the cannon to his blank, Transports his poison’d shot, may miss our name, And hit the woundless air. O, come away! My soul is full of discord and dismay.  [_Exeunt._]   SCENE II. Another room in the Castle.  Enter Hamlet.  HAMLET. Safely stowed.  ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN. [_Within._] Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!  HAMLET. What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they come.  Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.  ROSENCRANTZ. What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?  HAMLET. Compounded it with dust, whereto ’tis kin.  ROSENCRANTZ. Tell us where ’tis, that we may take it thence, And bear it to the chapel.  HAMLET. Do not believe it.  ROSENCRANTZ. Believe what?  HAMLET. That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides, to be demanded of a sponge—what replication should be made by the son of a king?  ROSENCRANTZ. Take you me for a sponge, my lord?  HAMLET. Ay, sir; that soaks up the King’s countenance, his rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the King best service in the end: he keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to be last swallowed: when he needs what you have gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you shall be dry again.  ROSENCRANTZ. I understand you not, my lord.  HAMLET. I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.  ROSENCRANTZ. My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us to the King.  HAMLET. The body is with the King, but the King is not with the body. The King is a thing—  GUILDENSTERN. A thing, my lord!  HAMLET. Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.  [_Exeunt._]   SCENE III. Another room in the Castle.  Enter King, attended.  KING. I have sent to seek him and to find the body. How dangerous is it that this man goes loose! Yet must not we put the strong law on him: He’s lov’d of the distracted multitude, Who like not in their judgement, but their eyes; And where ’tis so, th’offender’s scourge is weigh’d, But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even, This sudden sending him away must seem Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown By desperate appliance are reliev’d, Or not at all.  Enter Rosencrantz.  How now? What hath befall’n?  ROSENCRANTZ. Where the dead body is bestow’d, my lord, We cannot get from him.  KING. But where is he?  ROSENCRANTZ. Without, my lord, guarded, to know your pleasure.  KING. Bring him before us.  ROSENCRANTZ. Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.  Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern.  KING. Now, Hamlet, where’s Polonius?  HAMLET. At supper.  KING. At supper? Where?  HAMLET. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain convocation of politic worms are e’en at him. Your worm is your only emperor for diet. We fat all creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service,—two dishes, but to one table. That’s the end.  KING. Alas, alas!  HAMLET. A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm.  KING. What dost thou mean by this?  HAMLET. Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through the guts of a beggar.  KING. Where is Polonius?  HAMLET. In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him not there, seek him i’ th’other place yourself. But indeed, if you find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go up the stairs into the lobby.  KING. [_To some Attendants._] Go seek him there.  HAMLET. He will stay till you come.  [_Exeunt Attendants._]  KING. Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,— Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve For that which thou hast done,—must send thee hence With fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself; The bark is ready, and the wind at help, Th’associates tend, and everything is bent For England.  HAMLET. For England?  KING. Ay, Hamlet.  HAMLET. Good.  KING. So is it, if thou knew’st our purposes.  HAMLET. I see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for England! Farewell, dear mother.  KING. Thy loving father, Hamlet.  HAMLET. My mother. Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England.  [_Exit._]  KING. Follow him at foot. Tempt him with speed aboard; Delay it not; I’ll have him hence tonight. Away, for everything is seal’d and done That else leans on th’affair. Pray you make haste.  [_Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern._]  And England, if my love thou hold’st at aught,— As my great power thereof may give thee sense, Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red After the Danish sword, and thy free awe Pays homage to us,—thou mayst not coldly set Our sovereign process, which imports at full, By letters conjuring to that effect, The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England; For like the hectic in my blood he rages, And thou must cure me. Till I know ’tis done, Howe’er my haps, my joys were ne’er begun.  [_Exit._]   SCENE IV. A plain in Denmark.  Enter Fortinbras and Forces marching.  FORTINBRAS. Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king. Tell him that by his license, Fortinbras Craves the conveyance of a promis’d march Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous. If that his Majesty would aught with us, We shall express our duty in his eye; And let him know so.  CAPTAIN. I will do’t, my lord.  FORTINBRAS. Go softly on.  [_Exeunt all but the Captain._]  Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern &c.  HAMLET. Good sir, whose powers are these?  CAPTAIN. They are of Norway, sir.  HAMLET. How purpos’d, sir, I pray you?  CAPTAIN. Against some part of Poland.  HAMLET. Who commands them, sir?  CAPTAIN. The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.  HAMLET. Goes it against the main of Poland, sir, Or for some frontier?  CAPTAIN. Truly to speak, and with no addition, We go to gain a little patch of ground That hath in it no profit but the name. To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it; Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.  HAMLET. Why, then the Polack never will defend it.  CAPTAIN. Yes, it is already garrison’d.  HAMLET. Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats Will not debate the question of this straw! This is th’imposthume of much wealth and peace, That inward breaks, and shows no cause without Why the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.  CAPTAIN. God b’ wi’ you, sir.  [_Exit._]  ROSENCRANTZ. Will’t please you go, my lord?  HAMLET. I’ll be with you straight. Go a little before.  [_Exeunt all but Hamlet._]  How all occasions do inform against me, And spur my dull revenge. What is a man If his chief good and market of his time Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more. Sure he that made us with such large discourse, Looking before and after, gave us not That capability and godlike reason To fust in us unus’d. Now whether it be Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple Of thinking too precisely on th’event,— A thought which, quarter’d, hath but one part wisdom And ever three parts coward,—I do not know Why yet I live to say this thing’s to do, Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means To do’t. Examples gross as earth exhort me, Witness this army of such mass and charge, Led by a delicate and tender prince, Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff’d, Makes mouths at the invisible event, Exposing what is mortal and unsure To all that fortune, death, and danger dare, Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be great Is not to stir without great argument, But greatly to find quarrel in a straw When honour’s at the stake. How stand I then, That have a father kill’d, a mother stain’d, Excitements of my reason and my blood, And let all sleep, while to my shame I see The imminent death of twenty thousand men That, for a fantasy and trick of fame, Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause, Which is not tomb enough and continent To hide the slain? O, from this time forth, My thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth.  [_Exit._]   SCENE V. Elsinore. A room in the Castle.  Enter Queen, Horatio and a Gentleman.  QUEEN. I will not speak with her.  GENTLEMAN. She is importunate, indeed distract. Her mood will needs be pitied.  QUEEN. What would she have?  GENTLEMAN. She speaks much of her father; says she hears There’s tricks i’ th’ world, and hems, and beats her heart, Spurns enviously at straws, speaks things in doubt, That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing, Yet the unshaped use of it doth move The hearers to collection; they aim at it, And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts, Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures yield them, Indeed would make one think there might be thought, Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily. ’Twere good she were spoken with, for she may strew Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.  QUEEN. Let her come in.  [_Exit Gentleman._]  To my sick soul, as sin’s true nature is, Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss. So full of artless jealousy is guilt, It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.  Enter Ophelia.  OPHELIA. Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?  QUEEN. How now, Ophelia?  OPHELIA. [_Sings._]    How should I your true love know      From another one?    By his cockle hat and staff      And his sandal shoon.  QUEEN. Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?  OPHELIA. Say you? Nay, pray you mark. [_Sings._]    He is dead and gone, lady,      He is dead and gone,    At his head a grass green turf,      At his heels a stone.  QUEEN. Nay, but Ophelia—  OPHELIA. Pray you mark. [_Sings._]    White his shroud as the mountain snow.  Enter King.  QUEEN. Alas, look here, my lord!  OPHELIA. [_Sings._]      Larded all with sweet flowers;    Which bewept to the grave did not go      With true-love showers.  KING. How do you, pretty lady?  OPHELIA. Well, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker’s daughter. Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God be at your table!  KING. Conceit upon her father.  OPHELIA. Pray you, let’s have no words of this; but when they ask you what it means, say you this: [_Sings._]    Tomorrow is Saint Valentine’s day,      All in the morning betime,    And I a maid at your window,      To be your Valentine.     Then up he rose and donn’d his clothes,      And dupp’d the chamber door,    Let in the maid, that out a maid      Never departed more.  KING. Pretty Ophelia!  OPHELIA. Indeed la, without an oath, I’ll make an end on’t. [_Sings._]    By Gis and by Saint Charity,      Alack, and fie for shame!    Young men will do’t if they come to’t;      By Cock, they are to blame.     Quoth she, before you tumbled me,      You promis’d me to wed.    So would I ha’ done, by yonder sun,      An thou hadst not come to my bed.  KING. How long hath she been thus?  OPHELIA. I hope all will be well. We must be patient. But I cannot choose but weep, to think they would lay him i’ th’ cold ground. My brother shall know of it. And so I thank you for your good counsel. Come, my coach! Good night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies; good night, good night.  [_Exit._]  KING. Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.  [_Exit Horatio._]  O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs All from her father’s death. O Gertrude, Gertrude, When sorrows come, they come not single spies, But in battalions. First, her father slain; Next, your son gone; and he most violent author Of his own just remove; the people muddied, Thick, and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers For good Polonius’ death; and we have done but greenly In hugger-mugger to inter him. Poor Ophelia Divided from herself and her fair judgement, Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts. Last, and as much containing as all these, Her brother is in secret come from France, Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds, And wants not buzzers to infect his ear With pestilent speeches of his father’s death, Wherein necessity, of matter beggar’d, Will nothing stick our person to arraign In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this, Like to a murdering piece, in many places Gives me superfluous death.  [_A noise within._]  QUEEN. Alack, what noise is this?  KING. Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.  Enter a Gentleman.  What is the matter?  GENTLEMAN. Save yourself, my lord. The ocean, overpeering of his list, Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste Than young Laertes, in a riotous head, O’erbears your offices. The rabble call him lord, And, as the world were now but to begin, Antiquity forgot, custom not known, The ratifiers and props of every word, They cry ‘Choose we! Laertes shall be king!’ Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds, ‘Laertes shall be king, Laertes king.’  QUEEN. How cheerfully on the false trail they cry. O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs.  [_A noise within._]  KING. The doors are broke.  Enter Laertes, armed; Danes following.  LAERTES. Where is this king?—Sirs, stand you all without.  Danes. No, let’s come in.  LAERTES. I pray you, give me leave.  DANES. We will, we will.  [_They retire without the door._]  LAERTES. I thank you. Keep the door. O thou vile king, Give me my father.  QUEEN. Calmly, good Laertes.  LAERTES. That drop of blood that’s calm proclaims me bastard; Cries cuckold to my father, brands the harlot Even here between the chaste unsmirched brow Of my true mother.  KING. What is the cause, Laertes, That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?— Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person. There’s such divinity doth hedge a king, That treason can but peep to what it would, Acts little of his will.—Tell me, Laertes, Why thou art thus incens’d.—Let him go, Gertrude:— Speak, man.  LAERTES. Where is my father?  KING. Dead.  QUEEN. But not by him.  KING. Let him demand his fill.  LAERTES. How came he dead? I’ll not be juggled with. To hell, allegiance! Vows, to the blackest devil! Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit! I dare damnation. To this point I stand, That both the worlds, I give to negligence, Let come what comes; only I’ll be reveng’d Most throughly for my father.  KING. Who shall stay you?  LAERTES. My will, not all the world. And for my means, I’ll husband them so well, They shall go far with little.  KING. Good Laertes, If you desire to know the certainty Of your dear father’s death, is’t writ in your revenge That, sweepstake, you will draw both friend and foe, Winner and loser?  LAERTES. None but his enemies.  KING. Will you know them then?  LAERTES. To his good friends thus wide I’ll ope my arms; And, like the kind life-rendering pelican, Repast them with my blood.  KING. Why, now you speak Like a good child and a true gentleman. That I am guiltless of your father’s death, And am most sensibly in grief for it, It shall as level to your judgement ’pear As day does to your eye.  DANES. [_Within._] Let her come in.  LAERTES. How now! What noise is that?  Re-enter Ophelia, fantastically dressed with straws and flowers.  O heat, dry up my brains. Tears seven times salt, Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye. By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight, Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May! Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia! O heavens, is’t possible a young maid’s wits Should be as mortal as an old man’s life? Nature is fine in love, and where ’tis fine, It sends some precious instance of itself After the thing it loves.  OPHELIA. [_Sings._]    They bore him barefac’d on the bier,    Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny    And on his grave rain’d many a tear.—    Fare you well, my dove!  LAERTES. Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge, It could not move thus.  OPHELIA. You must sing ‘Down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.’ O, how the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward that stole his master’s daughter.  LAERTES. This nothing’s more than matter.  OPHELIA. There’s rosemary, that’s for remembrance; pray love, remember. And there is pansies, that’s for thoughts.  LAERTES. A document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted.  OPHELIA. There’s fennel for you, and columbines. There’s rue for you; and here’s some for me. We may call it herb of grace o’ Sundays. O you must wear your rue with a difference. There’s a daisy. I would give you some violets, but they wither’d all when my father died. They say he made a good end. [_Sings._]    For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.  LAERTES. Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself She turns to favour and to prettiness.  OPHELIA. [_Sings._]    And will he not come again?    And will he not come again?      No, no, he is dead,      Go to thy death-bed,    He never will come again.     His beard was as white as snow,    All flaxen was his poll.      He is gone, he is gone,      And we cast away moan.    God ha’ mercy on his soul.  And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b’ wi’ ye.  [_Exit._]  LAERTES. Do you see this, O God?  KING. Laertes, I must commune with your grief, Or you deny me right. Go but apart, Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will, And they shall hear and judge ’twixt you and me. If by direct or by collateral hand They find us touch’d, we will our kingdom give, Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours To you in satisfaction; but if not, Be you content to lend your patience to us, And we shall jointly labour with your soul To give it due content.  LAERTES. Let this be so; His means of death, his obscure burial,— No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o’er his bones, No noble rite, nor formal ostentation,— Cry to be heard, as ’twere from heaven to earth, That I must call’t in question.  KING. So you shall. And where th’offence is let the great axe fall. I pray you go with me.  [_Exeunt._]   SCENE VI. Another room in the Castle.  Enter Horatio and a Servant.  HORATIO. What are they that would speak with me?  SERVANT. Sailors, sir. They say they have letters for you.  HORATIO. Let them come in.  [_Exit Servant._]  I do not know from what part of the world I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.  Enter Sailors.  FIRST SAILOR. God bless you, sir.  HORATIO. Let him bless thee too.  FIRST SAILOR. He shall, sir, and’t please him. There’s a letter for you, sir. It comes from th’ambassador that was bound for England; if your name be Horatio, as I am let to know it is.  HORATIO. [_Reads._] ‘Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked this, give these fellows some means to the King. They have letters for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on a compelled valour, and in the grapple I boarded them. On the instant they got clear of our ship, so I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like thieves of mercy. But they knew what they did; I am to do a good turn for them. Let the King have the letters I have sent, and repair thou to me with as much haste as thou wouldst fly death. I have words to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will bring thee where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course for England: of them I have much to tell thee. Farewell.      He that thou knowest thine,      HAMLET.’  Come, I will give you way for these your letters, And do’t the speedier, that you may direct me To him from whom you brought them.  [_Exeunt._]   SCENE VII. Another room in the Castle.  Enter King and Laertes.  KING. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal, And you must put me in your heart for friend, Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear, That he which hath your noble father slain Pursu’d my life.  LAERTES. It well appears. But tell me Why you proceeded not against these feats, So crimeful and so capital in nature, As by your safety, wisdom, all things else, You mainly were stirr’d up.  KING. O, for two special reasons, Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew’d, But yet to me they are strong. The Queen his mother Lives almost by his looks; and for myself,— My virtue or my plague, be it either which,— She’s so conjunctive to my life and soul, That, as the star moves not but in his sphere, I could not but by her. The other motive, Why to a public count I might not go, Is the great love the general gender bear him, Who, dipping all his faults in their affection, Would like the spring that turneth wood to stone, Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows, Too slightly timber’d for so loud a wind, Would have reverted to my bow again, And not where I had aim’d them.  LAERTES. And so have I a noble father lost, A sister driven into desperate terms, Whose worth, if praises may go back again, Stood challenger on mount of all the age For her perfections. But my revenge will come.  KING. Break not your sleeps for that. You must not think That we are made of stuff so flat and dull That we can let our beard be shook with danger, And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more. I lov’d your father, and we love ourself, And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine—  Enter a Messenger.  How now? What news?  MESSENGER. Letters, my lord, from Hamlet. This to your Majesty; this to the Queen.  KING. From Hamlet! Who brought them?  MESSENGER. Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not. They were given me by Claudio. He receiv’d them Of him that brought them.  KING. Laertes, you shall hear them. Leave us.  [_Exit Messenger._]  [_Reads._] ‘High and mighty, you shall know I am set naked on your kingdom. Tomorrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes. When I shall, first asking your pardon thereunto, recount the occasions of my sudden and more strange return.      HAMLET.’  What should this mean? Are all the rest come back? Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?  LAERTES. Know you the hand?  KING. ’Tis Hamlet’s character. ‘Naked!’ And in a postscript here he says ‘alone.’ Can you advise me?  LAERTES. I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come, It warms the very sickness in my heart That I shall live and tell him to his teeth, ‘Thus diest thou.’  KING. If it be so, Laertes,— As how should it be so? How otherwise?— Will you be rul’d by me?  LAERTES. Ay, my lord; So you will not o’errule me to a peace.  KING. To thine own peace. If he be now return’d, As checking at his voyage, and that he means No more to undertake it, I will work him To an exploit, now ripe in my device, Under the which he shall not choose but fall; And for his death no wind shall breathe, But even his mother shall uncharge the practice And call it accident.  LAERTES. My lord, I will be rul’d; The rather if you could devise it so That I might be the organ.  KING. It falls right. You have been talk’d of since your travel much, And that in Hamlet’s hearing, for a quality Wherein they say you shine. Your sum of parts Did not together pluck such envy from him As did that one, and that, in my regard, Of the unworthiest siege.  LAERTES. What part is that, my lord?  KING. A very riband in the cap of youth, Yet needful too, for youth no less becomes The light and careless livery that it wears Than settled age his sables and his weeds, Importing health and graveness. Two months since Here was a gentleman of Normandy,— I’ve seen myself, and serv’d against, the French, And they can well on horseback, but this gallant Had witchcraft in’t. He grew unto his seat, And to such wondrous doing brought his horse, As had he been incorps’d and demi-natur’d With the brave beast. So far he topp’d my thought That I in forgery of shapes and tricks, Come short of what he did.  LAERTES. A Norman was’t?  KING. A Norman.  LAERTES. Upon my life, Lamord.  KING. The very same.  LAERTES. I know him well. He is the brooch indeed And gem of all the nation.  KING. He made confession of you, And gave you such a masterly report For art and exercise in your defence, And for your rapier most especially, That he cried out ’twould be a sight indeed If one could match you. The scrimers of their nation He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye, If you oppos’d them. Sir, this report of his Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy That he could nothing do but wish and beg Your sudden coming o’er to play with him. Now, out of this,—  LAERTES. What out of this, my lord?  KING. Laertes, was your father dear to you? Or are you like the painting of a sorrow, A face without a heart?  LAERTES. Why ask you this?  KING. Not that I think you did not love your father, But that I know love is begun by time, And that I see, in passages of proof, Time qualifies the spark and fire of it. There lives within the very flame of love A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it; And nothing is at a like goodness still, For goodness, growing to a pleurisy, Dies in his own too much. That we would do, We should do when we would; for this ‘would’ changes, And hath abatements and delays as many As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents; And then this ‘should’ is like a spendthrift sigh That hurts by easing. But to the quick o’ th’ulcer: Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake To show yourself your father’s son in deed, More than in words?  LAERTES. To cut his throat i’ th’ church.  KING. No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize; Revenge should have no bounds. But good Laertes, Will you do this, keep close within your chamber. Hamlet return’d shall know you are come home: We’ll put on those shall praise your excellence, And set a double varnish on the fame The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together And wager on your heads. He, being remiss, Most generous, and free from all contriving, Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease, Or with a little shuffling, you may choose A sword unbated, and in a pass of practice, Requite him for your father.  LAERTES. I will do’t. And for that purpose I’ll anoint my sword. I bought an unction of a mountebank So mortal that, but dip a knife in it, Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare, Collected from all simples that have virtue Under the moon, can save the thing from death This is but scratch’d withal. I’ll touch my point With this contagion, that if I gall him slightly, It may be death.  KING. Let’s further think of this, Weigh what convenience both of time and means May fit us to our shape. If this should fail, And that our drift look through our bad performance. ’Twere better not assay’d. Therefore this project Should have a back or second, that might hold If this did blast in proof. Soft, let me see. We’ll make a solemn wager on your cunnings,— I ha’t! When in your motion you are hot and dry, As make your bouts more violent to that end, And that he calls for drink, I’ll have prepar’d him A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping, If he by chance escape your venom’d stuck, Our purpose may hold there.  Enter Queen.  How now, sweet Queen?  QUEEN. One woe doth tread upon another’s heel, So fast they follow. Your sister’s drown’d, Laertes.  LAERTES. Drown’d! O, where?  QUEEN. There is a willow grows aslant a brook, That shows his hoary leaves in the glassy stream. There with fantastic garlands did she make Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples, That liberal shepherds give a grosser name, But our cold maids do dead men’s fingers call them. There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds Clamb’ring to hang, an envious sliver broke, When down her weedy trophies and herself Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide, And mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up, Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes, As one incapable of her own distress, Or like a creature native and indued Unto that element. But long it could not be Till that her garments, heavy with their drink, Pull’d the poor wretch from her melodious lay To muddy death.  LAERTES. Alas, then she is drown’d?  QUEEN. Drown’d, drown’d.  LAERTES. Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia, And therefore I forbid my tears. But yet It is our trick; nature her custom holds, Let shame say what it will. When these are gone, The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord, I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze, But that this folly douts it.  [_Exit._]  KING. Let’s follow, Gertrude; How much I had to do to calm his rage! Now fear I this will give it start again; Therefore let’s follow.  [_Exeunt._]
  ACT V  SCENE I. A churchyard.
Enter two Clowns with spades, &c.  FIRST CLOWN. Is she to be buried in Christian burial, when she wilfully seeks her own salvation?  SECOND CLOWN. I tell thee she is, and therefore make her grave straight. The crowner hath sat on her, and finds it Christian burial.  FIRST CLOWN. How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her own defence?  SECOND CLOWN. Why, ’tis found so.  FIRST CLOWN. It must be _se offendendo_, it cannot be else. For here lies the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act: and an act hath three branches. It is to act, to do, and to perform: argal, she drowned herself wittingly.  SECOND CLOWN. Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,—  FIRST CLOWN. Give me leave. Here lies the water; good. Here stands the man; good. If the man go to this water and drown himself, it is, will he nill he, he goes,—mark you that. But if the water come to him and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.  SECOND CLOWN. But is this law?  FIRST CLOWN. Ay, marry, is’t, crowner’s quest law.  SECOND CLOWN. Will you ha’ the truth on’t? If this had not been a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o’ Christian burial.  FIRST CLOWN. Why, there thou say’st. And the more pity that great folk should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves more than their even Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient gentlemen but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers: they hold up Adam’s profession.  SECOND CLOWN. Was he a gentleman?  FIRST CLOWN. He was the first that ever bore arms.  SECOND CLOWN. Why, he had none.  FIRST CLOWN. What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the Scripture? The Scripture says Adam digg’d. Could he dig without arms? I’ll put another question to thee. If thou answerest me not to the purpose, confess thyself—  SECOND CLOWN. Go to.  FIRST CLOWN. What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?  SECOND CLOWN. The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand tenants.  FIRST CLOWN. I like thy wit well in good faith, the gallows does well. But how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now, thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the church; argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To’t again, come.  SECOND CLOWN. Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a carpenter?  FIRST CLOWN. Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.  SECOND CLOWN. Marry, now I can tell.  FIRST CLOWN. To’t.  SECOND CLOWN. Mass, I cannot tell.  Enter Hamlet and Horatio, at a distance.  FIRST CLOWN. Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass will not mend his pace with beating; and when you are asked this question next, say ‘a grave-maker’. The houses he makes last till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of liquor.  [_Exit Second Clown._]  [_Digs and sings._]     In youth when I did love, did love,      Methought it was very sweet;    To contract, O, the time for, a, my behove,      O methought there was nothing meet.  HAMLET. Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at grave-making?  HORATIO. Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.  HAMLET. ’Tis e’en so; the hand of little employment hath the daintier sense.  FIRST CLOWN. [_Sings._]    But age with his stealing steps      Hath claw’d me in his clutch,    And hath shipp’d me into the land,      As if I had never been such.  [_Throws up a skull._]  HAMLET. That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How the knave jowls it to th’ ground, as if ’twere Cain’s jawbone, that did the first murder! This might be the pate of a politician which this ass now o’er-offices, one that would circumvent God, might it not?  HORATIO. It might, my lord.  HAMLET. Or of a courtier, which could say ‘Good morrow, sweet lord! How dost thou, good lord?’ This might be my lord such-a-one, that praised my lord such-a-one’s horse when he meant to beg it, might it not?  HORATIO. Ay, my lord.  HAMLET. Why, e’en so: and now my Lady Worm’s; chapless, and knocked about the mazard with a sexton’s spade. Here’s fine revolution, an we had the trick to see’t. Did these bones cost no more the breeding but to play at loggets with ’em? Mine ache to think on’t.  FIRST CLOWN. [_Sings._]    A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,      For and a shrouding-sheet;    O, a pit of clay for to be made      For such a guest is meet.  [_Throws up another skull._]  HAMLET. There’s another. Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer? Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? Why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of his action of battery? Hum. This fellow might be in’s time a great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries. Is this the fine of his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands will scarcely lie in this box; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?  HORATIO. Not a jot more, my lord.  HAMLET. Is not parchment made of sheep-skins?  HORATIO. Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too.  HAMLET. They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. I will speak to this fellow.—Whose grave’s this, sir?  FIRST CLOWN. Mine, sir. [_Sings._]    O, a pit of clay for to be made      For such a guest is meet.  HAMLET. I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in’t.  FIRST CLOWN. You lie out on’t, sir, and therefore ’tis not yours. For my part, I do not lie in’t, yet it is mine.  HAMLET. Thou dost lie in’t, to be in’t and say it is thine. ’Tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.  FIRST CLOWN. ’Tis a quick lie, sir; ’t will away again from me to you.  HAMLET. What man dost thou dig it for?  FIRST CLOWN. For no man, sir.  HAMLET. What woman then?  FIRST CLOWN. For none neither.  HAMLET. Who is to be buried in’t?  FIRST CLOWN. One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she’s dead.  HAMLET. How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, these three years I have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls his kibe.—How long hast thou been a grave-maker?  FIRST CLOWN. Of all the days i’ th’ year, I came to’t that day that our last King Hamlet o’ercame Fortinbras.  HAMLET. How long is that since?  FIRST CLOWN. Cannot you tell that? Every fool can tell that. It was the very day that young Hamlet was born,—he that is mad, and sent into England.  HAMLET. Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?  FIRST CLOWN. Why, because he was mad; he shall recover his wits there; or if he do not, it’s no great matter there.  HAMLET. Why?  FIRST CLOWN. ’Twill not be seen in him there; there the men are as mad as he.  HAMLET. How came he mad?  FIRST CLOWN. Very strangely, they say.  HAMLET. How strangely?  FIRST CLOWN. Faith, e’en with losing his wits.  HAMLET. Upon what ground?  FIRST CLOWN. Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and boy, thirty years.  HAMLET. How long will a man lie i’ th’earth ere he rot?  FIRST CLOWN. Faith, if he be not rotten before he die,—as we have many pocky corses nowadays that will scarce hold the laying in,—he will last you some eight year or nine year. A tanner will last you nine year.  HAMLET. Why he more than another?  FIRST CLOWN. Why, sir, his hide is so tann’d with his trade that he will keep out water a great while. And your water is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body. Here’s a skull now; this skull hath lain in the earth three-and-twenty years.  HAMLET. Whose was it?  FIRST CLOWN. A whoreson, mad fellow’s it was. Whose do you think it was?  HAMLET. Nay, I know not.  FIRST CLOWN. A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! A pour’d a flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick’s skull, the King’s jester.  HAMLET. This?  FIRST CLOWN. E’en that.  HAMLET. Let me see. [_Takes the skull._] Alas, poor Yorick. I knew him, Horatio, a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy. He hath borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how abhorred in my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung those lips that I have kiss’d I know not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment, that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock your own grinning? Quite chop-fallen? Now get you to my lady’s chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must come. Make her laugh at that.—Prithee, Horatio, tell me one thing.  HORATIO. What’s that, my lord?  HAMLET. Dost thou think Alexander looked o’ this fashion i’ th’earth?  HORATIO. E’en so.  HAMLET. And smelt so? Pah!  [_Throws down the skull._]  HORATIO. E’en so, my lord.  HAMLET. To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it stopping a bung-hole?  HORATIO. ’Twere to consider too curiously to consider so.  HAMLET. No, faith, not a jot. But to follow him thither with modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it; as thus. Alexander died, Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam whereto he was converted might they not stop a beer-barrel? Imperious Caesar, dead and turn’d to clay, Might stop a hole to keep the wind away. O, that that earth which kept the world in awe Should patch a wall t’expel the winter’s flaw. But soft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King.  Enter priests, &c, in procession; the corpse of Ophelia, Laertes and Mourners following; King, Queen, their Trains, &c.  The Queen, the courtiers. Who is that they follow? And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken The corse they follow did with desperate hand Fordo it own life. ’Twas of some estate. Couch we awhile and mark.  [_Retiring with Horatio._]  LAERTES. What ceremony else?  HAMLET. That is Laertes, a very noble youth. Mark.  LAERTES. What ceremony else?  PRIEST. Her obsequies have been as far enlarg’d As we have warranties. Her death was doubtful; And but that great command o’ersways the order, She should in ground unsanctified have lodg’d Till the last trumpet. For charitable prayers, Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her. Yet here she is allowed her virgin rites, Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home Of bell and burial.  LAERTES. Must there no more be done?  PRIEST. No more be done. We should profane the service of the dead To sing sage requiem and such rest to her As to peace-parted souls.  LAERTES. Lay her i’ th’earth, And from her fair and unpolluted flesh May violets spring. I tell thee, churlish priest, A minist’ring angel shall my sister be When thou liest howling.  HAMLET. What, the fair Ophelia?  QUEEN. [_Scattering flowers._] Sweets to the sweet. Farewell. I hop’d thou shouldst have been my Hamlet’s wife; I thought thy bride-bed to have deck’d, sweet maid, And not have strew’d thy grave.  LAERTES. O, treble woe Fall ten times treble on that cursed head Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense Depriv’d thee of. Hold off the earth a while, Till I have caught her once more in mine arms. [_Leaps into the grave._] Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead, Till of this flat a mountain you have made, To o’ertop old Pelion or the skyish head Of blue Olympus.  HAMLET. [_Advancing._] What is he whose grief Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow Conjures the wand’ring stars, and makes them stand Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I, Hamlet the Dane. [_Leaps into the grave._]  LAERTES. [_Grappling with him._] The devil take thy soul!  HAMLET. Thou pray’st not well. I prithee take thy fingers from my throat; For though I am not splenative and rash, Yet have I in me something dangerous, Which let thy wiseness fear. Away thy hand!  KING. Pluck them asunder.  QUEEN. Hamlet! Hamlet!  All. Gentlemen!  HORATIO. Good my lord, be quiet.  [_The Attendants part them, and they come out of the grave._]  HAMLET. Why, I will fight with him upon this theme Until my eyelids will no longer wag.  QUEEN. O my son, what theme?  HAMLET. I lov’d Ophelia; forty thousand brothers Could not, with all their quantity of love, Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?  KING. O, he is mad, Laertes.  QUEEN. For love of God forbear him!  HAMLET. ’Swounds, show me what thou’lt do: Woul’t weep? woul’t fight? woul’t fast? woul’t tear thyself? Woul’t drink up eisel? eat a crocodile? I’ll do’t. Dost thou come here to whine? To outface me with leaping in her grave? Be buried quick with her, and so will I. And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw Millions of acres on us, till our ground, Singeing his pate against the burning zone, Make Ossa like a wart. Nay, an thou’lt mouth, I’ll rant as well as thou.  QUEEN. This is mere madness: And thus awhile the fit will work on him; Anon, as patient as the female dove, When that her golden couplets are disclos’d, His silence will sit drooping.  HAMLET. Hear you, sir; What is the reason that you use me thus? I lov’d you ever. But it is no matter. Let Hercules himself do what he may, The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.  [_Exit._]  KING. I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.  [_Exit Horatio._]  [_To Laertes_] Strengthen your patience in our last night’s speech; We’ll put the matter to the present push.— Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son. This grave shall have a living monument. An hour of quiet shortly shall we see; Till then in patience our proceeding be.  [_Exeunt._]   SCENE II. A hall in the Castle.  Enter Hamlet and Horatio.  HAMLET. So much for this, sir. Now let me see the other; You do remember all the circumstance?  HORATIO. Remember it, my lord!  HAMLET. Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly, And prais’d be rashness for it,—let us know, Our indiscretion sometime serves us well, When our deep plots do pall; and that should teach us There’s a divinity that shapes our ends, Rough-hew them how we will.  HORATIO. That is most certain.  HAMLET. Up from my cabin, My sea-gown scarf’d about me, in the dark Grop’d I to find out them; had my desire, Finger’d their packet, and in fine, withdrew To mine own room again, making so bold, My fears forgetting manners, to unseal Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio, Oh royal knavery! an exact command, Larded with many several sorts of reasons, Importing Denmark’s health, and England’s too, With ho! such bugs and goblins in my life, That on the supervise, no leisure bated, No, not to stay the grinding of the axe, My head should be struck off.  HORATIO. Is’t possible?  HAMLET. Here’s the commission, read it at more leisure. But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?  HORATIO. I beseech you.  HAMLET. Being thus benetted round with villanies,— Or I could make a prologue to my brains, They had begun the play,—I sat me down, Devis’d a new commission, wrote it fair: I once did hold it, as our statists do, A baseness to write fair, and labour’d much How to forget that learning; but, sir, now It did me yeoman’s service. Wilt thou know The effect of what I wrote?  HORATIO. Ay, good my lord.  HAMLET. An earnest conjuration from the King, As England was his faithful tributary, As love between them like the palm might flourish, As peace should still her wheaten garland wear And stand a comma ’tween their amities, And many such-like ‘as’es of great charge, That on the view and know of these contents, Without debatement further, more or less, He should the bearers put to sudden death, Not shriving-time allow’d.  HORATIO. How was this seal’d?  HAMLET. Why, even in that was heaven ordinant. I had my father’s signet in my purse, Which was the model of that Danish seal: Folded the writ up in the form of the other, Subscrib’d it: gave’t th’impression; plac’d it safely, The changeling never known. Now, the next day Was our sea-fight, and what to this was sequent Thou know’st already.  HORATIO. So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to’t.  HAMLET. Why, man, they did make love to this employment. They are not near my conscience; their defeat Does by their own insinuation grow. ’Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes Between the pass and fell incensed points Of mighty opposites.  HORATIO. Why, what a king is this!  HAMLET. Does it not, thinks’t thee, stand me now upon,— He that hath kill’d my king, and whor’d my mother, Popp’d in between th’election and my hopes, Thrown out his angle for my proper life, And with such cozenage—is’t not perfect conscience To quit him with this arm? And is’t not to be damn’d To let this canker of our nature come In further evil?  HORATIO. It must be shortly known to him from England What is the issue of the business there.  HAMLET. It will be short. The interim is mine; And a man’s life’s no more than to say ‘One’. But I am very sorry, good Horatio, That to Laertes I forgot myself; For by the image of my cause I see The portraiture of his. I’ll court his favours. But sure the bravery of his grief did put me Into a tow’ring passion.  HORATIO. Peace, who comes here?  Enter Osric.  OSRIC. Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.  HAMLET. I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this waterfly?  HORATIO. No, my good lord.  HAMLET. Thy state is the more gracious; for ’tis a vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile; let a beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the king’s mess; ’tis a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.  OSRIC. Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart a thing to you from his Majesty.  HAMLET. I will receive it with all diligence of spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; ’tis for the head.  OSRIC. I thank your lordship, ’tis very hot.  HAMLET. No, believe me, ’tis very cold, the wind is northerly.  OSRIC. It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.  HAMLET. Methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.  OSRIC. Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,—as ’twere—I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his Majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the matter,—  HAMLET. I beseech you, remember,—  [_Hamlet moves him to put on his hat._]  OSRIC. Nay, in good faith; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and great showing. Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see.  HAMLET. Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you, though I know, to divide him inventorially would dizzy th’arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great article and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to make true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror and who else would trace him his umbrage, nothing more.  OSRIC. Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.  HAMLET. The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath?  OSRIC. Sir?  HORATIO. Is’t not possible to understand in another tongue? You will do’t, sir, really.  HAMLET. What imports the nomination of this gentleman?  OSRIC. Of Laertes?  HORATIO. His purse is empty already, all’s golden words are spent.  HAMLET. Of him, sir.  OSRIC. I know you are not ignorant,—  HAMLET. I would you did, sir; yet in faith if you did, it would not much approve me. Well, sir?  OSRIC. You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is,—  HAMLET. I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in excellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.  OSRIC. I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on him, by them in his meed he’s unfellowed.  HAMLET. What’s his weapon?  OSRIC. Rapier and dagger.  HAMLET. That’s two of his weapons. But well.  OSRIC. The King, sir, hath wager’d with him six Barbary horses, against the which he has imponed, as I take it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of very liberal conceit.  HAMLET. What call you the carriages?  HORATIO. I knew you must be edified by the margin ere you had done.  OSRIC. The carriages, sir, are the hangers.  HAMLET. The phrase would be more german to the matter if we could carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till then. But on. Six Barbary horses against six French swords, their assigns, and three liberal conceited carriages: that’s the French bet against the Danish. Why is this all imponed, as you call it?  OSRIC. The King, sir, hath laid that in a dozen passes between you and him, he shall not exceed you three hits. He hath laid on twelve for nine. And it would come to immediate trial if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.  HAMLET. How if I answer no?  OSRIC. I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.  HAMLET. Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his Majesty, it is the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the King hold his purpose, I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.  OSRIC. Shall I re-deliver you e’en so?  HAMLET. To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.  OSRIC. I commend my duty to your lordship.  HAMLET. Yours, yours.  [_Exit Osric._]  He does well to commend it himself, there are no tongues else for’s turn.  HORATIO. This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.  HAMLET. He did comply with his dug before he suck’d it. Thus has he,—and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes on,— only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of yeasty collection, which carries them through and through the most fanned and winnowed opinions; and do but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.  Enter a Lord.  LORD. My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in the hall. He sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes or that you will take longer time.  HAMLET. I am constant to my purposes, they follow the King’s pleasure. If his fitness speaks, mine is ready. Now or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.  LORD. The King and Queen and all are coming down.  HAMLET. In happy time.  LORD. The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.  HAMLET. She well instructs me.  [_Exit Lord._]  HORATIO. You will lose this wager, my lord.  HAMLET. I do not think so. Since he went into France, I have been in continual practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all’s here about my heart: but it is no matter.  HORATIO. Nay, good my lord.  HAMLET. It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving as would perhaps trouble a woman.  HORATIO. If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall their repair hither, and say you are not fit.  HAMLET. Not a whit, we defy augury. There’s a special providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, ’tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come. The readiness is all. Since no man has aught of what he leaves, what is’t to leave betimes?  Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Lords, Osric and Attendants with foils &c.  KING. Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.  [_The King puts Laertes’s hand into Hamlet’s._]  HAMLET. Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong; But pardon’t as you are a gentleman. This presence knows, and you must needs have heard, How I am punish’d with sore distraction. What I have done That might your nature, honour, and exception Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness. Was’t Hamlet wrong’d Laertes? Never Hamlet. If Hamlet from himself be ta’en away, And when he’s not himself does wrong Laertes, Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it. Who does it, then? His madness. If’t be so, Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong’d; His madness is poor Hamlet’s enemy. Sir, in this audience, Let my disclaiming from a purpos’d evil Free me so far in your most generous thoughts That I have shot my arrow o’er the house And hurt my brother.  LAERTES. I am satisfied in nature, Whose motive in this case should stir me most To my revenge. But in my terms of honour I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement Till by some elder masters of known honour I have a voice and precedent of peace To keep my name ungor’d. But till that time I do receive your offer’d love like love, And will not wrong it.  HAMLET. I embrace it freely, And will this brother’s wager frankly play.— Give us the foils; come on.  LAERTES. Come, one for me.  HAMLET. I’ll be your foil, Laertes; in mine ignorance Your skill shall like a star i’ th’ darkest night, Stick fiery off indeed.  LAERTES. You mock me, sir.  HAMLET. No, by this hand.  KING. Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet, You know the wager?  HAMLET. Very well, my lord. Your Grace has laid the odds o’ the weaker side.  KING. I do not fear it. I have seen you both; But since he is better’d, we have therefore odds.  LAERTES. This is too heavy. Let me see another.  HAMLET. This likes me well. These foils have all a length?  [_They prepare to play._]  OSRIC. Ay, my good lord.  KING. Set me the stoups of wine upon that table. If Hamlet give the first or second hit, Or quit in answer of the third exchange, Let all the battlements their ordnance fire; The King shall drink to Hamlet’s better breath, And in the cup an union shall he throw Richer than that which four successive kings In Denmark’s crown have worn. Give me the cups; And let the kettle to the trumpet speak, The trumpet to the cannoneer without, The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth, ‘Now the King drinks to Hamlet.’ Come, begin. And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.  HAMLET. Come on, sir.  LAERTES. Come, my lord.  [_They play._]  HAMLET. One.  LAERTES. No.  HAMLET. Judgement.  OSRIC. A hit, a very palpable hit.  LAERTES. Well; again.  KING. Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine; Here’s to thy health.  [_Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within._]  Give him the cup.  HAMLET. I’ll play this bout first; set it by awhile.  [_They play._]  Come. Another hit; what say you?  LAERTES. A touch, a touch, I do confess.  KING. Our son shall win.  QUEEN. He’s fat, and scant of breath. Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows. The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.  HAMLET. Good madam.  KING. Gertrude, do not drink.  QUEEN. I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.  KING. [_Aside._] It is the poison’d cup; it is too late.  HAMLET. I dare not drink yet, madam. By and by.  QUEEN. Come, let me wipe thy face.  LAERTES. My lord, I’ll hit him now.  KING. I do not think’t.  LAERTES. [_Aside._] And yet ’tis almost ’gainst my conscience.  HAMLET. Come for the third, Laertes. You do but dally. I pray you pass with your best violence. I am afeard you make a wanton of me.  LAERTES. Say you so? Come on.  [_They play._]  OSRIC. Nothing neither way.  LAERTES. Have at you now.  [_Laertes wounds Hamlet; then, in scuffling, they change rapiers, and Hamlet wounds Laertes._]  KING. Part them; they are incens’d.  HAMLET. Nay, come again!  [_The Queen falls._]  OSRIC. Look to the Queen there, ho!  HORATIO. They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?  OSRIC. How is’t, Laertes?  LAERTES. Why, as a woodcock to my own springe, Osric. I am justly kill’d with mine own treachery.  HAMLET. How does the Queen?  KING. She swoons to see them bleed.  QUEEN. No, no, the drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet! The drink, the drink! I am poison’d.  [_Dies._]  HAMLET. O villany! Ho! Let the door be lock’d: Treachery! Seek it out.  [_Laertes falls._]  LAERTES. It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain. No medicine in the world can do thee good. In thee there is not half an hour of life; The treacherous instrument is in thy hand, Unbated and envenom’d. The foul practice Hath turn’d itself on me. Lo, here I lie, Never to rise again. Thy mother’s poison’d. I can no more. The King, the King’s to blame.  HAMLET. The point envenom’d too! Then, venom, to thy work.  [_Stabs the King._]  OSRIC and LORDS. Treason! treason!  KING. O yet defend me, friends. I am but hurt.  HAMLET. Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane, Drink off this potion. Is thy union here? Follow my mother.  [_King dies._]  LAERTES. He is justly serv’d. It is a poison temper’d by himself. Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet. Mine and my father’s death come not upon thee, Nor thine on me.  [_Dies._]  HAMLET. Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee. I am dead, Horatio. Wretched Queen, adieu. You that look pale and tremble at this chance, That are but mutes or audience to this act, Had I but time,—as this fell sergeant, death, Is strict in his arrest,—O, I could tell you,— But let it be. Horatio, I am dead, Thou liv’st; report me and my cause aright To the unsatisfied.  HORATIO. Never believe it. I am more an antique Roman than a Dane. Here’s yet some liquor left.  HAMLET. As th’art a man, Give me the cup. Let go; by Heaven, I’ll have’t. O good Horatio, what a wounded name, Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me. If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart, Absent thee from felicity awhile, And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain, To tell my story.  [_March afar off, and shot within._]  What warlike noise is this?  OSRIC. Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland, To the ambassadors of England gives This warlike volley.  HAMLET. O, I die, Horatio. The potent poison quite o’er-crows my spirit: I cannot live to hear the news from England, But I do prophesy th’election lights On Fortinbras. He has my dying voice. So tell him, with the occurrents more and less, Which have solicited. The rest is silence.  [_Dies._]  HORATIO. Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince, And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest. Why does the drum come hither?  [_March within._]  Enter Fortinbras, the English Ambassadors and others.  FORTINBRAS. Where is this sight?  HORATIO. What is it you would see? If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.  FORTINBRAS. This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death, What feast is toward in thine eternal cell, That thou so many princes at a shot So bloodily hast struck?  FIRST AMBASSADOR. The sight is dismal; And our affairs from England come too late. The ears are senseless that should give us hearing, To tell him his commandment is fulfill’d, That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead. Where should we have our thanks?  HORATIO. Not from his mouth, Had it th’ability of life to thank you. He never gave commandment for their death. But since, so jump upon this bloody question, You from the Polack wars, and you from England Are here arriv’d, give order that these bodies High on a stage be placed to the view, And let me speak to th’ yet unknowing world How these things came about. So shall you hear Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts, Of accidental judgements, casual slaughters, Of deaths put on by cunning and forc’d cause, And, in this upshot, purposes mistook Fall’n on the inventors’ heads. All this can I Truly deliver.  FORTINBRAS. Let us haste to hear it, And call the noblest to the audience. For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune. I have some rights of memory in this kingdom, Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.  HORATIO. Of that I shall have also cause to speak, And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more. But let this same be presently perform’d, Even while men’s minds are wild, lest more mischance On plots and errors happen.  FORTINBRAS. Let four captains Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage, For he was likely, had he been put on, To have prov’d most royally; and for his passage, The soldiers’ music and the rites of war Speak loudly for him. Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss. Go, bid the soldiers shoot.  [_A dead march._]  [_Exeunt, bearing off the bodies, after which a peal of ordnance is shot off._]

  ACT I
SCENE I. London. A Room in the Palace.  Enter the King, Lord John of Lancaster, Earl of Westmoreland with others.  KING. So shaken as we are, so wan with care, Find we a time for frighted peace to pant, And breathe short-winded accents of new broils To be commenced in strands afar remote. No more the thirsty entrance of this soil Shall daub her lips with her own children’s blood, No more shall trenching war channel her fields, Nor bruise her flow’rets with the armed hoofs Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes, Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven, All of one nature, of one substance bred, Did lately meet in the intestine shock And furious close of civil butchery, Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks, March all one way, and be no more opposed Against acquaintance, kindred, and allies. The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife, No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends, As far as to the sepulchre of Christ— Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross We are impressed and engaged to fight— Forthwith a power of English shall we levy, Whose arms were molded in their mothers’ womb To chase these pagans in those holy fields Over whose acres walked those blessed feet Which fourteen hundred years ago were nailed For our advantage on the bitter cross. But this our purpose now is twelve month old, And bootless ’tis to tell you we will go; Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland, What yesternight our Council did decree In forwarding this dear expedience.  WESTMORELAND. My liege, this haste was hot in question, And many limits of the charge set down But yesternight, when all athwart there came A post from Wales loaden with heavy news, Whose worst was that the noble Mortimer, Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight Against the irregular and wild Glendower, Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken, A thousand of his people butchered, Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse, Such beastly shameless transformation, By those Welshwomen done, as may not be Without much shame retold or spoken of.  KING. It seems then that the tidings of this broil Brake off our business for the Holy Land.  WESTMORELAND. This, matched with other did, my gracious lord, For more uneven and unwelcome news Came from the North, and thus it did import: On Holy-rood day the gallant Hotspur there, Young Harry Percy, and brave Archibald, That ever-valiant and approved Scot, At Holmedon met, where they did spend A sad and bloody hour; As by discharge of their artillery, And shape of likelihood, the news was told; For he that brought them, in the very heat And pride of their contention did take horse, Uncertain of the issue any way.  KING. Here is a dear and true-industrious friend, Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse, Stained with the variation of each soil Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours; And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news. The Earl of Douglas is discomfited; Ten thousand bold Scots, two-and-twenty knights, Balked in their own blood, did Sir Walter see On Holmedon’s plains; of prisoners Hotspur took Mordake, Earl of Fife and eldest son To beaten Douglas, and the Earl of Athol, Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith. And is not this an honourable spoil, A gallant prize? Ha, cousin, is it not?  WESTMORELAND. In faith, it is a conquest for a prince to boast of.  KING. Yea, there thou mak’st me sad, and mak’st me sin In envy that my Lord Northumberland Should be the father to so blest a son, A son who is the theme of honour’s tongue, Amongst a grove the very straightest plant, Who is sweet Fortune’s minion and her pride; Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him, See riot and dishonour stain the brow Of my young Harry. O, that it could be proved That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged In cradle-clothes our children where they lay, And called mine Percy, his Plantagenet! Then would I have his Harry, and he mine: But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz, Of this young Percy’s pride? The prisoners, Which he in this adventure hath surprised To his own use he keeps, and sends me word I shall have none but Mordake, Earl of Fife.  WESTMORELAND. This is his uncle’s teaching, this is Worcester, Malevolent to you in all aspects, Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up The crest of youth against your dignity.  KING. But I have sent for him to answer this; And for this cause awhile we must neglect Our holy purpose to Jerusalem. Cousin, on Wednesday next our Council we Will hold at Windsor, so inform the lords: But come yourself with speed to us again, For more is to be said and to be done Than out of anger can be uttered.  WESTMORELAND. I will, my liege.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. The same. An Apartment of Prince Henry’s.  Enter Prince Henry and Sir John Falstaff.  FALSTAFF. Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?  PRINCE. Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack, and unbuttoning thee after supper, and sleeping upon benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know. What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the day? Unless hours were cups of sack, and minutes capons, and clocks the tongues of bawds, and dials the signs of leaping-houses, and the blessed sun himself a fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see no reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand the time of the day.  FALSTAFF. Indeed, you come near me now, Hal, for we that take purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not by Phœbus, he, that wand’ring knight so fair. And I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as God save thy Grace—Majesty I should say, for grace thou wilt have none—  PRINCE. What, none?  FALSTAFF. No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to be prologue to an egg and butter.  PRINCE. Well, how then? Come, roundly, roundly.  FALSTAFF. Marry then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not us that are squires of the night’s body be called thieves of the day’s beauty: let us be Diana’s foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the moon; and let men say we be men of good government, being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal.  PRINCE. Thou sayest well, and it holds well too, for the fortune of us that are the moon’s men doth ebb and flow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is, by the moon. As for proof now: a purse of gold most resolutely snatched on Monday night, and most dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning, got with swearing “Lay by” and spent with crying “Bring in”; now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder, and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.  FALSTAFF. By the Lord, thou say’st true, lad. And is not my hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?  PRINCE. As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. And is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?  FALSTAFF. How now, how now, mad wag? What, in thy quips and thy quiddities? What a plague have I to do with a buff jerkin?  PRINCE. Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?  FALSTAFF. Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many a time and oft.  PRINCE. Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?  FALSTAFF. No, I’ll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there.  PRINCE. Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch, and where it would not, I have used my credit.  FALSTAFF. Yea, and so used it that were it not here apparent that thou art heir apparent—But I prithee sweet wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when thou art king? And resolution thus fubbed as it is with the rusty curb of old father Antic the law? Do not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.  PRINCE. No, thou shalt.  FALSTAFF. Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I’ll be a brave judge.  PRINCE. Thou judgest false already, I mean thou shalt have the hanging of the thieves, and so become a rare hangman.  FALSTAFF. Well, Hal, well; and in some sort it jumps with my humour, as well as waiting in the court, I can tell you.  PRINCE. For obtaining of suits?  FALSTAFF. Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman hath no lean wardrobe. ’Sblood, I am as melancholy as a gib cat or a lugged bear.  PRINCE. Or an old lion, or a lover’s lute.  FALSTAFF. Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.  PRINCE. What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of Moor-ditch?  FALSTAFF. Thou hast the most unsavoury similes, and art indeed the most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young prince. But, Hal, I prithee trouble me no more with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a commodity of good names were to be bought. An old lord of the Council rated me the other day in the street about you, sir, but I marked him not, and yet he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not, and yet he talked wisely, and in the street too.  PRINCE. Thou didst well, for wisdom cries out in the streets and no man regards it.  FALSTAFF. O, thou hast damnable iteration, and art indeed able to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon me, Hal, God forgive thee for it. Before I knew thee, Hal, I knew nothing, and now am I, if a man should speak truly, little better than one of the wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give it over. By the Lord, an I do not, I am a villain. I’ll be damned for never a king’s son in Christendom.  PRINCE. Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?  FALSTAFF. Zounds, where thou wilt, lad, I’ll make one. An I do not, call me villain and baffle me.  PRINCE. I see a good amendment of life in thee, from praying to purse-taking.  FALSTAFF. Why, Hal, ’tis my vocation, Hal, ’tis no sin for a man to labour in his vocation.  Enter Poins.  Poins!—Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a match. O, if men were to be saved by merit, what hole in hell were hot enough for him? This is the most omnipotent villain that ever cried “Stand!” to a true man.  PRINCE. Good morrow, Ned.  POINS. Good morrow, sweet Hal.—What says Monsieur Remorse? What says Sir John Sack-and-sugar? Jack, how agrees the devil and thee about thy soul, that thou soldest him on Good Friday last for a cup of Madeira and a cold capon’s leg?  PRINCE. Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall have his bargain, for he was never yet a breaker of proverbs. He will give the devil his due.  POINS. Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil.  PRINCE. Else he had been damned for cozening the devil.  POINS. But, my lads, my lads, tomorrow morning, by four o’clock early at Gad’s Hill, there are pilgrims going to Canterbury with rich offerings, and traders riding to London with fat purses. I have visards for you all; you have horses for yourselves. Gadshill lies tonight in Rochester. I have bespoke supper tomorrow night in Eastcheap. We may do it as secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff your purses full of crowns. If you will not, tarry at home and be hanged.  FALSTAFF. Hear ye, Yedward, if I tarry at home and go not, I’ll hang you for going.  POINS. You will, chops?  FALSTAFF. Hal, wilt thou make one?  PRINCE. Who, I rob? I a thief? Not I, by my faith.  FALSTAFF. There’s neither honesty, manhood, nor good fellowship in thee, nor thou cam’st not of the blood royal, if thou darest not stand for ten shillings.  PRINCE. Well then, once in my days I’ll be a madcap.  FALSTAFF. Why, that’s well said.  PRINCE. Well, come what will, I’ll tarry at home.  FALSTAFF. By the Lord, I’ll be a traitor then, when thou art king.  PRINCE. I care not.  POINS. Sir John, I prithee, leave the Prince and me alone. I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure, that he shall go.  FALSTAFF. Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion, and him the ears of profiting, that what thou speakest may move, and what he hears may be believed, that the true prince may, for recreation sake, prove a false thief, for the poor abuses of the time want countenance. Farewell, you shall find me in Eastcheap.  PRINCE. Farewell, thou latter spring! Farewell, All-hallown summer!  [_Exit Falstaff._]  POINS. Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us tomorrow. I have a jest to execute that I cannot manage alone. Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto, and Gadshill shall rob those men that we have already waylaid. Yourself and I will not be there. And when they have the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cut this head off from my shoulders.  PRINCE. But how shall we part with them in setting forth?  POINS. Why, we will set forth before or after them, and appoint them a place of meeting, wherein it is at our pleasure to fail; and then will they adventure upon the exploit themselves, which they shall have no sooner achieved but we’ll set upon them.  PRINCE. Yea, but ’tis like that they will know us by our horses, by our habits, and by every other appointment, to be ourselves.  POINS. Tut, our horses they shall not see, I’ll tie them in the wood; our visards we will change after we leave them; and, sirrah, I have cases of buckram for the nonce, to immask our noted outward garments.  PRINCE. Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us.  POINS. Well, for two of them, I know them to be as true-bred cowards as ever turned back; and for the third, if he fight longer than he sees reason, I’ll forswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be the incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty at least he fought with, what wards, what blows, what extremities he endured; and in the reproof of this lives the jest.  PRINCE. Well, I’ll go with thee. Provide us all things necessary and meet me tomorrow night in Eastcheap; there I’ll sup. Farewell.  POINS. Farewell, my lord.  [_Exit._]  PRINCE. I know you all, and will awhile uphold The unyok’d humour of your idleness. Yet herein will I imitate the sun, Who doth permit the base contagious clouds To smother up his beauty from the world, That, when he please again to be himself, Being wanted, he may be more wonder’d at, By breaking through the foul and ugly mists Of vapours that did seem to strangle him. If all the year were playing holidays, To sport would be as tedious as to work; But, when they seldom come, they wish’d-for come, And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents. So when this loose behaviour I throw off, And pay the debt I never promised, By how much better than my word I am, By so much shall I falsify men’s hopes; And, like bright metal on a sullen ground, My reformation, glitt’ring o’er my fault, Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes Than that which hath no foil to set it off. I’ll so offend, to make offence a skill, Redeeming time, when men think least I will.  [_Exit._]  SCENE III. The Same. A Room in the Palace.  Enter King Henry, Northumberland, Worcester, Hotspur, Sir Walter Blunt and others.  KING. My blood hath been too cold and temperate, Unapt to stir at these indignities, And you have found me, for accordingly You tread upon my patience: but be sure I will from henceforth rather be myself, Mighty and to be fear’d, than my condition, Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down, And therefore lost that title of respect Which the proud soul ne’er pays but to the proud.  WORCESTER. Our house, my sovereign liege, little deserves The scourge of greatness to be used on it, And that same greatness too which our own hands Have holp to make so portly.  NORTHUMBERLAND. My lord,—  KING. Worcester, get thee gone, for I do see Danger and disobedience in thine eye: O, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory, And majesty might never yet endure The moody frontier of a servant brow. You have good leave to leave us. When we need Your use and counsel, we shall send for you.  [_Exit Worcester._]  [_To Northumberland._]  You were about to speak.  NORTHUMBERLAND. Yea, my good lord. Those prisoners in your Highness’ name demanded, Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took, Were, as he says, not with such strength denied As is deliver’d to your Majesty. Either envy, therefore, or misprision Is guilty of this fault, and not my son.  HOTSPUR. My liege, I did deny no prisoners. But I remember, when the fight was done, When I was dry with rage and extreme toil, Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword, Came there a certain lord, neat and trimly dress’d, Fresh as a bridegroom, and his chin new reap’d Show’d like a stubble-land at harvest-home. He was perfumed like a milliner, And ’twixt his finger and his thumb he held A pouncet-box, which ever and anon He gave his nose, and took’t away again, Who therewith angry, when it next came there, Took it in snuff; and still he smiled and talk’d. And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by, He call’d them untaught knaves, unmannerly, To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse Betwixt the wind and his nobility. With many holiday and lady terms He question’d me, amongst the rest demanded My prisoners in your Majesty’s behalf. I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold, Out of my grief and my impatience To be so pester’d with a popinjay, Answer’d neglectingly, I know not what, He should, or he should not; for he made me mad To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet, And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman Of guns and drums and wounds, God save the mark! And telling me the sovereignest thing on Earth Was parmacety for an inward bruise, And that it was great pity, so it was, This villainous saltpetre should be digg’d Out of the bowels of the harmless earth, Which many a good tall fellow had destroy’d So cowardly, and but for these vile guns, He would himself have been a soldier. This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord, I answered indirectly, as I said, And I beseech you, let not his report Come current for an accusation Betwixt my love and your high Majesty.  BLUNT. The circumstance consider’d, good my lord, Whatever Harry Percy then had said To such a person, and in such a place, At such a time, with all the rest retold, May reasonably die, and never rise To do him wrong, or any way impeach What then he said, so he unsay it now.  KING. Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners, But with proviso and exception, That we at our own charge shall ransom straight His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer, Who, on my soul, hath wilfully betray’d The lives of those that he did lead to fight Against that great magician, damn’d Glendower, Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March Hath lately married. Shall our coffers then Be emptied to redeem a traitor home? Shall we buy treason and indent with fears When they have lost and forfeited themselves? No, on the barren mountains let him starve; For I shall never hold that man my friend Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost To ransom home revolted Mortimer.  HOTSPUR. Revolted Mortimer! He never did fall off, my sovereign liege, But by the chance of war. To prove that true Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds, Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took, When on the gentle Severn’s sedgy bank, In single opposition hand to hand, He did confound the best part of an hour In changing hardiment with great Glendower. Three times they breathed, and three times did they drink, Upon agreement, of swift Severn’s flood, Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks, Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds, And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank Blood-stained with these valiant combatants. Never did bare and rotten policy Colour her working with such deadly wounds, Nor never could the noble Mortimer Receive so many, and all willingly. Then let not him be slander’d with revolt.  KING. Thou dost belie him, Percy, thou dost belie him, He never did encounter with Glendower. I tell thee, he durst as well have met the devil alone As Owen Glendower for an enemy. Art not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer. Send me your prisoners with the speediest means, Or you shall hear in such a kind from me As will displease you.—My Lord Northumberland, We license your departure with your son.— Send us your prisoners, or you’ll hear of it.  [_Exit King Henry, Blunt and train._]  HOTSPUR. An if the devil come and roar for them, I will not send them. I will after straight And tell him so, for I will ease my heart, Albeit I make a hazard of my head.  NORTHUMBERLAND. What, drunk with choler? Stay, and pause awhile. Here comes your uncle.  Enter Worcester.  HOTSPUR. Speak of Mortimer? Zounds, I will speak of him, and let my soul Want mercy if I do not join with him. Yea, on his part I’ll empty all these veins, And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust, But I will lift the down-trod Mortimer As high in the air as this unthankful King, As this ingrate and canker’d Bolingbroke.  NORTHUMBERLAND. [_To Worcester._] Brother, the King hath made your nephew mad.  WORCESTER. Who struck this heat up after I was gone?  HOTSPUR. He will forsooth have all my prisoners, And when I urged the ransom once again Of my wife’s brother, then his cheek look’d pale, And on my face he turn’d an eye of death, Trembling even at the name of Mortimer.  WORCESTER. I cannot blame him. Was not he proclaim’d By Richard that dead is, the next of blood?  NORTHUMBERLAND. He was; I heard the proclamation. And then it was when the unhappy King— Whose wrongs in us God pardon!—did set forth Upon his Irish expedition; From whence he, intercepted, did return To be deposed, and shortly murdered.  WORCESTER. And for whose death we in the world’s wide mouth Live scandalized and foully spoken of.  HOTSPUR. But soft, I pray you, did King Richard then Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer Heir to the crown?  NORTHUMBERLAND. He did; myself did hear it.  HOTSPUR. Nay, then I cannot blame his cousin King, That wish’d him on the barren mountains starve. But shall it be that you that set the crown Upon the head of this forgetful man, And for his sake wear the detested blot Of murderous subornation—shall it be, That you a world of curses undergo, Being the agents, or base second means, The cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather? O, pardon me, that I descend so low, To show the line and the predicament Wherein you range under this subtle King. Shall it for shame be spoken in these days, Or fill up chronicles in time to come, That men of your nobility and power Did gage them both in an unjust behalf (As both of you, God pardon it, have done) To put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose, And plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke? And shall it in more shame be further spoken, That you are fool’d, discarded, and shook off By him for whom these shames ye underwent? No, yet time serves wherein you may redeem Your banish’d honours, and restore yourselves Into the good thoughts of the world again: Revenge the jeering and disdain’d contempt Of this proud King, who studies day and night To answer all the debt he owes to you Even with the bloody payment of your deaths. Therefore, I say—  WORCESTER. Peace, cousin, say no more. And now I will unclasp a secret book, And to your quick-conceiving discontents I’ll read you matter deep and dangerous, As full of peril and adventurous spirit As to o’er-walk a current roaring loud On the unsteadfast footing of a spear.  HOTSPUR. If we fall in, good night, or sink or swim! Send danger from the east unto the west, So honour cross it from the north to south, And let them grapple. O, the blood more stirs To rouse a lion than to start a hare!  NORTHUMBERLAND. Imagination of some great exploit Drives him beyond the bounds of patience.  HOTSPUR. By Heaven, methinks it were an easy leap To pluck bright honour from the pale-faced moon, Or dive into the bottom of the deep, Where fathom-line could never touch the ground, And pluck up drowned honour by the locks, So he that doth redeem her thence might wear Without corrival all her dignities. But out upon this half-faced fellowship!  WORCESTER. He apprehends a world of figures here, But not the form of what he should attend.— Good cousin, give me audience for a while.  HOTSPUR. I cry you mercy.  WORCESTER. Those same noble Scots That are your prisoners—  HOTSPUR. I’ll keep them all; By God, he shall not have a Scot of them, No, if a Scot would save his soul, he shall not. I’ll keep them, by this hand!  WORCESTER. You start away, And lend no ear unto my purposes: Those prisoners you shall keep—  HOTSPUR. Nay, I will: that’s flat. He said he would not ransom Mortimer, Forbade my tongue to speak of Mortimer, But I will find him when he lies asleep, And in his ear I’ll holla “Mortimer!” Nay, I’ll have a starling shall be taught to speak Nothing but “Mortimer”, and give it him, To keep his anger still in motion.  WORCESTER. Hear you, cousin, a word.  HOTSPUR. All studies here I solemnly defy, Save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke: And that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales, But that I think his father loves him not, And would be glad he met with some mischance— I would have him poison’d with a pot of ale.  WORCESTER. Farewell, kinsman. I will talk to you When you are better temper’d to attend.  NORTHUMBERLAND. Why, what a wasp-stung and impatient fool Art thou to break into this woman’s mood, Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own!  HOTSPUR. Why, look you, I am whipp’d and scourged with rods, Nettled, and stung with pismires, when I hear Of this vile politician, Bolingbroke. In Richard’s time—what do you call the place? A plague upon’t! It is in Gloucestershire. ’Twas where the madcap Duke his uncle kept, His uncle York, where I first bow’d my knee Unto this king of smiles, this Bolingbroke, ’Sblood, when you and he came back from Ravenspurgh.  NORTHUMBERLAND. At Berkeley castle.  HOTSPUR. You say true. Why, what a candy deal of courtesy This fawning greyhound then did proffer me! “Look, when his infant fortune came to age,” And, “Gentle Harry Percy,” and “kind cousin.” O, the devil take such cozeners!—God forgive me! Good uncle, tell your tale. I have done.  WORCESTER. Nay, if you have not, to it again, We will stay your leisure.  HOTSPUR. I have done, i’faith.  WORCESTER. Then once more to your Scottish prisoners; Deliver them up without their ransom straight, And make the Douglas’ son your only mean For powers in Scotland, which, for divers reasons Which I shall send you written, be assured Will easily be granted.—[_To Northumberland._] You, my lord, Your son in Scotland being thus employ’d, Shall secretly into the bosom creep Of that same noble prelate well beloved, The Archbishop.  HOTSPUR. Of York, is it not?  WORCESTER. True, who bears hard His brother’s death at Bristol, the Lord Scroop. I speak not this in estimation, As what I think might be, but what I know Is ruminated, plotted, and set down, And only stays but to behold the face Of that occasion that shall bring it on.  HOTSPUR. I smell it. Upon my life it will do well.  NORTHUMBERLAND. Before the game is afoot thou still let’st slip.  HOTSPUR. Why, it cannot choose but be a noble plot; And then the power of Scotland and of York To join with Mortimer, ha?  WORCESTER. And so they shall.  HOTSPUR. In faith, it is exceedingly well aim’d.  WORCESTER. And ’tis no little reason bids us speed, To save our heads by raising of a head; For, bear ourselves as even as we can, The King will always think him in our debt, And think we think ourselves unsatisfied, Till he hath found a time to pay us home: And see already how he doth begin To make us strangers to his looks of love.  HOTSPUR. He does, he does, we’ll be revenged on him.  WORCESTER. Cousin, farewell. No further go in this Than I by letters shall direct your course. When time is ripe, which will be suddenly, I’ll steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer, Where you and Douglas, and our powers at once, As I will fashion it, shall happily meet, To bear our fortunes in our own strong arms, Which now we hold at much uncertainty.  NORTHUMBERLAND. Farewell, good brother; we shall thrive, I trust.  HOTSPUR. Uncle, adieu. O, let the hours be short, Till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport!  [_Exeunt._]
  ACT II
SCENE I. Rochester. An Inn-Yard.  Enter a Carrier with a lantern in his hand.  FIRST CARRIER. Heigh-ho! an it be not four by the day, I’ll be hang’d. Charles’ wain is over the new chimney, and yet our horse not pack’d.—What, ostler!  OSTLER. [_within._] Anon, anon.  FIRST CARRIER. I prithee, Tom, beat Cut’s saddle, put a few flocks in the point; poor jade is wrung in the withers out of all cess.  Enter another Carrier.  SECOND CARRIER. Peas and beans are as dank here as a dog, and that is the next way to give poor jades the bots. This house is turned upside down since Robin ostler died.  FIRST CARRIER. Poor fellow never joyed since the price of oats rose, it was the death of him.  SECOND CARRIER. I think this be the most villainous house in all London road for fleas. I am stung like a tench.  FIRST CARRIER. Like a tench! By the Mass, there is ne’er a king christen could be better bit than I have been since the first cock.  SECOND CARRIER. Why, they will allow us ne’er a jordan, and then we leak in your chimney, and your chamber-lye breeds fleas like a loach.  FIRST CARRIER. What, ostler! Come away and be hanged, come away.  SECOND CARRIER. I have a gammon of bacon and two razes of ginger, to be delivered as far as Charing Cross.  FIRST CARRIER. God’s body! The turkeys in my pannier are quite starved.—What, ostler! A plague on thee! Hast thou never an eye in thy head? Canst not hear? An ’twere not as good deed as drink to break the pate on thee, I am a very villain. Come, and be hanged. Hast no faith in thee?  Enter Gadshill.  GADSHILL. Good morrow, carriers. What’s o’clock?  FIRST CARRIER. I think it be two o’clock.  GADSHILL. I prithee, lend me thy lantern, to see my gelding in the stable.  FIRST CARRIER. Nay, by God, soft! I know a trick worth two of that, i’faith.  GADSHILL. I pray thee, lend me thine.  SECOND CARRIER. Ay, when? Canst tell? “Lend me thy lantern,” quoth he! Marry, I’ll see thee hanged first.  GADSHILL. Sirrah carrier, what time do you mean to come to London?  SECOND CARRIER. Time enough to go to bed with a candle, I warrant thee. Come, neighbour Mugs, we’ll call up the gentlemen. They will along with company, for they have great charge.  [_Exeunt Carriers._]  GADSHILL. What, ho! Chamberlain!  Enter Chamberlain.  CHAMBERLAIN. At hand, quoth pick-purse.  GADSHILL. That’s even as fair as “at hand, quoth the chamberlain,” for thou variest no more from picking of purses than giving direction doth from labouring; thou layest the plot how.  CHAMBERLAIN. Good morrow, Master Gadshill. It holds current that I told you yesternight: there’s a franklin in the Wild of Kent hath brought three hundred marks with him in gold. I heard him tell it to one of his company last night at supper; a kind of auditor, one that hath abundance of charge too, God knows what. They are up already, and call for eggs and butter. They will away presently.  GADSHILL. Sirrah, if they meet not with Saint Nicholas’ clerks, I’ll give thee this neck.  CHAMBERLAIN. No, I’ll none of it. I pray thee, keep that for the hangman, for I know thou worshippest Saint Nicholas as truly as a man of falsehood may.  GADSHILL. What talkest thou to me of the hangman? If I hang, I’ll make a fat pair of gallows; for, if I hang, old Sir John hangs with me, and thou knowest he is no starveling. Tut, there are other Troyans that thou dream’st not of, the which for sport sake are content to do the profession some grace, that would, if matters should be looked into, for their own credit sake make all whole. I am joined with no foot-land-rakers, no long-staff sixpenny strikers, none of these mad mustachio purple-hued malt-worms, but with nobility and tranquillity, burgomasters and great oneyers, such as can hold in, such as will strike sooner than speak, and speak sooner than drink, and drink sooner than pray: and yet, zounds, I lie, for they pray continually to their saint the commonwealth, or rather not pray to her, but prey on her, for they ride up and down on her, and make her their boots.  CHAMBERLAIN. What, the commonwealth their boots? Will she hold out water in foul way?  GADSHILL. She will, she will; justice hath liquored her. We steal as in a castle, cock-sure; we have the receipt of fern-seed, we walk invisible.  CHAMBERLAIN. Nay, by my faith, I think you are more beholding to the night than to fern-seed for your walking invisible.  GADSHILL. Give me thy hand. Thou shalt have a share in our purchase, as I am a true man.  CHAMBERLAIN. Nay, rather let me have it, as you are a false thief.  GADSHILL. Go to; _homo_ is a common name to all men. Bid the ostler bring my gelding out of the stable. Farewell, you muddy knave.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. The Road by Gads-hill.  Enter Prince Henry and Poins; Bardolph and Peto at some distance.  POINS. Come, shelter, shelter! I have removed Falstaff’s horse, and he frets like a gummed velvet.  PRINCE. Stand close.  [_They retire._]  Enter Falstaff.  FALSTAFF. Poins! Poins, and be hanged! Poins!  PRINCE. [_Coming forward._] Peace, ye fat-kidneyed rascal! What a brawling dost thou keep!  FALSTAFF. Where’s Poins, Hal?  PRINCE. He is walked up to the top of the hill. I’ll go seek him.  [_Retires._]  FALSTAFF. I am accursed to rob in that thief’s company. The rascal hath removed my horse and tied him I know not where. If I travel but four foot by the square further afoot, I shall break my wind. Well, I doubt not but to die a fair death for all this, if I ’scape hanging for killing that rogue. I have forsworn his company hourly any time this two-and-twenty years, and yet I am bewitched with the rogue’s company. If the rascal have not given me medicines to make me love him, I’ll be hanged. It could not be else: I have drunk medicines. Poins! Hal! A plague upon you both! Bardolph! Peto! I’ll starve ere I’ll rob a foot further. An ’twere not as good a deed as drink, to turn true man, and to leave these rogues, I am the veriest varlet that ever chewed with a tooth. Eight yards of uneven ground is threescore and ten miles afoot with me, and the stony-hearted villains know it well enough. A plague upon it when thieves cannot be true one to another! [_They whistle._] Whew! A plague upon you all! Give me my horse, you rogues, give me my horse and be hanged!  PRINCE. [_Coming forward._] Peace, you fat guts, lie down, lay thine ear close to the ground, and list if thou canst hear the tread of travellers.  FALSTAFF. Have you any levers to lift me up again, being down? ’Sblood, I’ll not bear my own flesh so far afoot again for all the coin in thy father’s exchequer. What a plague mean ye to colt me thus?  PRINCE. Thou liest, thou art not colted, thou art uncolted.  FALSTAFF. I prithee, good Prince Hal, help me to my horse, good king’s son.  PRINCE. Out, ye rogue! Shall I be your ostler?  FALSTAFF. Hang thyself in thine own heir-apparent garters! If I be ta’en, I’ll peach for this. An I have not ballads made on you all, and sung to filthy tunes, let a cup of sack be my poison—when a jest is so forward, and afoot too! I hate it.  Enter Gadshill.  GADSHILL. Stand!  FALSTAFF. So I do, against my will.  POINS. O, ’tis our setter. I know his voice.  Comes forward with Bardolph and Peto.  BARDOLPH. What news?  GADSHILL. Case ye, case ye, on with your visards. There’s money of the King’s coming down the hill, ’tis going to the King’s exchequer.  FALSTAFF. You lie, ye rogue, ’tis going to the King’s tavern.  GADSHILL. There’s enough to make us all.  FALSTAFF. To be hanged.  PRINCE. Sirs, you four shall front them in the narrow lane. Ned Poins and I will walk lower; if they ’scape from your encounter, then they light on us.  PETO. How many be there of them?  GADSHILL. Some eight or ten.  FALSTAFF. Zounds, will they not rob us?  PRINCE. What, a coward, Sir John Paunch?  FALSTAFF. Indeed, I am not John of Gaunt, your grandfather, but yet no coward, Hal.  PRINCE. Well, we leave that to the proof.  POINS. Sirrah Jack, thy horse stands behind the hedge. When thou need’st him, there thou shalt find him. Farewell, and stand fast.  FALSTAFF. Now cannot I strike him, if I should be hanged.  PRINCE. [_aside to Poins._] Ned, where are our disguises?  POINS. [_aside to Prince Henry._] Here, hard by. Stand close.  [_Exeunt Prince and Poins._]  FALSTAFF. Now, my masters, happy man be his dole, say I. Every man to his business.  Enter the Travellers.  FIRST TRAVELLER. Come, neighbour, the boy shall lead our horses down the hill; we’ll walk afoot awhile and ease our legs.  THIEVES. Stand!  SECOND TRAVELLER. Jesu bless us!  FALSTAFF. Strike, down with them, cut the villains’ throats! Ah, whoreson caterpillars, bacon-fed knaves, they hate us youth. Down with them, fleece them!  FIRST TRAVELLER. O, we are undone, both we and ours for ever!  FALSTAFF. Hang ye, gorbellied knaves, are ye undone? No, ye fat chuffs, I would your store were here! On, bacons, on! What, ye knaves! young men must live. You are grandjurors, are ye? We’ll jure ye, faith.  [_Here they rob them and bind them. Exeunt_]  Enter Prince Henry and Poins in buckram suits.  PRINCE. The thieves have bound the true men. Now could thou and I rob the thieves, and go merrily to London, it would be argument for a week, laughter for a month, and a good jest for ever.  POINS. Stand close, I hear them coming.  [_They retire._]  Enter the Thieves again.  FALSTAFF. Come, my masters, let us share, and then to horse before day. An the Prince and Poins be not two arrant cowards, there’s no equity stirring. There’s no more valour in that Poins than in a wild duck.  [_As they are sharing, the Prince and Poins set upon them._]  PRINCE. Your money!  POINS. Villains!  [_Falstaff after a blow or two, and the others run away, leaving the booty behind them._]  PRINCE. Got with much ease. Now merrily to horse. The thieves are all scatter’d, and possess’d with fear So strongly that they dare not meet each other; Each takes his fellow for an officer. Away, good Ned. Falstaff sweats to death, And lards the lean earth as he walks along. Were’t not for laughing, I should pity him.  POINS. How the fat rogue roared!  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. Warkworth. A Room in the Castle.  Enter Hotspur, reading a letter.  HOTSPUR. “But, for mine own part, my lord, I could be well contented to be there, in respect of the love I bear your house.” He could be contented; why is he not, then? In respect of the love he bears our house—he shows in this, he loves his own barn better than he loves our house. Let me see some more. “The purpose you undertake is dangerous”—Why, that’s certain. ’Tis dangerous to take a cold, to sleep, to drink; but I tell you, my lord fool, out of this nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety. “The purpose you undertake is dangerous, the friends you have named uncertain, the time itself unsorted, and your whole plot too light for the counterpoise of so great an opposition.” Say you so, say you so? I say unto you again, you are a shallow, cowardly hind, and you lie. What a lack-brain is this! By the Lord, our plot is a good plot as ever was laid, our friends true and constant: a good plot, good friends, and full of expectation; an excellent plot, very good friends. What a frosty-spirited rogue is this! Why, my Lord of York commends the plot and the general course of the action. Zounds, an I were now by this rascal, I could brain him with his lady’s fan. Is there not my father, my uncle, and myself? Lord Edmund Mortimer, my Lord of York, and Owen Glendower? Is there not besides the Douglas? Have I not all their letters to meet me in arms by the ninth of the next month, and are they not some of them set forward already? What a pagan rascal is this, an infidel! Ha! You shall see now, in very sincerity of fear and cold heart, will he to the King, and lay open all our proceedings. O, I could divide myself, and go to buffets, for moving such a dish of skim milk with so honourable an action! Hang him, let him tell the King, we are prepared. I will set forward tonight.—  Enter Lady Percy.  How now, Kate! I must leave you within these two hours.  LADY PERCY. O my good lord, why are you thus alone? For what offence have I this fortnight been A banish’d woman from my Harry’s bed? Tell me, sweet lord, what is’t that takes from thee Thy stomach, pleasure, and thy golden sleep? Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth, And start so often when thou sit’st alone? Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks, And given my treasures and my rights of thee To thick-eyed musing and curst melancholy? In thy faint slumbers I by thee have watch’d, And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars, Speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed, Cry “Courage! To the field!” And thou hast talk’d Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tents, Of palisadoes, frontiers, parapets, Of basilisks, of cannon, culverin, Of prisoners’ ransom, and of soldiers slain, And all the currents of a heady fight. Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war, And thus hath so bestirr’d thee in thy sleep, That beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow Like bubbles in a late-disturbed stream, And in thy face strange motions have appear’d, Such as we see when men restrain their breath On some great sudden hest. O, what portents are these? Some heavy business hath my lord in hand, And I must know it, else he loves me not.  HOTSPUR. What, ho!  Enter a Servant.  Is Gilliams with the packet gone?  SERVANT. He is, my lord, an hour ago.  HOTSPUR. Hath Butler brought those horses from the sheriff?  SERVANT. One horse, my lord, he brought even now.  HOTSPUR. What horse? A roan, a crop-ear, is it not?  SERVANT. It is, my lord.  HOTSPUR. That roan shall be my throne. Well, I will back him straight. O Esperance! Bid Butler lead him forth into the park.  [_Exit Servant._]  LADY PERCY. But hear you, my lord.  HOTSPUR. What say’st thou, my lady?  LADY PERCY. What is it carries you away?  HOTSPUR. Why, my horse, my love, my horse.  LADY PERCY. Out, you mad-headed ape! A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen As you are toss’d with. In faith, I’ll know your business, Harry, that I will. I fear my brother Mortimer doth stir About his title, and hath sent for you To line his enterprise. But if you go—  HOTSPUR. So far afoot, I shall be weary, love.  LADY PERCY. Come, come, you paraquito, answer me Directly unto this question that I ask. In faith, I’ll break thy little finger, Harry, If thou wilt not tell me all things true.  HOTSPUR. Away, Away, you trifler! Love, I love thee not, I care not for thee, Kate. This is no world To play with mammets and to tilt with lips. We must have bloody noses and crack’d crowns, And pass them current too.—Gods me, my horse!— What say’st thou, Kate? What wouldst thou have with me?  LADY PERCY. Do you not love me? Do you not indeed? Well, do not, then, for since you love me not, I will not love myself. Do you not love me? Nay, tell me if you speak in jest or no.  HOTSPUR. Come, wilt thou see me ride? And when I am a-horseback I will swear I love thee infinitely. But hark you, Kate, I must not have you henceforth question me Whither I go, nor reason whereabout. Whither I must, I must; and, to conclude, This evening must I leave you, gentle Kate. I know you wise, but yet no farther wise Than Harry Percy’s wife; constant you are, But yet a woman; and for secrecy, No lady closer, for I well believe Thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know; And so far will I trust thee, gentle Kate.  LADY PERCY. How? So far?  HOTSPUR. Not an inch further. But hark you, Kate, Whither I go, thither shall you go too. Today will I set forth, tomorrow you. Will this content you, Kate?  LADY PERCY. It must, of force.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IV. Eastcheap. A Room in the Boar’s Head Tavern.  Enter Prince Henry.  PRINCE. Ned, prithee, come out of that fat room, and lend me thy hand to laugh a little.  Enter Poins.  POINS. Where hast been, Hal?  PRINCE. With three or four loggerheads amongst three or fourscore hogsheads. I have sounded the very base-string of humility. Sirrah, I am sworn brother to a leash of drawers, and can call them all by their Christian names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis. They take it already upon their salvation, that though I be but Prince of Wales, yet I am the king of courtesy, and tell me flatly I am no proud Jack, like Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a good boy,—by the Lord, so they call me—and when I am King of England, I shall command all the good lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep, “dyeing scarlet,” and when you breathe in your watering, they cry “Hem!” and bid you “Play it off!” To conclude, I am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour, that I can drink with any tinker in his own language during my life. I tell thee, Ned, thou hast lost much honour that thou wert not with me in this action; but, sweet Ned—to sweeten which name of Ned, I give thee this pennyworth of sugar, clapped even now into my hand by an underskinker, one that never spake other English in his life than “Eight shillings and sixpence,” and “You are welcome,” with this shrill addition, “Anon, anon, sir! Score a pint of bastard in the Half-moon,” or so. But, Ned, to drive away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee, do thou stand in some by-room, while I question my puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar, and do thou never leave calling “Francis,” that his tale to me may be nothing but “Anon.” Step aside, and I’ll show thee a precedent.  [_Exit Poins._]  POINS. [_Within_] Francis!  PRINCE. Thou art perfect.  POINS. [_Within_] Francis!  Enter Francis.  FRANCIS. Anon, anon, sir.—Look down into the Pomegarnet, Ralph.  PRINCE. Come hither, Francis.  FRANCIS. My lord?  PRINCE. How long hast thou to serve, Francis?  FRANCIS. Forsooth, five years, and as much as to—  POINS. [_within._] Francis!  FRANCIS. Anon, anon, sir.  PRINCE. Five year! By’r Lady, a long lease for the clinking of pewter! But, Francis, darest thou be so valiant as to play the coward with thy indenture, and show it a fair pair of heels, and run from it?  FRANCIS. O Lord, sir, I’ll be sworn upon all the books in England, I could find in my heart—  POINS. [_within._] Francis!  FRANCIS. Anon, sir.  PRINCE. How old art thou, Francis?  FRANCIS. Let me see, about Michaelmas next I shall be—  POINS. [_within._] Francis!  FRANCIS. Anon, sir.—Pray, stay a little, my lord.  PRINCE. Nay, but hark you, Francis, for the sugar thou gavest me, ’twas a pennyworth, was’t not?  FRANCIS. O Lord, I would it had been two!  PRINCE. I will give thee for it a thousand pound. Ask me when thou wilt, and thou shalt have it.  POINS. [_within._] Francis!  FRANCIS. Anon, anon.  PRINCE. Anon, Francis? No, Francis, but tomorrow, Francis; or, Francis, a Thursday; or indeed, Francis, when thou wilt. But, Francis,—  FRANCIS. My lord?  PRINCE. Wilt thou rob this leathern-jerkin, crystal-button, not-pated, agate-ring, puke-stocking, caddis-garter, smooth-tongue, Spanish-pouch—  FRANCIS. O Lord, sir, who do you mean?  PRINCE. Why, then, your brown bastard is your only drink, for look you, Francis, your white canvas doublet will sully. In Barbary, sir, it cannot come to so much.  FRANCIS. What, sir?  POINS. [_within._] Francis!  PRINCE. Away, you rogue! Dost thou not hear them call?  [_Here they both call him; the Drawer stands amazed, not knowing which way to go._]  Enter Vintner.  VINTNER. What, stand’st thou still, and hear’st such a calling? Look to the guests within.  [_Exit Francis._]  My lord, old Sir John with half-a-dozen more are at the door. Shall I let them in?  PRINCE. Let them alone awhile, and then open the door.  [_Exit Vintner._]  Poins!  Enter Poins.  POINS. Anon, anon, sir.  PRINCE. Sirrah, Falstaff and the rest of the thieves are at the door; shall we be merry?  POINS. As merry as crickets, my lad. But hark ye, what cunning match have you made with this jest of the drawer? Come, what’s the issue?  PRINCE. I am now of all humours that have showed themselves humours since the old days of goodman Adam to the pupil age of this present twelve o’clock at midnight.  Enter Francis.  What’s o’clock, Francis?  FRANCIS. Anon, anon, sir.  [_Exit Francis._]  PRINCE. That ever this fellow should have fewer words than a parrot, and yet the son of a woman! His industry is upstairs and downstairs; his eloquence the parcel of a reckoning. I am not yet of Percy’s mind, the Hotspur of the north, he that kills me some six or seven dozen of Scots at a breakfast, washes his hands, and says to his wife, “Fie upon this quiet life! I want work.” “O my sweet Harry,” says she, “how many hast thou killed today?” “Give my roan horse a drench,” says he; and answers, “Some fourteen,” an hour after; “a trifle, a trifle.” I prithee, call in Falstaff. I’ll play Percy, and that damned brawn shall play Dame Mortimer his wife. _Rivo!_ says the drunkard. Call in Ribs, call in Tallow.  Enter Falstaff, Gadshill, Bardolph and Peto; followed by Francis with wine.  POINS. Welcome, Jack. Where hast thou been?  FALSTAFF. A plague of all cowards, I say, and a vengeance too! Marry, and amen! Give me a cup of sack, boy. Ere I lead this life long, I’ll sew nether-stocks, and mend them and foot them too. A plague of all cowards! Give me a cup of sack, rogue. Is there no virtue extant?  [_Drinks._]  PRINCE. Didst thou never see Titan kiss a dish of butter (pitiful-hearted Titan!), that melted at the sweet tale of the sun’s? If thou didst, then behold that compound.  FALSTAFF. You rogue, here’s lime in this sack too: there is nothing but roguery to be found in villainous man, yet a coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime in it. A villanous coward! Go thy ways, old Jack. Die when thou wilt, if manhood, good manhood, be not forgot upon the face of the Earth, then am I a shotten herring. There lives not three good men unhanged in England, and one of them is fat, and grows old, God help the while, a bad world, I say. I would I were a weaver; I could sing psalms or anything. A plague of all cowards, I say still.  PRINCE. How now, wool-sack, what mutter you?  FALSTAFF. A king’s son! If I do not beat thee out of thy kingdom with a dagger of lath, and drive all thy subjects afore thee like a flock of wild-geese, I’ll never wear hair on my face more. You, Prince of Wales!  PRINCE. Why, you whoreson round man, what’s the matter?  FALSTAFF. Are not you a coward? Answer me to that—and Poins there?  POINS. Zounds, ye fat paunch, an ye call me coward, by the Lord, I’ll stab thee.  FALSTAFF. I call thee coward? I’ll see thee damned ere I call thee coward, but I would give a thousand pound I could run as fast as thou canst. You are straight enough in the shoulders, you care not who sees your back. Call you that backing of your friends? A plague upon such backing! Give me them that will face me.—Give me a cup of sack. I am a rogue if I drunk today.  PRINCE. O villain! Thy lips are scarce wiped since thou drunk’st last.  FALSTAFF. All is one for that. A plague of all cowards, still say I.  [_Drinks._]  PRINCE. What’s the matter?  FALSTAFF. What’s the matter? There be four of us here have ta’en a thousand pound this day morning.  PRINCE. Where is it, Jack, where is it?  FALSTAFF. Where is it? Taken from us it is: a hundred upon poor four of us.  PRINCE. What, a hundred, man?  FALSTAFF. I am a rogue if I were not at half-sword with a dozen of them two hours together. I have ’scaped by miracle. I am eight times thrust through the doublet, four through the hose, my buckler cut through and through, my sword hacked like a handsaw. _Ecce signum!_ I never dealt better since I was a man: all would not do. A plague of all cowards! Let them speak. If they speak more or less than truth, they are villains, and the sons of darkness.  PRINCE. Speak, sirs, how was it?  GADSHILL. We four set upon some dozen.  FALSTAFF. Sixteen at least, my lord.  GADSHILL. And bound them.  PETO. No, no, they were not bound.  FALSTAFF. You rogue, they were bound, every man of them, or I am a Jew else, an Ebrew Jew.  GADSHILL. As we were sharing, some six or seven fresh men set upon us.  FALSTAFF. And unbound the rest, and then come in the other.  PRINCE. What, fought you with them all?  FALSTAFF. All? I know not what you call all, but if I fought not with fifty of them I am a bunch of radish. If there were not two or three and fifty upon poor old Jack, then am I no two-legged creature.  PRINCE. Pray God you have not murdered some of them.  FALSTAFF. Nay, that’s past praying for. I have peppered two of them. Two I am sure I have paid, two rogues in buckram suits. I tell thee what, Hal, if I tell thee a lie, spit in my face, call me horse. Thou knowest my old ward. Here I lay, and thus I bore my point. Four rogues in buckram let drive at me.  PRINCE. What, four? Thou saidst but two even now.  FALSTAFF. Four, Hal, I told thee four.  POINS. Ay, ay, he said four.  FALSTAFF. These four came all afront, and mainly thrust at me. I made me no more ado, but took all their seven points in my target, thus.  PRINCE. Seven? Why, there were but four even now.  FALSTAFF. In buckram?  POINS. Ay, four, in buckram suits.  FALSTAFF. Seven, by these hilts, or I am a villain else.  PRINCE. [_aside to Poins._] Prithee let him alone, we shall have more anon.  FALSTAFF. Dost thou hear me, Hal?  PRINCE. Ay, and mark thee too, Jack.  FALSTAFF. Do so, for it is worth the listening to. These nine in buckram that I told thee of—  PRINCE. So, two more already.  FALSTAFF. Their points being broken—  POINS. Down fell their hose.  FALSTAFF. Began to give me ground; but I followed me close, came in foot and hand, and with a thought seven of the eleven I paid.  PRINCE. O monstrous! Eleven buckram men grown out of two!  FALSTAFF. But as the devil would have it, three misbegotten knaves in Kendal green came at my back and let drive at me, for it was so dark, Hal, that thou couldst not see thy hand.  PRINCE. These lies are like the father that begets them, gross as a mountain, open, palpable. Why, thou clay-brained guts, thou knotty-pated fool, thou whoreson, obscene greasy tallow-catch—  FALSTAFF. What, art thou mad? Art thou mad? Is not the truth the truth?  PRINCE. Why, how couldst thou know these men in Kendal green, when it was so dark thou couldst not see thy hand? Come, tell us your reason. What sayest thou to this?  POINS. Come, your reason, Jack, your reason.  FALSTAFF. What, upon compulsion? Zounds, an I were at the strappado, or all the racks in the world, I would not tell you on compulsion. Give you a reason on compulsion! If reasons were as plentiful as blackberries, I would give no man a reason upon compulsion, I.  PRINCE. I’ll be no longer guilty of this sin. This sanguine coward, this bed-presser, this horse-back-breaker, this huge hill of flesh—  FALSTAFF. ’Sblood, you starveling, you eel-skin, you dried neat’s-tongue, you bull’s pizzle, you stock-fish—O, for breath to utter what is like thee! You tailor’s-yard, you sheath, you bow-case, you vile standing tuck—  PRINCE. Well, breathe awhile, and then to it again, and when thou hast tired thyself in base comparisons, hear me speak but this.  POINS. Mark, Jack.  PRINCE. We two saw you four set on four, and bound them and were masters of their wealth. Mark now how a plain tale shall put you down. Then did we two set on you four, and, with a word, outfaced you from your prize, and have it, yea, and can show it you here in the house. And, Falstaff, you carried your guts away as nimbly, with as quick dexterity, and roared for mercy, and still ran and roared, as ever I heard bull-calf. What a slave art thou to hack thy sword as thou hast done, and then say it was in fight! What trick, what device, what starting-hole canst thou now find out to hide thee from this open and apparent shame?  POINS. Come, let’s hear, Jack, what trick hast thou now?  FALSTAFF. By the Lord, I knew ye as well as he that made ye. Why, hear you, my masters, was it for me to kill the heir-apparent? Should I turn upon the true prince? Why, thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules: but beware instinct. The lion will not touch the true prince. Instinct is a great matter. I was now a coward on instinct. I shall think the better of myself, and thee, during my life—I for a valiant lion, and thou for a true prince. But, by the Lord, lads, I am glad you have the money.—Hostess, clap to the doors. Watch tonight, pray tomorrow. Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold, all the titles of good fellowship come to you! What, shall we be merry? Shall we have a play extempore?  PRINCE. Content; and the argument shall be thy running away.  FALSTAFF. Ah, no more of that, Hal, an thou lovest me!  Enter the Hostess.  HOSTESS. O Jesu, my lord the Prince—  PRINCE. How now, my lady the hostess! What say’st thou to me?  HOSTESS. Marry, my lord, there is a nobleman of the court at door would speak with you: he says he comes from your father.  PRINCE. Give him as much as will make him a royal man, and send him back again to my mother.  FALSTAFF. What manner of man is he?  HOSTESS. An old man.  FALSTAFF. What doth gravity out of his bed at midnight? Shall I give him his answer?  PRINCE. Prithee do, Jack.  FALSTAFF. Faith, and I’ll send him packing.  [_Exit._]  PRINCE. Now, sirs: by’r Lady, you fought fair, so did you, Peto. So did you, Bardolph. You are lions, too, you ran away upon instinct, you will not touch the true prince, no, fie!  BARDOLPH. Faith, I ran when I saw others run.  PRINCE. Faith, tell me now in earnest, how came Falstaff’s sword so hacked?  PETO. Why, he hacked it with his dagger, and said he would swear truth out of England but he would make you believe it was done in fight, and persuaded us to do the like.  BARDOLPH. Yea, and to tickle our noses with spear-grass to make them bleed, and then to beslubber our garments with it, and swear it was the blood of true men. I did that I did not this seven year before: I blushed to hear his monstrous devices.  PRINCE. O villain, thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years ago, and wert taken with the manner, and ever since thou hast blushed extempore. Thou hadst fire and sword on thy side, and yet thou ran’st away. What instinct hadst thou for it?  BARDOLPH. My lord, do you see these meteors? Do you behold these exhalations?  PRINCE. I do.  BARDOLPH. What think you they portend?  PRINCE. Hot livers and cold purses.  BARDOLPH. Choler, my lord, if rightly taken.  PRINCE. No, if rightly taken, halter.  Enter Falstaff.  Here comes lean Jack, here comes bare-bone. How now, my sweet creature of bombast? How long is’t ago, Jack, since thou sawest thine own knee?  FALSTAFF. My own knee? When I was about thy years, Hal, I was not an eagle’s talon in the waist. I could have crept into any alderman’s thumb-ring: a plague of sighing and grief! It blows a man up like a bladder. There’s villanous news abroad: here was Sir John Bracy from your father; you must to the court in the morning. That same mad fellow of the north, Percy, and he of Wales that gave Amamon the bastinado, and made Lucifer cuckold, and swore the devil his true liegeman upon the cross of a Welsh hook—what a plague call you him?  POINS. O, Glendower.  FALSTAFF. Owen, Owen, the same; and his son-in-law Mortimer, and old Northumberland, and that sprightly Scot of Scots, Douglas, that runs a-horseback up a hill perpendicular—  PRINCE. He that rides at high speed, and with his pistol kills a sparrow flying.  FALSTAFF. You have hit it.  PRINCE. So did he never the sparrow.  FALSTAFF. Well, that rascal hath good metal in him, he will not run.  PRINCE. Why, what a rascal art thou then, to praise him so for running!  FALSTAFF. A-horseback, ye cuckoo, but afoot he will not budge a foot.  PRINCE. Yes, Jack, upon instinct.  FALSTAFF. I grant ye, upon instinct. Well, he is there too, and one Mordake, and a thousand blue-caps more. Worcester is stolen away tonight; thy father’s beard is turned white with the news. You may buy land now as cheap as stinking mackerel.  PRINCE. Why then, it is like if there come a hot June, and this civil buffeting hold, we shall buy maidenheads as they buy hobnails, by the hundreds.  FALSTAFF. By the mass, lad, thou sayest true. It is like we shall have good trading that way. But tell me, Hal, art not thou horrible afeard? Thou being heir-apparent, could the world pick thee out three such enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that spirit Percy, and that devil Glendower? Art thou not horribly afraid? Doth not thy blood thrill at it?  PRINCE. Not a whit, i’faith. I lack some of thy instinct.  FALSTAFF. Well, thou wilt be horribly chid tomorrow when thou comest to thy father. If thou love me practise an answer.  PRINCE. Do thou stand for my father and examine me upon the particulars of my life.  FALSTAFF. Shall I? Content! This chair shall be my state, this dagger my sceptre, and this cushion my crown.  PRINCE. Thy state is taken for a joint-stool, thy golden sceptre for a leaden dagger, and thy precious rich crown for a pitiful bald crown.  FALSTAFF. Well, an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee, now shalt thou be moved. Give me a cup of sack to make my eyes look red, that it may be thought I have wept, for I must speak in passion, and I will do it in King Cambyses’ vein.  PRINCE. Well, here is my leg.  FALSTAFF. And here is my speech. Stand aside, nobility.  HOSTESS. O Jesu, this is excellent sport, i faith!  FALSTAFF. Weep not, sweet Queen, for trickling tears are vain.  HOSTESS. O, the Father, how he holds his countenance!  FALSTAFF. For God’s sake, lords, convey my tristful Queen, For tears do stop the floodgates of her eyes.  HOSTESS. O Jesu, he doth it as like one of these harlotry players as ever I see!  FALSTAFF. Peace, good pint-pot; peace, good tickle-brain.—Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy time, but also how thou art accompanied. For though the camomile, the more it is trodden on, the faster it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted, the sooner it wears. That thou art my son I have partly thy mother’s word, partly my own opinion, but chiefly a villainous trick of thine eye, and a foolish hanging of thy nether lip, that doth warrant me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point: why, being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher, and eat blackberries? A question not to be asked. Shall the son of England prove a thief, and take purses? A question to be asked. There is a thing, Harry, which thou hast often heard of, and it is known to many in our land by the name of pitch. This pitch, as ancient writers do report, doth defile; so doth the company thou keepest. For, Harry, now I do not speak to thee in drink, but in tears; not in pleasure, but in passion; not in words only, but in woes also. And yet there is a virtuous man whom I have often noted in thy company, but I know not his name.  PRINCE. What manner of man, an it like your Majesty?  FALSTAFF. A goodly portly man, i’faith, and a corpulent; of a cheerful look, a pleasing eye, and a most noble carriage; and, as I think, his age some fifty, or, by’r Lady, inclining to threescore; and now I remember me, his name is Falstaff. If that man should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me; for, Harry, I see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that Falstaff; him keep with, the rest banish. And tell me now, thou naughty varlet, tell me where hast thou been this month?  PRINCE. Dost thou speak like a king? Do thou stand for me, and I’ll play my father.  FALSTAFF. Depose me? If thou dost it half so gravely, so majestically, both in word and matter, hang me up by the heels for a rabbit-sucker or a poulter’s hare.  PRINCE. Well, here I am set.  FALSTAFF. And here I stand. Judge, my masters.  PRINCE. Now, Harry, whence come you?  FALSTAFF. My noble lord, from Eastcheap.  PRINCE. The complaints I hear of thee are grievous.  FALSTAFF. ’Sblood, my lord, they are false.—Nay, I’ll tickle ye for a young prince, i’faith.  PRINCE. Swearest thou, ungracious boy? Henceforth ne’er look on me. Thou art violently carried away from grace. There is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of an old fat man. A tun of man is thy companion. Why dost thou converse with that trunk of humours, that bolting-hutch of beastliness, that swollen parcel of dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuffed cloak-bag of guts, that roasted Manningtree ox with the pudding in his belly, that reverend Vice, that grey iniquity, that father ruffian, that vanity in years? Wherein is he good, but to taste sack and drink it? Wherein neat and cleanly, but to carve a capon and eat it? Wherein cunning, but in craft? Wherein crafty, but in villany? Wherein villainous, but in all things? Wherein worthy, but in nothing?  FALSTAFF. I would your Grace would take me with you. Whom means your Grace?  PRINCE. That villainous abominable misleader of youth, Falstaff, that old white-bearded Satan.  FALSTAFF. My lord, the man I know.  PRINCE. I know thou dost.  FALSTAFF. But to say I know more harm in him than in myself were to say more than I know. That he is old, the more the pity, his white hairs do witness it. But that he is, saving your reverence, a whoremaster, that I utterly deny. If sack and sugar be a fault, God help the wicked! If to be old and merry be a sin, then many an old host that I know is damned. If to be fat be to be hated, then Pharaoh’s lean kine are to be loved. No, my good lord, banish Peto, banish Bardolph, banish Poins, but for sweet Jack Falstaff, kind Jack Falstaff, true Jack Falstaff, valiant Jack Falstaff, and therefore more valiant, being as he is old Jack Falstaff, banish not him thy Harry’s company, banish not him thy Harry’s company. Banish plump Jack, and banish all the world.  PRINCE. I do, I will.  [_A knocking heard._]  [_Exeunt Hostess, Francis and Bardolph._]  Enter Bardolph, running.  BARDOLPH. O, my lord, my lord, the sheriff with a most monstrous watch is at the door.  FALSTAFF. Out, ye rogue! Play out the play. I have much to say in the behalf of that Falstaff.  Enter the Hostess, hastily.  HOSTESS. O Jesu, my lord, my lord—  PRINCE. Heigh, heigh, the devil rides upon a fiddlestick. What’s the matter?  HOSTESS. The sheriff and all the watch are at the door. They are come to search the house. Shall I let them in?  FALSTAFF. Dost thou hear, Hal? Never call a true piece of gold a counterfeit: thou art essentially made without seeming so.  PRINCE. And thou a natural coward without instinct.  FALSTAFF. I deny your major. If you will deny the sheriff, so; if not, let him enter. If I become not a cart as well as another man, a plague on my bringing up! I hope I shall as soon be strangled with a halter as another.  PRINCE. Go hide thee behind the arras. The rest walk up above. Now, my masters, for a true face and good conscience.  FALSTAFF. Both which I have had, but their date is out, and therefore I’ll hide me.  PRINCE. Call in the sheriff.  [_Exeunt all but the Prince and Peto._]  Enter Sheriff and the Carrier.  Now, master sheriff, what is your will with me?  SHERIFF. First, pardon me, my lord. A hue and cry Hath followed certain men unto this house.  PRINCE. What men?  SHERIFF. One of them is well known, my gracious lord, A gross fat man.  CARRIER. As fat as butter.  PRINCE. The man I do assure you is not here, For I myself at this time have employ’d him. And, sheriff, I will engage my word to thee, That I will by tomorrow dinner-time, Send him to answer thee, or any man, For anything he shall be charged withal. And so let me entreat you leave the house.  SHERIFF. I will, my lord. There are two gentlemen Have in this robbery lost three hundred marks.  PRINCE. It may be so. If he have robb’d these men, He shall be answerable; and so, farewell.  SHERIFF. Good night, my noble lord.  PRINCE. I think it is good morrow, is it not?  SHERIFF. Indeed, my lord, I think it be two o’clock.  [_Exit Sheriff with the Carrier._]  PRINCE. This oily rascal is known as well as Paul’s. Go, call him forth.  PETO. Falstaff!—Fast asleep behind the arras, and snorting like a horse.  PRINCE. Hark, how hard he fetches breath. Search his pockets.  [_He searcheth his pocket, and findeth certain papers._]  What hast thou found?  PETO. Nothing but papers, my lord.  PRINCE. Let’s see what they be. Read them.  PETO.

There let him sleep till day. I’ll to the court in the morning. We must all to the wars, and thy place shall be honourable. I’ll procure this fat rogue a charge of foot, and I know his death will be a march of twelve score. The money shall be paid back again with advantage. Be with me betimes in the morning; and so, good morrow, Peto.  PETO. Good morrow, good my lord.  [_Exeunt._]
  ACT III
A thousand pound, Hal? A million. Thy love is worth a million; thou owest me thy love.  HOSTESS. Nay, my lord, he call’d you Jack, and said he would cudgel you.  FALSTAFF. Did I, Bardolph?  BARDOLPH. Indeed, Sir John, you said so.  FALSTAFF. Yea, if he said my ring was copper.  PRINCE. I say ’tis copper. Darest thou be as good as thy word now?  FALSTAFF. Why, Hal, thou knowest, as thou art but man, I dare, but as thou art prince, I fear thee as I fear the roaring of the lion’s whelp.  PRINCE. And why not as the lion?  FALSTAFF. The King himself is to be feared as the lion. Dost thou think I’ll fear thee as I fear thy father? Nay, an I do, I pray God my girdle break.  PRINCE. O, if it should, how would thy guts fall about thy knees! But, sirrah, there’s no room for faith, truth, nor honesty in this bosom of thine; it is all filled up with midriff. Charge an honest woman with picking thy pocket! Why, thou whoreson, impudent, embossed rascal, if there were anything in thy pocket but tavern reckonings, memorandums of bawdy houses, and one poor pennyworth of sugar-candy to make thee long-winded, if thy pocket were enriched with any other injuries but these, I am a villain. And yet you will stand to it, you will not pocket up wrong. Art thou not ashamed!  FALSTAFF. Dost thou hear, Hal? Thou knowest in the state of innocency Adam fell, and what should poor Jack Falstaff do in the days of villainy? Thou seest I have more flesh than another man and therefore more frailty. You confess, then, you picked my pocket?  PRINCE. It appears so by the story.  FALSTAFF. Hostess, I forgive thee. Go make ready breakfast, love thy husband, look to thy servants, cherish thy guests. Thou shalt find me tractable to any honest reason. Thou seest I am pacified still. Nay, prithee, be gone.  [_Exit Hostess._]  Now, Hal, to the news at court. For the robbery, lad, how is that answered?  PRINCE. O, my sweet beef, I must still be good angel to thee. The money is paid back again.  FALSTAFF. O, I do not like that paying back, ’tis a double labour.  PRINCE. I am good friends with my father, and may do anything.  FALSTAFF. Rob me the exchequer the first thing thou dost, and do it with unwashed hands too.  BARDOLPH. Do, my lord.  PRINCE. I have procured thee, Jack, a charge of foot.  FALSTAFF. I would it had been of horse. Where shall I find one that can steal well? O, for a fine thief, of the age of two-and-twenty or thereabouts! I am heinously unprovided. Well, God be thanked for these rebels; they offend none but the virtuous. I laud them, I praise them.  PRINCE. Bardolph!  BARDOLPH. My lord?  PRINCE. Go bear this letter to Lord John of Lancaster, To my brother John; this to my Lord of Westmoreland.  [_Exit Bardolph._]  Go, Peto, to horse, to horse, for thou and I Have thirty miles to ride yet ere dinner-time.  [_Exit Peto._]  Jack, meet me tomorrow in the Temple hall At two o’clock in the afternoon; There shalt thou know thy charge, and there receive Money and order for their furniture. The land is burning, Percy stands on high, And either we or they must lower lie.  [_Exit._]  FALSTAFF. Rare words! Brave world!—Hostess, my breakfast, come.— O, I could wish this tavern were my drum.  [_Exit._]
  ACT IV
  ACT V
SCENE I. The King’s Camp near Shrewsbury.  Enter King Henry, Prince Henry, Lancaster, Sir Walter Blunt and Sir John Falstaff.  KING. How bloodily the sun begins to peer Above yon bulky hill! The day looks pale At his distemp’rature.  PRINCE. The southern wind Doth play the trumpet to his purposes, And by his hollow whistling in the leaves Foretells a tempest and a blust’ring day.  KING. Then with the losers let it sympathize, For nothing can seem foul to those that win.  [_The trumpet sounds_.]  Enter Worcester and Vernon.  How, now, my Lord of Worcester! ’Tis not well That you and I should meet upon such terms As now we meet. You have deceived our trust, And made us doff our easy robes of peace, To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel. This is not well, my lord, this is not well. What say you to it? Will you again unknit This churlish knot of all-abhorred war, And move in that obedient orb again Where you did give a fair and natural light, And be no more an exhaled meteor, A prodigy of fear, and a portent Of broached mischief to the unborn times?  WORCESTER. Hear me, my liege: For mine own part, I could be well content To entertain the lag end of my life With quiet hours. For I do protest I have not sought the day of this dislike.  KING. You have not sought it? How comes it, then?  FALSTAFF. Rebellion lay in his way, and he found it.  PRINCE. Peace, chewet, peace!  WORCESTER. It pleased your Majesty to turn your looks Of favour from myself and all our house; And yet I must remember you, my lord, We were the first and dearest of your friends. For you my staff of office did I break In Richard’s time, and posted day and night To meet you on the way, and kiss your hand, When yet you were in place and in account Nothing so strong and fortunate as I. It was myself, my brother, and his son, That brought you home, and boldly did outdare The dangers of the time. You swore to us, And you did swear that oath at Doncaster, That you did nothing purpose ’gainst the state, Nor claim no further than your new-fall’n right, The seat of Gaunt, dukedom of Lancaster. To this we swore our aid. But in short space It rain’d down fortune show’ring on your head, And such a flood of greatness fell on you, What with our help, what with the absent King, What with the injuries of a wanton time, The seeming sufferances that you had borne, And the contrarious winds that held the King So long in his unlucky Irish wars That all in England did repute him dead: And from this swarm of fair advantages You took occasion to be quickly woo’d To gripe the general sway into your hand, Forgot your oath to us at Doncaster; And, being fed by us, you used us so As that ungentle gull, the cuckoo’s bird, Useth the sparrow—did oppress our nest, Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk That even our love durst not come near your sight For fear of swallowing; but with nimble wing We were enforced, for safety sake to fly Out of your sight, and raise this present head, Whereby we stand opposed by such means As you yourself have forged against yourself, By unkind usage, dangerous countenance, And violation of all faith and troth Sworn to us in your younger enterprise.  KING. These things, indeed, you have articulate, Proclaim’d at market crosses, read in churches, To face the garment of rebellion With some fine colour that may please the eye Of fickle changelings and poor discontents, Which gape and rub the elbow at the news Of hurlyburly innovation. And never yet did insurrection want Such water-colours to impaint his cause, Nor moody beggars starving for a time Of pellmell havoc and confusion.  PRINCE. In both your armies there is many a soul Shall pay full dearly for this encounter If once they join in trial. Tell your nephew, The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world In praise of Henry Percy. By my hopes, This present enterprise set off his head, I do not think a braver gentleman, More active-valiant or more valiant-young, More daring or more bold, is now alive To grace this latter age with noble deeds. For my part, I may speak it to my shame, I have a truant been to chivalry, And so I hear he doth account me too. Yet this before my father’s Majesty— I am content that he shall take the odds Of his great name and estimation, And will, to save the blood on either side, Try fortune with him in a single fight.  KING. And, Prince of Wales, so dare we venture thee, Albeit considerations infinite Do make against it.—No, good Worcester, no. We love our people well, even those we love That are misled upon your cousin’s part, And, will they take the offer of our grace, Both he, and they, and you, yea, every man Shall be my friend again, and I’ll be his. So tell your cousin, and then bring me word What he will do. But if he will not yield, Rebuke and dread correction wait on us, And they shall do their office. So, be gone; We will not now be troubled with reply. We offer fair, take it advisedly.  [_Exit Worcester with Vernon._]  PRINCE. It will not be accepted, on my life. The Douglas and the Hotspur both together Are confident against the world in arms.  KING. Hence, therefore, every leader to his charge; For on their answer, will we set on them, And God befriend us as our cause is just!  [_Exeunt the King, Blunt and Prince John._]  FALSTAFF. Hal, if thou see me down in the battle and bestride me, so; ’tis a point of friendship.  PRINCE. Nothing but a colossus can do thee that friendship. Say thy prayers, and farewell.  FALSTAFF. I would ’twere bedtime, Hal, and all well.  PRINCE. Why, thou owest God a death.  [_Exit._]  FALSTAFF. ’Tis not due yet, I would be loth to pay Him before His day. What need I be so forward with Him that calls not on me? Well, ’tis no matter, honour pricks me on. Yea, but how if honour prick me off when I come on? How then? Can honor set to a leg? No. Or an arm? No. Or take away the grief of a wound? No. Honour hath no skill in surgery then? No. What is honour? A word. What is in that word, “honour”? What is that “honour”? Air. A trim reckoning! Who hath it? He that died o’ Wednesday. Doth he feel it? No. Doth be hear it? No. ’Tis insensible, then? Yea, to the dead. But will it not live with the living? No. Why? Detraction will not suffer it. Therefore I’ll none of it. Honour is a mere scutcheon. And so ends my catechism.  [_Exit._]  SCENE II. The Rebel Camp.  Enter Worcester and Vernon.  WORCESTER. O no, my nephew must not know, Sir Richard, The liberal and kind offer of the King.  VERNON. ’Twere best he did.  WORCESTER. Then are we all undone. It is not possible, it cannot be, The King should keep his word in loving us; He will suspect us still, and find a time To punish this offence in other faults. Suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes, For treason is but trusted like the fox, Who, ne’er so tame, so cherish’d and lock’d up, Will have a wild trick of his ancestors. Look how we can, or sad or merrily, Interpretation will misquote our looks, And we shall feed like oxen at a stall, The better cherish’d still the nearer death. My nephew’s trespass may be well forgot, It hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood, And an adopted name of privilege— A hare-brain’d Hotspur, govern’d by a spleen. All his offences live upon my head And on his father’s. We did train him on, And, his corruption being ta’en from us, We as the spring of all shall pay for all. Therefore, good cousin, let not Harry know In any case the offer of the King.  VERNON. Deliver what you will, I’ll say ’tis so. Here comes your cousin.  Enter Hotspur and Douglas; Officers and Soldiers behind.  HOTSPUR. My uncle is return’d. Deliver up my Lord of Westmoreland. Uncle, what news?  WORCESTER. The King will bid you battle presently.  DOUGLAS. Defy him by the Lord Of Westmoreland.  HOTSPUR. Lord Douglas, go you and tell him so.  DOUGLAS. Marry, I shall, and very willingly.  [_Exit._]  WORCESTER. There is no seeming mercy in the King.  HOTSPUR. Did you beg any? God forbid!  WORCESTER. I told him gently of our grievances, Of his oath-breaking; which he mended thus, By now forswearing that he is forsworn. He calls us rebels, traitors, and will scourge With haughty arms this hateful name in us.  Enter Douglas.  DOUGLAS. Arm, gentlemen; to arms! For I have thrown A brave defiance in King Henry’s teeth, And Westmoreland, that was engaged, did bear it, Which cannot choose but bring him quickly on.  WORCESTER. The Prince of Wales stepp’d forth before the King, And, nephew, challenged you to single fight.  HOTSPUR. O, would the quarrel lay upon our heads, And that no man might draw short breath today But I and Harry Monmouth! Tell me, tell me, How show’d his tasking? Seem’d it in contempt?  VERNON. No, by my soul. I never in my life Did hear a challenge urged more modestly, Unless a brother should a brother dare To gentle exercise and proof of arms. He gave you all the duties of a man, Trimm’d up your praises with a princely tongue, Spoke your deservings like a chronicle, Making you ever better than his praise By still dispraising praise valued with you, And, which became him like a prince indeed, He made a blushing cital of himself, And chid his truant youth with such a grace As if he master’d there a double spirit Of teaching and of learning instantly. There did he pause: but let me tell the world, If he outlive the envy of this day, England did never owe so sweet a hope So much misconstrued in his wantonness.  HOTSPUR. Cousin, I think thou art enamoured Upon his follies. Never did I hear Of any prince so wild a liberty. But be he as he will, yet once ere night I will embrace him with a soldier’s arm, That he shall shrink under my courtesy. Arm, arm with speed! And, fellows, soldiers, friends, Better consider what you have to do Than I that have not well the gift of tongue Can lift your blood up with persuasion.  Enter a Messenger.  MESSENGER. My lord, here are letters for you.  HOTSPUR. I cannot read them now.— O gentlemen, the time of life is short! To spend that shortness basely were too long If life did ride upon a dial’s point, Still ending at the arrival of an hour. And if we live, we live to tread on kings; If die, brave death, when princes die with us! Now, for our consciences, the arms are fair When the intent of bearing them is just.  Enter another Messenger.  MESSENGER. My lord, prepare. The King comes on apace.  HOTSPUR. I thank him that he cuts me from my tale, For I profess not talking. Only this: Let each man do his best. And here draw I A sword whose temper I intend to stain With the best blood that I can meet withal In the adventure of this perilous day. Now, Esperance! Percy! And set on. Sound all the lofty instruments of war, And by that music let us all embrace, For, Heaven to Earth, some of us never shall A second time do such a courtesy.  [_The trumpets sound. They embrace, and exeunt._]  SCENE III. Plain between the Camps.  The King enters with his power. Alarum to the battle. Then enter Douglas and Sir Walter Blunt.  BLUNT. What is thy name that in the battle thus Thou crossest me? What honour dost thou seek Upon my head?  DOUGLAS. Know then my name is Douglas, And I do haunt thee in the battle thus Because some tell me that thou art a king.  BLUNT. They tell thee true.  DOUGLAS. The Lord of Stafford dear today hath bought Thy likeness, for instead of thee, King Harry, This sword hath ended him. So shall it thee, Unless thou yield thee as my prisoner.  BLUNT. I was not born a yielder, thou proud Scot, And thou shalt find a king that will revenge Lord Stafford’s death.  [_They fight, and Blunt is slain._]  Enter Hotspur.  HOTSPUR. O Douglas, hadst thou fought at Holmedon thus, I never had triumphed upon a Scot.  DOUGLAS. All’s done, all’s won; here breathless lies the King.  HOTSPUR. Where?  DOUGLAS. Here.  HOTSPUR. This, Douglas? No, I know this face full well. A gallant knight he was, his name was Blunt, Semblably furnish’d like the King himself.  DOUGLAS. A fool go with thy soul, whither it goes! A borrow’d title hast thou bought too dear. Why didst thou tell me that thou wert a king?  HOTSPUR. The King hath many marching in his coats.  DOUGLAS. Now, by my sword, I will kill all his coats; I’ll murder all his wardrobe, piece by piece, Until I meet the King.  HOTSPUR. Up, and away! Our soldiers stand full fairly for the day.  [_Exeunt._]  Alarums. Enter Falstaff solus.  FALSTAFF. Though I could scape shot-free at London, I fear the shot here. Here’s no scoring but upon the pate.—Soft! who are you? Sir Walter Blunt. There’s honour for you. Here’s no vanity. I am as hot as molten lead, and as heavy too. God keep lead out of me, I need no more weight than mine own bowels. I have led my ragamuffins where they are peppered. There’s not three of my hundred and fifty left alive, and they are for the town’s end, to beg during life. But who comes here?  Enter Prince Henry.  PRINCE. What, stand’st thou idle here? Lend me thy sword. Many a nobleman lies stark and stiff Under the hoofs of vaunting enemies, Whose deaths are yet unrevenged. I prithee Lend me thy sword.  FALSTAFF. O Hal, I prithee give me leave to breathe awhile. Turk Gregory never did such deeds in arms as I have done this day. I have paid Percy, I have made him sure.  PRINCE. He is indeed, and living to kill thee. I prithee, lend me thy sword.  FALSTAFF. Nay, before God, Hal, if Percy be alive, thou gett’st not my sword; but take my pistol, if thou wilt.  PRINCE. Give it me. What, is it in the case?  FALSTAFF. Ay, Hal, ’tis hot, ’tis hot. There’s that will sack a city.  [_The Prince draws out a bottle of sack._]  PRINCE. What, is it a time to jest and dally now?  [_Throws it at him, and exit._]  FALSTAFF. Well, if Percy be alive, I’ll pierce him. If he do come in my way, so; if he do not, if I come in his willingly, let him make a carbonado of me. I like not such grinning honour as Sir Walter hath. Give me life, which if I can save, so: if not, honour comes unlooked for, and there’s an end.  [_Exit._]  SCENE IV. Another Part of the Field.  Alarums. Excursions. Enter King Henry, Prince Henry, Lancaster and Westmoreland.  KING. I prithee, Harry, withdraw thyself, thou bleedest too much. Lord John of Lancaster, go you with him.  LANCASTER. Not I, my lord, unless I did bleed too.  PRINCE. I do beseech your Majesty, make up, Lest your retirement do amaze your friends.  KING. I will do so. My Lord of Westmoreland, Lead him to his tent.  WESTMORELAND. Come, my lord, I’ll lead you to your tent.  PRINCE. Lead me, my lord? I do not need your help, And God forbid a shallow scratch should drive The Prince of Wales from such a field as this, Where stain’d nobility lies trodden on, And rebels’ arms triumph in massacres!  LANCASTER. We breathe too long. Come, cousin Westmoreland, Our duty this way lies. For God’s sake, come.  [_Exeunt Lancaster and Westmoreland._]  PRINCE. By Heaven, thou hast deceived me, Lancaster, I did not think thee lord of such a spirit. Before, I loved thee as a brother, John, But now I do respect thee as my soul.  KING. I saw him hold Lord Percy at the point With lustier maintenance than I did look for Of such an ungrown warrior.  PRINCE. O, this boy Lends mettle to us all!  [_Exit._]  Enter Douglas.  DOUGLAS. Another king! They grow like Hydra’s heads. I am the Douglas, fatal to all those That wear those colours on them. What art thou That counterfeit’st the person of a king?  KING. The King himself, who, Douglas, grieves at heart So many of his shadows thou hast met, And not the very King. I have two boys Seek Percy and thyself about the field, But, seeing thou fall’st on me so luckily, I will assay thee, and defend thyself.  DOUGLAS. I fear thou art another counterfeit, And yet, in faith, thou bearest thee like a king. But mine I am sure thou art, whoe’er thou be, And thus I win thee.  They fight; the King being in danger, enter Prince Henry.  PRINCE. Hold up thy head, vile Scot, or thou art like Never to hold it up again! The spirits Of valiant Shirley, Stafford, Blunt are in my arms. It is the Prince of Wales that threatens thee, Who never promiseth but he means to pay.  [_They fight. Douglas flies._]  Cheerly, my lord. How fares your Grace? Sir Nicholas Gawsey hath for succour sent, And so hath Clifton. I’ll to Clifton straight.  KING. Stay and breathe awhile. Thou hast redeem’d thy lost opinion, And show’d thou mak’st some tender of my life, In this fair rescue thou hast brought to me.  PRINCE. O God, they did me too much injury That ever said I hearken’d for your death. If it were so, I might have let alone The insulting hand of Douglas over you, Which would have been as speedy in your end As all the poisonous potions in the world, And saved the treacherous labour of your son.  KING. Make up to Clifton. I’ll to Sir Nicholas Gawsey.  [_Exit._]  Enter Hotspur.  HOTSPUR. If I mistake not, thou art Harry Monmouth.  PRINCE. Thou speak’st as if I would deny my name.  HOTSPUR. My name is Harry Percy.  PRINCE. Why then I see A very valiant rebel of the name. I am the Prince of Wales; and think not, Percy, To share with me in glory any more. Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere, Nor can one England brook a double reign, Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales.  HOTSPUR. Nor shall it, Harry, for the hour is come To end the one of us, and would to God Thy name in arms were now as great as mine!  PRINCE. I’ll make it greater ere I part from thee, And all the budding honours on thy crest I’ll crop to make a garland for my head.  HOTSPUR. I can no longer brook thy vanities.  [_They fight._]  Enter Falstaff.  FALSTAFF. Well said, Hal! To it, Hal! Nay, you shall find no boy’s play here, I can tell you.  Enter Douglas. He fights with Falstaff, who falls down as if he were dead, and exit Douglas. The Prince kills Hotspur.  HOTSPUR. O Harry, thou hast robb’d me of my youth! I better brook the loss of brittle life Than those proud titles thou hast won of me; They wound my thoughts worse than thy sword my flesh. But thoughts, the slaves of life, and life, time’s fool, And time, that takes survey of all the world, Must have a stop. O, I could prophesy, But that the earthy and cold hand of death Lies on my tongue. No, Percy, thou art dust, And food for—  [_Dies._]  PRINCE. For worms, brave Percy. Fare thee well, great heart! Ill-weaved ambition, how much art thou shrunk! When that this body did contain a spirit, A kingdom for it was too small a bound; But now two paces of the vilest earth Is room enough. This earth that bears thee dead Bears not alive so stout a gentleman. If thou wert sensible of courtesy, I should not make so dear a show of zeal. But let my favours hide thy mangled face; And even in thy behalf I’ll thank myself For doing these fair rites of tenderness. Adieu, and take thy praise with thee to heaven! Thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave, But not remember’d in thy epitaph!  [_Sees Falstaff on the ground._]  What, old acquaintance, could not all this flesh Keep in a little life? Poor Jack, farewell! I could have better spared a better man. O, I should have a heavy miss of thee If I were much in love with vanity. Death hath not struck so fat a deer today, Though many dearer, in this bloody fray. Embowell’d will I see thee by and by, Till then in blood by noble Percy lie.  [_Exit._]  Falstaff rises up.  FALSTAFF. Embowell’d! If thou embowel me today, I’ll give you leave to powder me and eat me too tomorrow. ’Sblood, ’twas time to counterfeit, or that hot termagant Scot had paid me scot and lot too. Counterfeit? I lie, I am no counterfeit. To die, is to be a counterfeit, for he is but the counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man: but to counterfeit dying, when a man thereby liveth, is to be no counterfeit, but the true and perfect image of life indeed. The better part of valour is discretion, in the which better part I have saved my life. Zounds, I am afraid of this gunpowder Percy, though he be dead. How if he should counterfeit too, and rise? By my faith, I am afraid he would prove the better counterfeit. Therefore I’ll make him sure, yea, and I’ll swear I killed him. Why may not he rise as well as I? Nothing confutes me but eyes, and nobody sees me. Therefore, sirrah, with a new wound in your thigh, come you along with me.  [_Takes Hotspur on his back._]  Enter Prince Henry and Lancaster.  PRINCE. Come, brother John, full bravely hast thou flesh’d Thy maiden sword.  LANCASTER. But soft, whom have we here? Did you not tell me this fat man was dead?  PRINCE. I did; I saw him dead, Breathless and bleeding on the ground.—Art thou alive? Or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight? I prithee, speak, we will not trust our eyes Without our ears. Thou art not what thou seem’st.  FALSTAFF. No, that’s certain, I am not a double man. But if I be not Jack Falstaff, then am I a Jack. There is Percy! [_Throwing the body down._] If your father will do me any honour, so; if not, let him kill the next Percy himself. I look to be either earl or duke, I can assure you.  PRINCE. Why, Percy I kill’d myself, and saw thee dead.  FALSTAFF. Didst thou? Lord, Lord, how this world is given to lying! I grant you I was down and out of breath, and so was he, but we rose both at an instant, and fought a long hour by Shrewsbury clock. If I may be believed, so; if not, let them that should reward valour bear the sin upon their own heads. I’ll take it upon my death, I gave him this wound in the thigh. If the man were alive, and would deny it, zounds, I would make him eat a piece of my sword.  LANCASTER. This is the strangest tale that ever I heard.  PRINCE. This is the strangest fellow, brother John.— Come, bring your luggage nobly on your back. For my part, if a lie may do thee grace, I’ll gild it with the happiest terms I have.  [_A retreat is sounded._]  The trumpet sounds retreat; the day is ours. Come, brother, let us to the highest of the field, To see what friends are living, who are dead.  [_Exeunt Prince Henry and Lancaster._]  FALSTAFF. I’ll follow, as they say, for reward. He that rewards me, God reward him! If I do grow great, I’ll grow less, for I’ll purge, and leave sack, and live cleanly as a nobleman should do.  [_Exit, bearing off the body._]  SCENE V. Another Part of the Field.  The trumpets sound. Enter King Henry, Prince Henry, Lancaster, Westmoreland and others, with Worcester and Vernon prisoners.  KING. Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke. Ill-spirited Worcester, did not we send grace, Pardon, and terms of love to all of you? And wouldst thou turn our offers contrary? Misuse the tenour of thy kinsman’s trust? Three knights upon our party slain today, A noble earl, and many a creature else, Had been alive this hour, If, like a Christian, thou hadst truly borne Betwixt our armies true intelligence.  WORCESTER. What I have done my safety urged me to; And I embrace this fortune patiently, Since not to be avoided it falls on me.  KING. Bear Worcester to the death, and Vernon too. Other offenders we will pause upon.  [_Exeunt Worcester and Vernon, guarded._]  How goes the field?  PRINCE. The noble Scot, Lord Douglas, when he saw The fortune of the day quite turn’d from him, The noble Percy slain, and all his men Upon the foot of fear, fled with the rest, And, falling from a hill, he was so bruised That the pursuers took him. At my tent The Douglas is, and I beseech your Grace I may dispose of him.  KING. With all my heart.  PRINCE. Then, brother John of Lancaster, to you This honourable bounty shall belong. Go to the Douglas and deliver him Up to his pleasure, ransomless and free. His valours shown upon our crests today Hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds, Even in the bosom of our adversaries.  LANCASTER. I thank your Grace for this high courtesy, Which I shall give away immediately.  KING. Then this remains, that we divide our power. You, son John, and my cousin Westmoreland, Towards York shall bend you with your dearest speed To meet Northumberland and the prelate Scroop, Who, as we hear, are busily in arms. Myself and you, son Harry, will towards Wales, To fight with Glendower and the Earl of March. Rebellion in this land shall lose his sway, Meeting the check of such another day, And since this business so fair is done, Let us not leave till all our own be won.  [_Exeunt._]

Warkworth. Before the castle.  Enter Rumour, painted full of tongues.  RUMOUR. Open your ears; for which of you will stop The vent of hearing when loud Rumour speaks? I, from the orient to the drooping west, Making the wind my post-horse, still unfold The acts commenced on this ball of earth. Upon my tongues continual slanders ride, The which in every language I pronounce, Stuffing the ears of men with false reports. I speak of peace, while covert enmity Under the smile of safety wounds the world. And who but Rumour, who but only I, Make fearful musters and prepared defence, Whiles the big year, swoln with some other grief, Is thought with child by the stern tyrant war, And no such matter? Rumour is a pipe Blown by surmises, jealousies, conjectures, And of so easy and so plain a stop That the blunt monster with uncounted heads, The still-discordant wav’ring multitude, Can play upon it. But what need I thus My well-known body to anatomize Among my household? Why is Rumour here? I run before King Harry’s victory, Who in a bloody field by Shrewsbury Hath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops, Quenching the flame of bold rebellion Even with the rebels’ blood. But what mean I To speak so true at first? My office is To noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell Under the wrath of noble Hotspur’s sword, And that the King before the Douglas’ rage Stoop’d his anointed head as low as death. This have I rumour’d through the peasant towns Between that royal field of Shrewsbury And this worm-eaten hold of ragged stone, Where Hotspur’s father, old Northumberland, Lies crafty-sick. The posts come tiring on, And not a man of them brings other news Than they have learnt of me. From Rumour’s tongues They bring smooth comforts false, worse than true wrongs.   [_Exit._]
  ACT I  SCENE I. The same.  Enter Lord Bardolph.  LORD BARDOLPH. Who keeps the gate here, ho?  The Porter opens the gate.  Where is the Earl?  PORTER. What shall I say you are?  LORD BARDOLPH. Tell thou the Earl That the Lord Bardolph doth attend him here.  PORTER. His lordship is walk’d forth into the orchard. Please it your honour knock but at the gate, And he himself will answer.  Enter Northumberland.  LORD BARDOLPH. Here comes the Earl.   [_Exit Porter._]  NORTHUMBERLAND. What news, Lord Bardolph? Every minute now Should be the father of some stratagem. The times are wild; contention, like a horse Full of high feeding, madly hath broke loose And bears down all before him.  LORD BARDOLPH. Noble earl, I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury.  NORTHUMBERLAND. Good, an God will!  LORD BARDOLPH. As good as heart can wish. The King is almost wounded to the death; And, in the fortune of my lord your son, Prince Harry slain outright; and both the Blunts Kill’d by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John And Westmoreland and Stafford fled the field; And Harry Monmouth’s brawn, the hulk Sir John, Is prisoner to your son. O, such a day, So fought, so follow’d and so fairly won, Came not till now to dignify the times Since Caesar’s fortunes!  NORTHUMBERLAND. How is this derived? Saw you the field? Came you from Shrewsbury?  LORD BARDOLPH. I spake with one, my lord, that came from thence, A gentleman well bred and of good name, That freely render’d me these news for true.  NORTHUMBERLAND. Here comes my servant Travers, whom I sent On Tuesday last to listen after news.  Enter Travers.  LORD BARDOLPH. My lord, I over-rode him on the way, And he is furnish’d with no certainties More than he haply may retail from me.  NORTHUMBERLAND. Now, Travers, what good tidings comes with you?  TRAVERS. My lord, Sir John Umfrevile turn’d me back With joyful tidings, and, being better horsed, Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard A gentleman, almost forspent with speed, That stopp’d by me to breathe his bloodied horse. He ask’d the way to Chester, and of him I did demand what news from Shrewsbury. He told me that rebellion had bad luck And that young Harry Percy’s spur was cold. With that he gave his able horse the head, And bending forward struck his armed heels Against the panting sides of his poor jade Up to the rowel-head, and starting so He seem’d in running to devour the way, Staying no longer question.  NORTHUMBERLAND. Ha? Again: Said he young Harry Percy’s spur was cold? Of Hotspur, Coldspur? That rebellion Had met ill luck?  LORD BARDOLPH. My lord, I’ll tell you what: If my young lord your son have not the day, Upon mine honour, for a silken point I’ll give my barony, never talk of it.  NORTHUMBERLAND. Why should that gentleman that rode by Travers Give then such instances of loss?  LORD BARDOLPH. Who, he? He was some hilding fellow that had stolen The horse he rode on, and, upon my life, Spoke at a venture. Look, here comes more news.  Enter Morton.  NORTHUMBERLAND. Yea, this man’s brow, like to a title-leaf, Foretells the nature of a tragic volume. So looks the strand whereon the imperious flood Hath left a witness’d usurpation. Say, Morton, didst thou come from Shrewsbury?  MORTON. I ran from Shrewsbury, my noble lord, Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask To fright our party.  NORTHUMBERLAND. How doth my son and brother? Thou tremblest, and the whiteness in thy cheek Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand. Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless, So dull, so dread in look, so woe-begone, Drew Priam’s curtain in the dead of night, And would have told him half his Troy was burnt; But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue, And I my Percy’s death ere thou report’st it. This thou wouldst say: “Your son did thus and thus; Your brother thus; so fought the noble Douglas” Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds: But in the end, to stop my ear indeed, Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise, Ending with “Brother, son, and all are dead.”  MORTON. Douglas is living, and your brother, yet; But, for my lord your son—  NORTHUMBERLAND. Why, he is dead. See what a ready tongue suspicion hath! He that but fears the thing he would not know Hath by instinct knowledge from others’ eyes That what he fear’d is chanced. Yet speak, Morton; Tell thou an earl his divination lies, And I will take it as a sweet disgrace And make thee rich for doing me such wrong.  MORTON. You are too great to be by me gainsaid, Your spirit is too true, your fears too certain.  NORTHUMBERLAND. Yet, for all this, say not that Percy’s dead. I see a strange confession in thine eye. Thou shakest thy head and hold’st it fear or sin To speak a truth. If he be slain, say so. The tongue offends not that reports his death; And he doth sin that doth belie the dead, Not he which says the dead is not alive. Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news Hath but a losing office, and his tongue Sounds ever after as a sullen bell, Remember’d tolling a departing friend.  LORD BARDOLPH. I cannot think, my lord, your son is dead.  MORTON. I am sorry I should force you to believe That which I would to God I had not seen; But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state, Rend’ring faint quittance, wearied and outbreathed, To Harry Monmouth, whose swift wrath beat down The never-daunted Percy to the earth, From whence with life he never more sprung up. In few, his death, whose spirit lent a fire Even to the dullest peasant in his camp, Being bruited once, took fire and heat away From the best-temper’d courage in his troops; For from his metal was his party steel’d, Which once in him abated, all the rest Turn’d on themselves, like dull and heavy lead. And as the thing that’s heavy in itself Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed, So did our men, heavy in Hotspur’s loss, Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim Than did our soldiers, aiming at their safety, Fly from the field. Then was that noble Worcester Too soon ta’en prisoner; and that furious Scot, The bloody Douglas, whose well-labouring sword Had three times slain th’ appearance of the King, Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame Of those that turn’d their backs, and in his flight, Stumbling in fear, was took. The sum of all Is that the King hath won, and hath sent out A speedy power to encounter you, my lord, Under the conduct of young Lancaster And Westmoreland. This is the news at full.  NORTHUMBERLAND. For this I shall have time enough to mourn. In poison there is physic; and these news, Having been well, that would have made me sick, Being sick, have in some measure made me well. And as the wretch, whose fever-weaken’d joints, Like strengthless hinges, buckle under life, Impatient of his fit, breaks like a fire Out of his keeper’s arms, even so my limbs, Weaken’d with grief, being now enraged with grief, Are thrice themselves. Hence, therefore, thou nice crutch! A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel Must glove this hand. And hence, thou sickly coif! Thou art a guard too wanton for the head Which princes, flesh’d with conquest, aim to hit. Now bind my brows with iron, and approach The ragged’st hour that time and spite dare bring To frown upon th’ enraged Northumberland! Let heaven kiss earth! Now let not Nature’s hand Keep the wild flood confined! Let order die! And let this world no longer be a stage To feed contention in a lingering act; But let one spirit of the first-born Cain Reign in all bosoms, that, each heart being set On bloody courses, the rude scene may end, And darkness be the burier of the dead!  LORD BARDOLPH. This strained passion doth you wrong, my lord.  MORTON. Sweet earl, divorce not wisdom from your honour. The lives of all your loving complices Lean on your health; the which, if you give o’er To stormy passion, must perforce decay. You cast th’ event of war, my noble lord, And summ’d the account of chance, before you said “Let us make head.” It was your presurmise That in the dole of blows your son might drop. You knew he walk’d o’er perils, on an edge, More likely to fall in than to get o’er. You were advised his flesh was capable Of wounds and scars, and that his forward spirit Would lift him where most trade of danger ranged. Yet did you say “Go forth;” and none of this, Though strongly apprehended, could restrain The stiff-borne action. What hath then befall’n, Or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth, More than that being which was like to be?  LORD BARDOLPH. We all that are engaged to this loss Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas That if we wrought out life ’twas ten to one; And yet we ventured, for the gain proposed Choked the respect of likely peril fear’d; And since we are o’erset, venture again. Come, we will put forth, body and goods.  MORTON. ’Tis more than time. And, my most noble lord, I hear for certain, and dare speak the truth: The gentle Archbishop of York is up With well-appointed powers. He is a man Who with a double surety binds his followers. My lord your son had only but the corpse, But shadows and the shows of men, to fight; For that same word, “rebellion” did divide The action of their bodies from their souls, And they did fight with queasiness, constrain’d, As men drink potions, that their weapons only Seem’d on our side; but, for their spirits and souls, This word, “rebellion,” it had froze them up, As fish are in a pond. But now the bishop Turns insurrection to religion. Supposed sincere and holy in his thoughts, He’s follow’d both with body and with mind, And doth enlarge his rising with the blood Of fair King Richard, scraped from Pomfret stones; Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause; Tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land, Gasping for life under great Bolingbroke; And more and less do flock to follow him.  NORTHUMBERLAND. I knew of this before; but, to speak truth, This present grief had wiped it from my mind. Go in with me, and counsel every man The aptest way for safety and revenge. Get posts and letters, and make friends with speed. Never so few, and never yet more need.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. London. A street.  Enter Falstaff, with his Page bearing his sword and buckler.  FALSTAFF. Sirrah, you giant, what says the doctor to my water?  PAGE. He said, sir, the water itself was a good healthy water; but, for the party that owed it, he might have moe diseases than he knew for.  FALSTAFF. Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me. The brain of this foolish-compounded clay, man, is not able to invent anything that tends to laughter more than I invent, or is invented on me. I am not only witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in other men. I do here walk before thee like a sow that hath overwhelmed all her litter but one. If the Prince put thee into my service for any other reason than to set me off, why then I have no judgement. Thou whoreson mandrake, thou art fitter to be worn in my cap than to wait at my heels. I was never manned with an agate till now, but I will inset you neither in gold nor silver, but in vile apparel, and send you back again to your master, for a jewel,—the juvenal, the Prince your master, whose chin is not yet fledge. I will sooner have a beard grow in the palm of my hand than he shall get one off his cheek; and yet he will not stick to say his face is a face-royal. God may finish it when He will, ’tis not a hair amiss yet. He may keep it still at a face-royal, for a barber shall never earn sixpence out of it. And yet he’ll be crowing as if he had writ man ever since his father was a bachelor. He may keep his own grace, but he’s almost out of mine, I can assure him. What said Master Dommelton about the satin for my short cloak and my slops?  PAGE. He said, sir, you should procure him better assurance than Bardolph. He would not take his band and yours, he liked not the security.  FALSTAFF. Let him be damned like the glutton! Pray God his tongue be hotter! A whoreson Achitophel! A rascally yea-forsooth knave, to bear a gentleman in hand, and then stand upon security! The whoreson smooth-pates do now wear nothing but high shoes and bunches of keys at their girdles; and if a man is through with them in honest taking up, then they must stand upon security. I had as lief they would put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with security. I looked he should have sent me two and twenty yards of satin, as I am a true knight, and he sends me “security”. Well, he may sleep in security, for he hath the horn of abundance, and the lightness of his wife shines through it; and yet cannot he see, though he have his own lanthorn to light him. Where’s Bardolph?  PAGE. He’s gone into Smithfield to buy your worship a horse.  FALSTAFF. I bought him in Paul’s, and he’ll buy me a horse in Smithfield. An I could get me but a wife in the stews, I were manned, horsed, and wived.  Enter the Lord Chief Justice and Servant.  PAGE. Sir, here comes the nobleman that committed the Prince for striking him about Bardolph.  FALSTAFF. Wait close, I will not see him.  CHIEF JUSTICE. What’s he that goes there?  SERVANT. Falstaff, an ’t please your lordship.  CHIEF JUSTICE. He that was in question for the robbery?  SERVANT. He, my lord; but he hath since done good service at Shrewsbury, and, as I hear, is now going with some charge to the Lord John of Lancaster.  CHIEF JUSTICE. What, to York? Call him back again.  SERVANT. Sir John Falstaff!  FALSTAFF. Boy, tell him I am deaf.  PAGE. You must speak louder, my master is deaf.  CHIEF JUSTICE. I am sure he is, to the hearing of anything good. Go pluck him by the elbow, I must speak with him.  SERVANT. Sir John!  FALSTAFF. What! A young knave, and begging! Is there not wars? Is there not employment? Doth not the King lack subjects? Do not the rebels need soldiers? Though it be a shame to be on any side but one, it is worse shame to beg than to be on the worst side, were it worse than the name of rebellion can tell how to make it.  SERVANT. You mistake me, sir.  FALSTAFF. Why, sir, did I say you were an honest man? Setting my knighthood and my soldiership aside, I had lied in my throat if I had said so.  SERVANT. I pray you, sir, then set your knighthood and your soldiership aside, and give me leave to tell you, you lie in your throat, if you say I am any other than an honest man.  FALSTAFF. I give thee leave to tell me so? I lay aside that which grows to me? If thou get’st any leave of me, hang me; if thou tak’st leave, thou wert better be hanged. You hunt counter. Hence! Avaunt!  SERVANT. Sir, my lord would speak with you.  CHIEF JUSTICE. Sir John Falstaff, a word with you.  FALSTAFF. My good lord! God give your lordship good time of day. I am glad to see your lordship abroad. I heard say your lordship was sick. I hope your lordship goes abroad by advice. Your lordship, though not clean past your youth, hath yet some smack of age in you, some relish of the saltness of time; and I most humbly beseech your lordship to have a reverend care of your health.  CHIEF JUSTICE. Sir John, I sent for you before your expedition to Shrewsbury.  FALSTAFF. An ’t please your lordship, I hear his Majesty is returned with some discomfort from Wales.  CHIEF JUSTICE. I talk not of his Majesty. You would not come when I sent for you.  FALSTAFF. And I hear, moreover, his Highness is fallen into this same whoreson apoplexy.  CHIEF JUSTICE. Well, God mend him! I pray you let me speak with you.  FALSTAFF. This apoplexy, as I take it, is a kind of lethargy, an ’t please your lordship, a kind of sleeping in the blood, a whoreson tingling.  CHIEF JUSTICE. What tell you me of it? Be it as it is.  FALSTAFF. It hath it original from much grief, from study and perturbation of the brain. I have read the cause of his effects in Galen. It is a kind of deafness.  CHIEF JUSTICE. I think you are fallen into the disease, for you hear not what I say to you.  FALSTAFF. Very well, my lord, very well. Rather, an ’t please you, it is the disease of not listening, the malady of not marking, that I am troubled withal.  CHIEF JUSTICE. To punish you by the heels would amend the attention of your ears, and I care not if I do become your physician.  FALSTAFF. I am as poor as Job, my lord, but not so patient. Your lordship may minister the potion of imprisonment to me in respect of poverty; but how I should be your patient to follow your prescriptions, the wise may make some dram of a scruple, or indeed a scruple itself.  CHIEF JUSTICE. I sent for you, when there were matters against you for your life, to come speak with me.  FALSTAFF. As I was then advised by my learned counsel in the laws of this land-service, I did not come.  CHIEF JUSTICE. Well, the truth is, Sir John, you live in great infamy.  FALSTAFF. He that buckles himself in my belt cannot live in less.  CHIEF JUSTICE. Your means are very slender, and your waste is great.  FALSTAFF. I would it were otherwise, I would my means were greater and my waist slenderer.  CHIEF JUSTICE. You have misled the youthful prince.  FALSTAFF. The young prince hath misled me. I am the fellow with the great belly, and he my dog.  CHIEF JUSTICE. Well, I am loath to gall a new-healed wound. Your day’s service at Shrewsbury hath a little gilded over your night’s exploit on Gad’s Hill. You may thank th’ unquiet time for your quiet o’er-posting that action.  FALSTAFF. My lord!  CHIEF JUSTICE. But since all is well, keep it so: wake not a sleeping wolf.  FALSTAFF. To wake a wolf is as bad as smell a fox.  CHIEF JUSTICE. What! You are as a candle, the better part burnt out.  FALSTAFF. A wassail candle, my lord, all tallow. If I did say of wax, my growth would approve the truth.  CHIEF JUSTICE. There is not a white hair in your face but should have his effect of gravity.  FALSTAFF. His effect of gravy, gravy, gravy.  CHIEF JUSTICE. You follow the young prince up and down, like his ill angel.  FALSTAFF. Not so, my lord, your ill angel is light, but I hope he that looks upon me will take me without weighing. And yet in some respects, I grant, I cannot go. I cannot tell. Virtue is of so little regard in these costermongers’ times that true valour is turned bearherd; pregnancy is made a tapster, and hath his quick wit wasted in giving reckonings. All the other gifts appertinent to man, as the malice of this age shapes them, are not worth a gooseberry. You that are old consider not the capacities of us that are young; you do measure the heat of our livers with the bitterness of your galls, and we that are in the vaward of our youth, I must confess, are wags too.  CHIEF JUSTICE. Do you set down your name in the scroll of youth, that are written down old with all the characters of age? Have you not a moist eye, a dry hand, a yellow cheek, a white beard, a decreasing leg, an increasing belly? Is not your voice broken, your wind short, your chin double, your wit single, and every part about you blasted with antiquity? And will you yet call yourself young? Fie, fie, fie, Sir John!  FALSTAFF. My lord, I was born about three of the clock in the afternoon, with a white head and something a round belly. For my voice, I have lost it with halloing and singing of anthems. To approve my youth further, I will not. The truth is, I am only old in judgement and understanding; and he that will caper with me for a thousand marks, let him lend me the money, and have at him! For the box of the ear that the Prince gave you, he gave it like a rude prince, and you took it like a sensible lord. I have checked him for it, and the young lion repents. Marry, not in ashes and sackcloth, but in new silk and old sack.  CHIEF JUSTICE. Well, God send the Prince a better companion!  FALSTAFF. God send the companion a better prince! I cannot rid my hands of him.  CHIEF JUSTICE. Well, the King hath severed you and Prince Harry. I hear you are going with Lord John of Lancaster against the Archbishop and the Earl of Northumberland.  FALSTAFF. Yea, I thank your pretty sweet wit for it. But look you pray, all you that kiss my lady Peace at home, that our armies join not in a hot day; for, by the Lord, I take but two shirts out with me, and I mean not to sweat extraordinarily. If it be a hot day, and I brandish anything but a bottle, I would I might never spit white again. There is not a dangerous action can peep out his head but I am thrust upon it. Well, I cannot last ever. But it was alway yet the trick of our English nation, if they have a good thing, to make it too common. If ye will needs say I am an old man, you should give me rest. I would to God my name were not so terrible to the enemy as it is. I were better to be eaten to death with a rust than to be scoured to nothing with perpetual motion.  CHIEF JUSTICE. Well, be honest, be honest, and God bless your expedition!  FALSTAFF. Will your lordship lend me a thousand pound to furnish me forth?  CHIEF JUSTICE. Not a penny, not a penny; you are too impatient to bear crosses. Fare you well: commend me to my cousin Westmoreland.   [_Exeunt Chief Justice and Servant._]  FALSTAFF. If I do, fillip me with a three-man beetle. A man can no more separate age and covetousness than he can part young limbs and lechery: but the gout galls the one, and the pox pinches the other; and so both the degrees prevent my curses. Boy!  PAGE. Sir?  FALSTAFF. What money is in my purse?  PAGE. Seven groats and two pence.  FALSTAFF. I can get no remedy against this consumption of the purse. Borrowing only lingers and lingers it out, but the disease is incurable. Go bear this letter to my Lord of Lancaster; this to the Prince; this to the Earl of Westmoreland; and this to old Mistress Ursula, whom I have weekly sworn to marry since I perceived the first white hair of my chin. About it. You know where to find me. [_Exit Page_.] A pox of this gout! or a gout of this pox! for the one or the other plays the rogue with my great toe. ’Tis no matter if I do halt; I have the wars for my colour, and my pension shall seem the more reasonable. A good wit will make use of anything. I will turn diseases to commodity.   [_Exit._]  SCENE III. York. The Archbishop’s palace.  Enter the Archbishop, the Lords Hastings, Mowbray and Bardolph.  ARCHBISHOP. Thus have you heard our cause and known our means, And, my most noble friends, I pray you all Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes. And first, Lord Marshal, what say you to it?  MOWBRAY. I well allow the occasion of our arms, But gladly would be better satisfied How in our means we should advance ourselves To look with forehead bold and big enough Upon the power and puissance of the King.  HASTINGS. Our present musters grow upon the file To five and twenty thousand men of choice; And our supplies live largely in the hope Of great Northumberland, whose bosom burns With an incensed fire of injuries.  LORD BARDOLPH. The question then, Lord Hastings, standeth thus: Whether our present five and twenty thousand May hold up head without Northumberland.  HASTINGS. With him we may.  LORD BARDOLPH. Yea, marry, there’s the point: But if without him we be thought too feeble, My judgement is, we should not step too far Till we had his assistance by the hand; For in a theme so bloody-faced as this Conjecture, expectation, and surmise Of aids incertain should not be admitted.  ARCHBISHOP. ’Tis very true, Lord Bardolph, for indeed It was young Hotspur’s case at Shrewsbury.  LORD BARDOLPH. It was, my lord; who lined himself with hope, Eating the air on promise of supply, Flatt’ring himself in project of a power Much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts, And so, with great imagination Proper to madmen, led his powers to death And winking leap’d into destruction.  HASTINGS. But, by your leave, it never yet did hurt To lay down likelihoods and forms of hope.  LORD BARDOLPH. Yes, if this present quality of war— Indeed the instant action, a cause on foot— Lives so in hope, as in an early spring We see th’ appearing buds; which to prove fruit Hope gives not so much warrant as despair That frosts will bite them. When we mean to build, We first survey the plot, then draw the model, And when we see the figure of the house, Then we must rate the cost of the erection, Which if we find outweighs ability, What do we then but draw anew the model In fewer offices, or at least desist To build at all? Much more, in this great work, Which is almost to pluck a kingdom down And set another up, should we survey The plot of situation and the model, Consent upon a sure foundation, Question surveyors, know our own estate, How able such a work to undergo, To weigh against his opposite; or else We fortify in paper and in figures, Using the names of men instead of men, Like one that draws the model of a house Beyond his power to build it, who, half through, Gives o’er and leaves his part-created cost A naked subject to the weeping clouds And waste for churlish winter’s tyranny.  HASTINGS. Grant that our hopes, yet likely of fair birth, Should be still-born, and that we now possess’d The utmost man of expectation, I think we are a body strong enough, Even as we are, to equal with the King.  LORD BARDOLPH. What, is the King but five and twenty thousand?  HASTINGS. To us no more; nay, not so much, Lord Bardolph; For his divisions, as the times do brawl, Are in three heads: one power against the French, And one against Glendower; perforce a third Must take up us. So is the unfirm king In three divided, and his coffers sound With hollow poverty and emptiness.  ARCHBISHOP. That he should draw his several strengths together And come against us in full puissance Need not be dreaded.  HASTINGS. If he should do so, He leaves his back unarm’d, the French and Welsh Baying him at the heels: never fear that.  LORD BARDOLPH. Who is it like should lead his forces hither?  HASTINGS. The Duke of Lancaster and Westmoreland; Against the Welsh, himself and Harry Monmouth; But who is substituted ’gainst the French I have no certain notice.  ARCHBISHOP. Let us on, And publish the occasion of our arms. The commonwealth is sick of their own choice; Their over-greedy love hath surfeited. An habitation giddy and unsure Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart. O thou fond many, with what loud applause Didst thou beat heaven with blessing Bolingbroke, Before he was what thou wouldst have him be! And being now trimm’d in thine own desires, Thou, beastly feeder, art so full of him That thou provok’st thyself to cast him up. So, so, thou common dog, didst thou disgorge Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard; And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up, And howl’st to find it. What trust is in these times? They that, when Richard lived, would have him die Are now become enamour’d on his grave. Thou that threw’st dust upon his goodly head When through proud London he came sighing on After th’ admired heels of Bolingbroke, Criest now “O earth, yield us that king again, And take thou this!” O thoughts of men accursed! Past and to come seems best; things present, worst.  MOWBRAY. Shall we go draw our numbers, and set on?  HASTINGS. We are time’s subjects, and time bids be gone.   [_Exeunt._]
  ACT II  SCENE I. London. A street.  Enter Hostess with two Officers, Fang and Snare, following.  HOSTESS. Master Fang, have you entered the action?  FANG. It is entered.  HOSTESS. Where’s your yeoman? Is ’t a lusty yeoman? Will he stand to ’t?  FANG. Sirrah, where’s Snare?  HOSTESS. O Lord, ay! Good Master Snare.  SNARE. Here, here.  FANG. Snare, we must arrest Sir John Falstaff.  HOSTESS. Yea, good Master Snare, I have entered him and all.  SNARE. It may chance cost some of our lives, for he will stab.  HOSTESS. Alas the day, take heed of him. He stabbed me in mine own house, and that most beastly, in good faith. He cares not what mischief he does, if his weapon be out, he will foin like any devil. He will spare neither man, woman, nor child.  FANG. If I can close with him, I care not for his thrust.  HOSTESS. No, nor I neither. I’ll be at your elbow.  FANG. An I but fist him once, an he come but within my vice,—  HOSTESS. I am undone by his going, I warrant you, he’s an infinitive thing upon my score. Good Master Fang, hold him sure. Good Master Snare, let him not ’scape. He comes continuantly to Pie Corner—saving your manhoods—to buy a saddle, and he is indited to dinner to the Lubber’s Head in Lumbert Street, to Master Smooth’s the silkman. I pray you, since my exion is entered, and my case so openly known to the world, let him be brought in to his answer. A hundred mark is a long one for a poor lone woman to bear, and I have borne, and borne, and borne, and have been fubbed off, and fubbed off, and fubbed off, from this day to that day, that it is a shame to be thought on. There is no honesty in such dealing, unless a woman should be made an ass and a beast, to bear every knave’s wrong. Yonder he comes, and that arrant malmsey-nose knave, Bardolph, with him. Do your offices, do your offices, Master Fang and Master Snare, do me, do me, do me your offices.  Enter Falstaff, Bardolph and Page.  FALSTAFF. How now, whose mare’s dead? What’s the matter?  FANG. Sir John, I arrest you at the suit of Mistress Quickly.  FALSTAFF. Away, varlets! Draw, Bardolph! Cut me off the villain’s head. Throw the quean in the channel.  HOSTESS. Throw me in the channel? I’ll throw thee in the channel. Wilt thou, wilt thou, thou bastardly rogue? Murder, murder! Ah, thou honeysuckle villain, wilt thou kill God’s officers and the King’s? Ah, thou honeyseed rogue, thou art a honeyseed, a man-queller, and a woman-queller.  FALSTAFF. Keep them off, Bardolph.  FANG. A rescue! A rescue!  HOSTESS. Good people, bring a rescue or two. Thou wo’t, wo’t thou? Thou wo’t, wo’t ta? Do, do, thou rogue! Do, thou hempseed!  PAGE. Away, you scullion! you rampallian! you fustilarian! I’ll tickle your catastrophe.  Enter the Lord Chief Justice and his men.  CHIEF JUSTICE. What is the matter? Keep the peace here, ho!  HOSTESS. Good my lord, be good to me. I beseech you stand to me.  CHIEF JUSTICE. How now, Sir John? What are you brawling here? Doth this become your place, your time and business? You should have been well on your way to York. Stand from him, fellow. Wherefore hang’st thou upon him?  HOSTESS. O my most worshipful lord, an’t please your Grace, I am a poor widow of Eastcheap, and he is arrested at my suit.  CHIEF JUSTICE. For what sum?  HOSTESS. It is more than for some, my lord; it is for all, all I have. He hath eaten me out of house and home. He hath put all my substance into that fat belly of his: but I will have some of it out again, or I will ride thee o’ nights like the mare.  FALSTAFF. I think I am as like to ride the mare if I have any vantage of ground to get up.  CHIEF JUSTICE. How comes this, Sir John? Fie! what man of good temper would endure this tempest of exclamation? Are you not ashamed to enforce a poor widow to so rough a course to come by her own?  FALSTAFF. What is the gross sum that I owe thee?  HOSTESS. Marry, if thou wert an honest man, thyself and the money too. Thou didst swear to me upon a parcel-gilt goblet, sitting in my Dolphin chamber, at the round table, by a sea-coal fire, upon Wednesday in Wheeson week, when the Prince broke thy head for liking his father to a singing-man of Windsor, thou didst swear to me then, as I was washing thy wound, to marry me and make me my lady thy wife. Canst thou deny it? Did not goodwife Keech, the butcher’s wife, come in then and call me gossip Quickly? coming in to borrow a mess of vinegar, telling us she had a good dish of prawns, whereby thou didst desire to eat some, whereby I told thee they were ill for green wound? And didst thou not, when she was gone downstairs, desire me to be no more so familiarity with such poor people, saying that ere long they should call me madam? And didst thou not kiss me, and bid me fetch thee thirty shillings? I put thee now to thy book-oath. Deny it, if thou canst.  FALSTAFF. My lord, this is a poor mad soul, and she says up and down the town that her eldest son is like you. She hath been in good case, and the truth is, poverty hath distracted her. But for these foolish officers, I beseech you I may have redress against them.  CHIEF JUSTICE. Sir John, Sir John, I am well acquainted with your manner of wrenching the true cause the false way. It is not a confident brow, nor the throng of words that come with such more than impudent sauciness from you, can thrust me from a level consideration. You have, as it appears to me, practised upon the easy-yielding spirit of this woman, and made her serve your uses both in purse and in person.  HOSTESS. Yea, in truth, my lord.  CHIEF JUSTICE. Pray thee, peace. Pay her the debt you owe her, and unpay the villany you have done with her. The one you may do with sterling money, and the other with current repentance.  FALSTAFF. My lord, I will not undergo this sneap without reply. You call honourable boldness impudent sauciness; if a man will make curtsy and say nothing, he is virtuous. No, my lord, my humble duty remembered, I will not be your suitor. I say to you, I do desire deliverance from these officers, being upon hasty employment in the King’s affairs.  CHIEF JUSTICE. You speak as having power to do wrong; but answer in th’ effect of your reputation, and satisfy the poor woman.  FALSTAFF. Come hither, hostess.  Enter Gower.  CHIEF JUSTICE. Now, Master Gower, what news?  GOWER. The King, my lord, and Harry Prince of Wales Are near at hand: the rest the paper tells.  FALSTAFF. As I am a gentleman.  HOSTESS. Faith, you said so before.  FALSTAFF. As I am a gentleman. Come, no more words of it.  HOSTESS. By this heavenly ground I tread on, I must be fain to pawn both my plate and the tapestry of my dining-chambers.  FALSTAFF. Glasses, glasses, is the only drinking. And for thy walls, a pretty slight drollery, or the story of the Prodigal, or the German hunting in waterwork, is worth a thousand of these bed-hangers and these fly-bitten tapestries. Let it be ten pound, if thou canst. Come, an ’twere not for thy humours, there’s not a better wench in England. Go, wash thy face, and draw the action. Come, thou must not be in this humour with me; dost not know me? Come, come, I know thou wast set on to this.  HOSTESS. Pray thee, Sir John, let it be but twenty nobles. I’ faith, I am loath to pawn my plate, so God save me, la!  FALSTAFF. Let it alone, I’ll make other shift: you’ll be a fool still.  HOSTESS. Well, you shall have it, though I pawn my gown. I hope you’ll come to supper. You’ll pay me all together?  FALSTAFF. Will I live? [_To Bardolph_.] Go, with her, with her. Hook on, hook on.  HOSTESS. Will you have Doll Tearsheet meet you at supper?  FALSTAFF. No more words, let’s have her.   [_Exeunt Hostess, Fang, Snare, Bardolph and Page._]  CHIEF JUSTICE. I have heard better news.  FALSTAFF. What’s the news, my lord?  CHIEF JUSTICE. Where lay the King tonight?  GOWER. At Basingstoke, my lord.  FALSTAFF. I hope, my lord, all’s well. What is the news, my lord?  CHIEF JUSTICE. Come all his forces back?  GOWER. No, fifteen hundred foot, five hundred horse Are march’d up to my Lord of Lancaster, Against Northumberland and the Archbishop.  FALSTAFF. Comes the King back from Wales, my noble lord?  CHIEF JUSTICE. You shall have letters of me presently. Come, go along with me, good Master Gower.  FALSTAFF. My lord!  CHIEF JUSTICE. What’s the matter?  FALSTAFF. Master Gower, shall I entreat you with me to dinner?  GOWER. I must wait upon my good lord here, I thank you, good Sir John.  CHIEF JUSTICE. Sir John, you loiter here too long, being you are to take soldiers up in counties as you go.  FALSTAFF. Will you sup with me, Master Gower?  CHIEF JUSTICE. What foolish master taught you these manners, Sir John?  FALSTAFF. Master Gower, if they become me not, he was a fool that taught them me. This is the right fencing grace, my lord; tap for tap, and so part fair.  CHIEF JUSTICE. Now the Lord lighten thee, thou art a great fool.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. London. Another street.  Enter Prince Henry and Poins.  PRINCE. Before God, I am exceeding weary.  POINS. Is ’t come to that? I had thought weariness durst not have attached one of so high blood.  PRINCE. Faith, it does me, though it discolours the complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it. Doth it not show vilely in me to desire small beer?  POINS. Why, a prince should not be so loosely studied as to remember so weak a composition.  PRINCE. Belike then my appetite was not princely got, for, by my troth, I do now remember the poor creature small beer. But indeed, these humble considerations make me out of love with my greatness. What a disgrace is it to me to remember thy name! or to know thy face tomorrow! or to take note how many pair of silk stockings thou hast—viz. these, and those that were thy peach-coloured ones! or to bear the inventory of thy shirts, as, one for superfluity, and another for use! But that the tennis-court keeper knows better than I, for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when thou keepest not racket there; as thou hast not done a great while, because the rest of thy low countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland. And God knows whether those that bawl out of the ruins of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom: but the midwives say the children are not in the fault; whereupon the world increases, and kindreds are mightily strengthened.  POINS. How ill it follows, after you have laboured so hard, you should talk so idly! Tell me, how many good young princes would do so, their fathers being so sick as yours at this time is?  PRINCE. Shall I tell thee one thing, Poins?  POINS. Yes, faith, and let it be an excellent good thing.  PRINCE. It shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine.  POINS. Go to, I stand the push of your one thing that you will tell.  PRINCE. Marry, I tell thee it is not meet that I should be sad, now my father is sick; albeit I could tell to thee, as to one it pleases me, for fault of a better, to call my friend, I could be sad, and sad indeed too.  POINS. Very hardly upon such a subject.  PRINCE. By this hand, thou thinkest me as far in the devil’s book as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and persistency. Let the end try the man. But I tell thee, my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so sick; and keeping such vile company as thou art hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow.  POINS. The reason?  PRINCE. What wouldst thou think of me if I should weep?  POINS. I would think thee a most princely hypocrite.  PRINCE. It would be every man’s thought; and thou art a blessed fellow to think as every man thinks. Never a man’s thought in the world keeps the roadway better than thine: every man would think me an hypocrite indeed. And what accites your most worshipful thought to think so?  POINS. Why, because you have been so lewd and so much engraffed to Falstaff.  PRINCE. And to thee.  POINS. By this light, I am well spoke on; I can hear it with mine own ears. The worst that they can say of me is that I am a second brother, and that I am a proper fellow of my hands; and those two things, I confess, I cannot help. By the mass, here comes Bardolph.  Enter Bardolph and Page.  PRINCE. And the boy that I gave Falstaff. He had him from me Christian, and look if the fat villain have not transformed him ape.  BARDOLPH. God save your Grace!  PRINCE. And yours, most noble Bardolph!  POINS. Come, you virtuous ass, you bashful fool, must you be blushing? Wherefore blush you now? What a maidenly man-at-arms are you become! Is ’t such a matter to get a pottle-pot’s maidenhead?  PAGE. He calls me e’en now, my lord, through a red lattice, and I could discern no part of his face from the window. At last I spied his eyes, and methought he had made two holes in the ale-wife’s new petticoat and so peeped through.  PRINCE. Has not the boy profited?  BARDOLPH. Away, you whoreson upright rabbit, away!  PAGE. Away, you rascally Althaea’s dream, away!  PRINCE. Instruct us, boy; what dream, boy?  PAGE. Marry, my lord, Althaea dreamt she was delivered of a firebrand; and therefore I call him her dream.  PRINCE. A crown’s worth of good interpretation. There ’tis, boy.  POINS. O, that this blossom could be kept from cankers! Well, there is sixpence to preserve thee.  BARDOLPH. An you do not make him be hanged among you, the gallows shall have wrong.  PRINCE. And how doth thy master, Bardolph?  BARDOLPH. Well, my lord. He heard of your Grace’s coming to town. There’s a letter for you.  POINS. Delivered with good respect. And how doth the martlemas, your master?  BARDOLPH. In bodily health, sir.  POINS. Marry, the immortal part needs a physician, but that moves not him. Though that be sick, it dies not.  PRINCE. I do allow this wen to be as familiar with me as my dog, and he holds his place, for look you how he writes.  POINS. [_Reads_.] “John Falstaff, knight,” Every man must know that, as oft as he has occasion to name himself: even like those that are kin to the King, for they never prick their finger but they say, “There’s some of the King’s blood spilt.” “How comes that?” says he that takes upon him not to conceive. The answer is as ready as a borrower’s cap, “I am the King’s poor cousin, sir.”  PRINCE. Nay, they will be kin to us, or they will fetch it from Japhet. But to the letter: “Sir John Falstaff, knight, to the son of the King, nearest his father, Harry Prince of Wales, greeting.”  POINS. Why, this is a certificate.  PRINCE. Peace! “I will imitate the honourable Romans in brevity.”  POINS. He sure means brevity in breath, short-winded.  PRINCE. “I commend me to thee, I commend thee, and I leave thee. Be not too familiar with Poins, for he misuses thy favours so much that he swears thou art to marry his sister Nell. Repent at idle times as thou mayst, and so, farewell. Thine by yea and no, which is as much as to say, as thou usest him—Jack Falstaff with my familiars, John with my brothers and sisters, and Sir John with all Europe.”  POINS. My lord, I’ll steep this letter in sack and make him eat it.  PRINCE. That’s to make him eat twenty of his words. But do you use me thus, Ned? Must I marry your sister?  POINS. God send the wench no worse fortune! But I never said so.  PRINCE. Well, thus we play the fools with the time, and the spirits of the wise sit in the clouds and mock us. Is your master here in London?  BARDOLPH. Yea, my lord.  PRINCE. Where sups he? Doth the old boar feed in the old frank?  BARDOLPH. At the old place, my lord, in Eastcheap.  PRINCE. What company?  PAGE. Ephesians, my lord, of the old church.  PRINCE. Sup any women with him?  PAGE. None, my lord, but old Mistress Quickly and Mistress Doll Tearsheet.  PRINCE. What pagan may that be?  PAGE. A proper gentlewoman, sir, and a kinswoman of my master’s.  PRINCE. Even such kin as the parish heifers are to the town bull. Shall we steal upon them, Ned, at supper?  POINS. I am your shadow, my lord, I’ll follow you.  PRINCE. Sirrah, you boy, and Bardolph, no word to your master that I am yet come to town. There’s for your silence.  BARDOLPH. I have no tongue, sir.  PAGE. And for mine, sir, I will govern it.  PRINCE. Fare you well; go.   [_Exeunt Bardolph and Page._]  This Doll Tearsheet should be some road.  POINS. I warrant you, as common as the way between Saint Albans and London.  PRINCE. How might we see Falstaff bestow himself tonight in his true colours, and not ourselves be seen?  POINS. Put on two leathern jerkins and aprons, and wait upon him at his table as drawers.  PRINCE. From a god to a bull? A heavy descension! It was Jove’s case. From a prince to a ’prentice? A low transformation that shall be mine, for in everything the purpose must weigh with the folly. Follow me, Ned.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. Warkworth. Before the castle.  Enter Northumberland, Lady Northumberland and Lady Percy.  NORTHUMBERLAND. I pray thee, loving wife, and gentle daughter, Give even way unto my rough affairs; Put not you on the visage of the times And be like them to Percy troublesome.  LADY NORTHUMBERLAND. I have given over, I will speak no more. Do what you will; your wisdom be your guide.  NORTHUMBERLAND. Alas, sweet wife, my honour is at pawn, And, but my going, nothing can redeem it.  LADY PERCY. O yet, for God’s sake, go not to these wars! The time was, father, that you broke your word, When you were more endear’d to it than now; When your own Percy, when my heart’s dear Harry, Threw many a northward look to see his father Bring up his powers; but he did long in vain. Who then persuaded you to stay at home? There were two honours lost, yours and your son’s. For yours, the God of heaven brighten it! For his, it stuck upon him as the sun In the grey vault of heaven, and by his light Did all the chivalry of England move To do brave acts. He was indeed the glass Wherein the noble youth did dress themselves. He had no legs that practis’d not his gait; And speaking thick, which nature made his blemish, Became the accents of the valiant; For those who could speak low and tardily Would turn their own perfection to abuse, To seem like him. So that in speech, in gait, In diet, in affections of delight, In military rules, humours of blood, He was the mark and glass, copy and book, That fashion’d others. And him—O wondrous him! O miracle of men!—him did you leave, Second to none, unseconded by you, To look upon the hideous god of war In disadvantage, to abide a field Where nothing but the sound of Hotspur’s name Did seem defensible: so you left him. Never, O never, do his ghost the wrong To hold your honour more precise and nice With others than with him! Let them alone. The Marshal and the Archbishop are strong: Had my sweet Harry had but half their numbers, Today might I, hanging on Hotspur’s neck, Have talk’d of Monmouth’s grave.  NORTHUMBERLAND. Beshrew your heart, Fair daughter, you do draw my spirits from me With new lamenting ancient oversights. But I must go and meet with danger there, Or it will seek me in another place, And find me worse provided.  LADY NORTHUMBERLAND. O, fly to Scotland, Till that the nobles and the armed commons Have of their puissance made a little taste.  LADY PERCY. If they get ground and vantage of the King, Then join you with them like a rib of steel, To make strength stronger; but, for all our loves, First let them try themselves. So did your son; He was so suffer’d. So came I a widow, And never shall have length of life enough To rain upon remembrance with mine eyes, That it may grow and sprout as high as heaven For recordation to my noble husband.  NORTHUMBERLAND. Come, come, go in with me. ’Tis with my mind As with the tide swell’d up unto his height, That makes a still-stand, running neither way. Fain would I go to meet the Archbishop, But many thousand reasons hold me back. I will resolve for Scotland. There am I, Till time and vantage crave my company.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IV. London. The Boar’s head Tavern in Eastcheap.  Enter two Drawers.  FIRST DRAWER. What the devil hast thou brought there—applejohns? Thou knowest Sir John cannot endure an applejohn.  SECOND DRAWER. Mass, thou sayest true. The Prince once set a dish of applejohns before him, and told him there were five more Sir Johns, and, putting off his hat, said “I will now take my leave of these six dry, round, old, withered knights.” It angered him to the heart. But he hath forgot that.  FIRST DRAWER. Why then, cover, and set them down, and see if thou canst find out Sneak’s noise. Mistress Tearsheet would fain hear some music. Dispatch. The room where they supped is too hot, they’ll come in straight.  SECOND DRAWER. Sirrah, here will be the Prince and Master Poins anon, and they will put on two of our jerkins and aprons, and Sir John must not know of it. Bardolph hath brought word.  FIRST DRAWER. By the mass, here will be old utis. It will be an excellent stratagem.  SECOND DRAWER. I’ll see if I can find out Sneak.   [_Exit._]  Enter Hostess and Doll Tearsheet.  HOSTESS. I’ faith, sweetheart, methinks now you are in an excellent good temperality. Your pulsidge beats as extraordinarily as heart would desire, and your colour, I warrant you, is as red as any rose, in good truth, la! But, i’ faith, you have drunk too much canaries, and that’s a marvellous searching wine, and it perfumes the blood ere one can say “What’s this?” How do you now?  DOLL. Better than I was. Hem!  HOSTESS. Why, that’s well said. A good heart’s worth gold. Lo, here comes Sir John.  Enter Falstaff.  FALSTAFF. [_Singing_.] “When Arthur first in court”—Empty the jordan. [_Exit First Drawer_.]—[_Singing_.] “And was a worthy king.” How now, Mistress Doll!  HOSTESS. Sick of a calm, yea, good faith.  FALSTAFF. So is all her sect; an they be once in a calm, they are sick.  DOLL. A pox damn you, you muddy rascal, is that all the comfort you give me?  FALSTAFF. You make fat rascals, Mistress Doll.  DOLL. I make them? Gluttony and diseases make them; I make them not.  FALSTAFF. If the cook help to make the gluttony, you help to make the diseases, Doll: we catch of you, Doll. We catch of you; grant that, my poor virtue, grant that.  DOLL. Yea, joy, our chains and our jewels.  FALSTAFF. “Your brooches, pearls, and ouches:”—for to serve bravely is to come halting off, you know; to come off the breach with his pike bent bravely, and to surgery bravely; to venture upon the charged chambers bravely—  DOLL. Hang yourself, you muddy conger, hang yourself!  HOSTESS. By my troth, this is the old fashion; you two never meet but you fall to some discord. You are both, i’ good truth, as rheumatic as two dry toasts. You cannot one bear with another’s confirmities. What the good-year! One must bear, and that must be you. You are the weaker vessel, as as they say, the emptier vessel.  DOLL. Can a weak empty vessel bear such a huge full hogshead? There’s a whole merchant’s venture of Bourdeaux stuff in him; you have not seen a hulk better stuffed in the hold. Come, I’ll be friends with thee, Jack. Thou art going to the wars, and whether I shall ever see thee again or no, there is nobody cares.  Enter First Drawer.  FIRST DRAWER. Sir, Ancient Pistol’s below, and would speak with you.  DOLL. Hang him, swaggering rascal! Let him not come hither: it is the foul-mouthed’st rogue in England.  HOSTESS. If he swagger, let him not come here. No, by my faith, I must live among my neighbours. I’ll no swaggerers. I am in good name and fame with the very best. Shut the door, there comes no swaggerers here. I have not lived all this while to have swaggering now. Shut the door, I pray you.  FALSTAFF. Dost thou hear, hostess?  HOSTESS. Pray ye pacify yourself, Sir John. There comes no swaggerers here.  FALSTAFF. Dost thou hear? It is mine ancient.  HOSTESS. Tilly-fally, Sir John, ne’er tell me. And our ancient swaggerer comes not in my doors. I was before Master Tisick, the debuty t’other day, and, as he said to me,—’twas no longer ago than Wednesday last, i’ good faith,—“Neighbour Quickly,” says he—Master Dumb, our minister, was by then—“Neighbour Quickly,” says he, “receive those that are civil, for,” said he “you are in an ill name.” Now he said so, I can tell whereupon. “For,” says he, “you are an honest woman, and well thought on. Therefore take heed what guests you receive. Receive,” says he, “no swaggering companions.” There comes none here. You would bless you to hear what he said. No, I’ll no swaggerers.  FALSTAFF. He’s no swaggerer, hostess; a tame cheater, i’ faith, you may stroke him as gently as a puppy greyhound. He’ll not swagger with a Barbary hen, if her feathers turn back in any show of resistance. Call him up, drawer.   [_Exit First Drawer._]  HOSTESS. Cheater, call you him? I will bar no honest man my house, nor no cheater, but I do not love swaggering, by my troth, I am the worse when one says “swagger.” Feel, masters, how I shake; look you, I warrant you.  DOLL. So you do, hostess.  HOSTESS. Do I? Yea, in very truth, do I, an ’twere an aspen leaf. I cannot abide swaggerers.  Enter Pistol, Bardolph and Page.  PISTOL. God save you, Sir John!  FALSTAFF. Welcome, Ancient Pistol. Here, Pistol, I charge you with a cup of sack. Do you discharge upon mine hostess.  PISTOL. I will discharge upon her, Sir John, with two bullets.  FALSTAFF. She is pistol-proof, sir; you shall not hardly offend her.  HOSTESS. Come, I’ll drink no proofs nor no bullets. I’ll drink no more than will do me good, for no man’s pleasure, I.  PISTOL. Then to you, Mistress Dorothy! I will charge you.  DOLL. Charge me! I scorn you, scurvy companion. What, you poor, base, rascally, cheating, lack-linen mate! Away, you mouldy rogue, away! I am meat for your master.  PISTOL. I know you, Mistress Dorothy.  DOLL. Away, you cut-purse rascal, you filthy bung, away! By this wine, I’ll thrust my knife in your mouldy chaps an you play the saucy cuttle with me. Away, you bottle-ale rascal, you basket-hilt stale juggler, you! Since when, I pray you, sir? God’s light, with two points on your shoulder? Much!  PISTOL. God let me not live, but I will murder your ruff for this.  FALSTAFF. No more, Pistol! I would not have you go off here. Discharge yourself of our company, Pistol.  HOSTESS. No, good Captain Pistol, not here, sweet captain.  DOLL. Captain! Thou abominable damned cheater, art thou not ashamed to be called captain? An captains were of my mind, they would truncheon you out, for taking their names upon you before you have earned them. You a captain? You slave, for what? For tearing a poor whore’s ruff in a bawdy-house? He a captain! Hang him, rogue, he lives upon mouldy stewed prunes and dried cakes. A captain? God’s light, these villains will make the word as odious as the word “occupy,” which was an excellent good word before it was ill sorted. Therefore captains had need look to’t.  BARDOLPH. Pray thee go down, good ancient.  FALSTAFF. Hark thee hither, Mistress Doll.  PISTOL. Not I. I tell thee what, Corporal Bardolph, I could tear her. I’ll be revenged of her.  PAGE. Pray thee go down.  PISTOL. I’ll see her damned first to Pluto’s damned lake, by this hand, to th’ infernal deep, with Erebus and tortures vile also. Hold hook and line, say I. Down, down, dogs! Down, faitors! Have we not Hiren here?  HOSTESS. Good Captain Peesel, be quiet, ’tis very late, i’ faith. I beseek you now, aggravate your choler.  PISTOL. These be good humours, indeed! Shall packhorses And hollow pamper’d jades of Asia, Which cannot go but thirty mile a day, Compare with Caesars and with Cannibals, And Trojant Greeks? Nay, rather damn them with King Cerberus; and let the welkin roar. Shall we fall foul for toys?  HOSTESS. By my troth, captain, these are very bitter words.  BARDOLPH. Be gone, good ancient. This will grow to a brawl anon.  PISTOL. Die men like dogs! Give crowns like pins! Have we not Hiren here?  HOSTESS. O’ my word, captain, there’s none such here. What the good-year, do you think I would deny her? For God’s sake, be quiet.  PISTOL. Then feed and be fat, my fair Calipolis. Come, give ’s some sack. _Si fortune me tormente, sperato me contento._ Fear we broadsides? No, let the fiend give fire. Give me some sack; and, sweetheart, lie thou there.   [_Laying down his sword._]  Come we to full points here? And are etceteras nothings?  FALSTAFF. Pistol, I would be quiet.  PISTOL. Sweet knight, I kiss thy neaf. What! we have seen the seven stars.  DOLL. For God’s sake, thrust him downstairs. I cannot endure such a fustian rascal.  PISTOL. Thrust him downstairs? Know we not Galloway nags?  FALSTAFF. Quoit him down, Bardolph, like a shove-groat shilling. Nay, an he do nothing but speak nothing, he shall be nothing here.  BARDOLPH. Come, get you downstairs.  PISTOL. What! shall we have incision? Shall we imbrue?   [_Snatching up his sword._]  Then death rock me asleep, abridge my doleful days! Why then, let grievous, ghastly, gaping wounds Untwind the Sisters Three! Come, Atropos, I say!  HOSTESS. Here’s goodly stuff toward!  FALSTAFF. Give me my rapier, boy.  DOLL. I pray thee, Jack, I pray thee, do not draw.  FALSTAFF. Get you downstairs.   [_Drawing, and driving Pistol out._]  HOSTESS. Here’s a goodly tumult! I’ll forswear keeping house, afore I’ll be in these tirrits and frights. So, murder, I warrant now. Alas, alas, put up your naked weapons, put up your naked weapons.   [_Exeunt Bardolph and Pistol._]  DOLL. I pray thee, Jack, be quiet. The rascal’s gone. Ah, you whoreson little valiant villain, you!  HOSTESS. Are you not hurt i’ th’ groin? Methought he made a shrewd thrust at your belly.  Enter Bardolph.  FALSTAFF. Have you turned him out o’ doors?  BARDOLPH. Yea, sir. The rascal’s drunk. You have hurt him, sir, i’ th’ shoulder.  FALSTAFF. A rascal, to brave me!  DOLL. Ah, you sweet little rogue, you! Alas, poor ape, how thou sweat’st! Come, let me wipe thy face. Come on, you whoreson chops. Ah, rogue! i’ faith, I love thee. Thou art as valorous as Hector of Troy, worth five of Agamemnon, and ten times better than the Nine Worthies. Ah, villain!  FALSTAFF. A rascally slave! I will toss the rogue in a blanket.  DOLL. Do, an thou darest for thy heart. An thou dost, I’ll canvass thee between a pair of sheets.  Enter Music.  PAGE. The music is come, sir.  FALSTAFF. Let them play. Play, sirs. Sit on my knee, Doll. A rascal bragging slave! The rogue fled from me like quicksilver.  DOLL. I’ faith, and thou followedst him like a church. Thou whoreson little tidy Bartholomew boar-pig, when wilt thou leave fighting a-days and foining a-nights, and begin to patch up thine old body for heaven?  Enter, behind, Prince Henry and Poins, disguised as drawers.  FALSTAFF. Peace, good Doll, do not speak like a death’s-head; do not bid me remember mine end.  DOLL. Sirrah, what humour ’s the Prince of?  FALSTAFF. A good shallow young fellow; he would have made a good pantler; he would ha’ chipped bread well.  DOLL. They say Poins has a good wit.  FALSTAFF. He a good wit? Hang him, baboon! His wit’s as thick as Tewksbury mustard; there’s no more conceit in him than is in a mallet.  DOLL. Why does the Prince love him so, then?  FALSTAFF. Because their legs are both of a bigness, and he plays at quoits well, and eats conger and fennel, and drinks off candles’ ends for flap-dragons, and rides the wild mare with the boys, and jumps upon joint stools, and swears with a good grace, and wears his boots very smooth like unto the sign of the Leg, and breeds no bate with telling of discreet stories, and such other gambol faculties he has that show a weak mind and an able body, for the which the Prince admits him: for the Prince himself is such another. The weight of a hair will turn the scales between their avoirdupois.  PRINCE. Would not this nave of a wheel have his ears cut off?  POINS. Let’s beat him before his whore.  PRINCE. Look whe’er the withered elder hath not his poll clawed like a parrot.  POINS. Is it not strange that desire should so many years outlive performance?  FALSTAFF. Kiss me, Doll.  PRINCE. Saturn and Venus this year in conjunction! What says th’ almanac to that?  POINS. And look whether the fiery Trigon, his man, be not lisping to his master’s old tables, his note-book, his counsel-keeper.  FALSTAFF. Thou dost give me flattering busses.  DOLL. By my troth, I kiss thee with a most constant heart.  FALSTAFF. I am old, I am old.  DOLL. I love thee better than I love e’er a scurvy young boy of them all.  FALSTAFF. What stuff wilt have a kirtle of? I shall receive money o’ Thursday; shalt have a cap tomorrow. A merry song! Come, it grows late, we’ll to bed. Thou’lt forget me when I am gone.  DOLL. By my troth, thou’lt set me a-weeping an thou sayest so. Prove that ever I dress myself handsome till thy return. Well, hearken a’ th’ end.  FALSTAFF. Some sack, Francis.  PRINCE & POINS. Anon, anon, sir.   [_Coming forward._]  FALSTAFF. Ha! A bastard son of the King’s? And art thou not Poins his brother?  PRINCE. Why, thou globe of sinful continents, what a life dost thou lead!  FALSTAFF. A better than thou. I am a gentleman, thou art a drawer.  PRINCE. Very true, sir, and I come to draw you out by the ears.  HOSTESS. O, the Lord preserve thy Grace! By my troth, welcome to London. Now, the Lord bless that sweet face of thine! O Jesu, are you come from Wales?  FALSTAFF. Thou whoreson mad compound of majesty, by this light flesh and corrupt blood, thou art welcome.  DOLL. How? You fat fool, I scorn you.  POINS. My lord, he will drive you out of your revenge and turn all to a merriment, if you take not the heat.  PRINCE. You whoreson candle-mine, you, how vilely did you speak of me even now before this honest, virtuous, civil gentlewoman!  HOSTESS. God’s blessing of your good heart! and so she is, by my troth.  FALSTAFF. Didst thou hear me?  PRINCE. Yea, and you knew me, as you did when you ran away by Gad’s Hill. You knew I was at your back, and spoke it on purpose to try my patience.  FALSTAFF. No, no, no, not so; I did not think thou wast within hearing.  PRINCE. I shall drive you then to confess the wilful abuse, and then I know how to handle you.  FALSTAFF. No abuse, Hal, o’ mine honour, no abuse.  PRINCE. Not to dispraise me, and call me pantler and bread-chipper and I know not what?  FALSTAFF. No abuse, Hal.  POINS. No abuse?  FALSTAFF. No abuse, Ned, i’ th’ world, honest Ned, none. I dispraised him before the wicked, that the wicked might not fall in love with thee; in which doing, I have done the part of a careful friend and a true subject, and thy father is to give me thanks for it. No abuse, Hal; none, Ned, none; no, faith, boys, none.  PRINCE. See now whether pure fear and entire cowardice doth not make thee wrong this virtuous gentlewoman to close with us. Is she of the wicked? Is thine hostess here of the wicked? Or is thy boy of the wicked? Or honest Bardolph, whose zeal burns in his nose, of the wicked?  POINS. Answer, thou dead elm, answer.  FALSTAFF. The fiend hath pricked down Bardolph irrecoverable, and his face is Lucifer’s privy-kitchen, where he doth nothing but roast malt-worms. For the boy, there is a good angel about him, but the devil outbids him too.  PRINCE. For the women?  FALSTAFF. For one of them, she’s in hell already, and burns poor souls. For th’ other, I owe her money, and whether she be damned for that I know not.  HOSTESS. No, I warrant you.  FALSTAFF. No, I think thou art not, I think thou art quit for that. Marry, there is another indictment upon thee, for suffering flesh to be eaten in thy house, contrary to the law, for the which I think thou wilt howl.  HOSTESS. All victuallers do so. What’s a joint of mutton or two in a whole Lent?  PRINCE. You, gentlewoman.  DOLL. What says your Grace?  FALSTAFF. His grace says that which his flesh rebels against.   [Peto _knocks at door._]  HOSTESS. Who knocks so loud at door? Look to th’ door there, Francis.  Enter Peto.  PRINCE. Peto, how now, what news?  PETO. The King your father is at Westminster, And there are twenty weak and wearied posts Come from the north: and as I came along, I met and overtook a dozen captains, Bareheaded, sweating, knocking at the taverns, And asking everyone for Sir John Falstaff.  PRINCE. By heaven, Poins, I feel me much to blame, So idly to profane the precious time, When tempest of commotion, like the south Borne with black vapour, doth begin to melt And drop upon our bare unarmed heads. Give me my sword and cloak. Falstaff, good night.   [_Exeunt Prince, Poins, Peto and Bardolph._]  FALSTAFF. Now comes in the sweetest morsel of the night, and we must hence and leave it unpicked. [_Knocking within_.] More knocking at the door?  Enter Bardolph.  How now, what’s the matter?  BARDOLPH. You must away to court, sir, presently. A dozen captains stay at door for you.  FALSTAFF. [_To the Page_.] Pay the musicians, sirrah. Farewell, hostess; farewell, Doll. You see, my good wenches, how men of merit are sought after. The undeserver may sleep, when the man of action is called on. Farewell, good wenches. If I be not sent away post, I will see you again ere I go.  DOLL. I cannot speak; if my heart be not ready to burst—well, sweet Jack, have a care of thyself.  FALSTAFF. Farewell, farewell.   [_Exeunt Falstaff and Bardolph._]  HOSTESS. Well, fare thee well. I have known thee these twenty-nine years, come peascod-time; but an honester and truer-hearted man—well, fare thee well.  BARDOLPH. [_Within_.] Mistress Tearsheet!  HOSTESS. What’s the matter?  BARDOLPH. [_Within_.] Bid Mistress Tearsheet come to my master.  HOSTESS. O, run, Doll, run; run, good Doll; come. She comes blubbered. Yea, will you come, Doll?   [_Exeunt._]
  ACT III  SCENE I. Westminster. The palace.  Enter the King in his nightgown, with a Page.  KING. Go call the Earls of Surrey and of Warwick; But, ere they come, bid them o’er-read these letters And well consider of them. Make good speed.   [_Exit Page._]  How many thousands of my poorest subjects Are at this hour asleep! O sleep, O gentle sleep, Nature’s soft nurse, how have I frighted thee, That thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down And steep my senses in forgetfulness? Why rather, sleep, liest thou in smoky cribs, Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee, And hushed with buzzing night-flies to thy slumber, Than in the perfumed chambers of the great, Under the canopies of costly state, And lull’d with sound of sweetest melody? O thou dull god, why liest thou with the vile In loathsome beds, and leavest the kingly couch A watch-case or a common ’larum-bell? Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast Seal up the ship-boy’s eyes, and rock his brains In cradle of the rude imperious surge And in the visitation of the winds, Who take the ruffian billows by the top, Curling their monstrous heads and hanging them With deafing clamour in the slippery clouds, That with the hurly death itself awakes? Canst thou, O partial sleep, give thy repose To the wet sea-boy in an hour so rude, And in the calmest and most stillest night, With all appliances and means to boot, Deny it to a King? Then happy low, lie down! Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.  Enter Warwick and Surrey.  WARWICK. Many good morrows to your Majesty!  KING. Is it good morrow, lords?  WARWICK. ’Tis one o’clock, and past.  KING. Why then, good morrow to you all, my lords. Have you read o’er the letters that I sent you?  WARWICK. We have, my liege.  KING. Then you perceive the body of our kingdom How foul it is, what rank diseases grow, And with what danger, near the heart of it.  WARWICK. It is but as a body yet distemper’d, Which to his former strength may be restored With good advice and little medicine. My Lord Northumberland will soon be cool’d.  KING. O God, that one might read the book of fate, And see the revolution of the times Make mountains level, and the continent, Weary of solid firmness, melt itself Into the sea, and other times to see The beachy girdle of the ocean Too wide for Neptune’s hips; how chance’s mocks And changes fill the cup of alteration With divers liquors! O, if this were seen, The happiest youth, viewing his progress through, What perils past, what crosses to ensue, Would shut the book, and sit him down and die. ’Tis not ten years gone Since Richard and Northumberland, great friends, Did feast together, and in two years after Were they at wars. It is but eight years since This Percy was the man nearest my soul, Who like a brother toil’d in my affairs And laid his love and life under my foot, Yea, for my sake, even to the eyes of Richard Gave him defiance. But which of you was by— [_To Warwick_.] You, cousin Nevil, as I may remember— When Richard, with his eye brimful of tears, Then check’d and rated by Northumberland, Did speak these words, now proved a prophecy? “Northumberland, thou ladder by the which My cousin Bolingbroke ascends my throne” Though then, God knows, I had no such intent, But that necessity so bow’d the state That I and greatness were compell’d to kiss— “The time shall come,” thus did he follow it, “The time will come, that foul sin, gathering head, Shall break into corruption”—so went on, Foretelling this same time’s condition And the division of our amity.  WARWICK. There is a history in all men’s lives Figuring the natures of the times deceased; The which observed, a man may prophesy, With a near aim, of the main chance of things As yet not come to life, who in their seeds And weak beginning lie intreasured. Such things become the hatch and brood of time; And by the necessary form of this King Richard might create a perfect guess That great Northumberland, then false to him, Would of that seed grow to a greater falseness, Which should not find a ground to root upon, Unless on you.  KING. Are these things then necessities? Then let us meet them like necessities; And that same word even now cries out on us. They say the bishop and Northumberland Are fifty thousand strong.  WARWICK. It cannot be, my lord. Rumour doth double, like the voice and echo, The numbers of the feared. Please it your Grace To go to bed. Upon my soul, my lord, The powers that you already have sent forth Shall bring this prize in very easily. To comfort you the more, I have received A certain instance that Glendower is dead. Your majesty hath been this fortnight ill, And these unseason’d hours perforce must add Unto your sickness.  KING. I will take your counsel. And were these inward wars once out of hand, We would, dear lords, unto the Holy Land.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. Gloucestershire. Before Justice Shallow’s house.  Enter Shallow and Silence, meeting; Mouldy, Shadow, Wart, Feeble, Bullcalf, a Servant or two with them.  SHALLOW. Come on, come on, come on. Give me your hand, sir, give me your hand, sir. An early stirrer, by the rood! And how doth my good cousin Silence?  SILENCE. Good morrow, good cousin Shallow.  SHALLOW. And how doth my cousin, your bedfellow? And your fairest daughter and mine, my god-daughter Ellen?  SILENCE. Alas, a black ousel, cousin Shallow!  SHALLOW. By yea and no, sir, I dare say my cousin William is become a good scholar. He is at Oxford still, is he not?  SILENCE. Indeed, sir, to my cost.  SHALLOW. He must, then, to the Inns o’ Court shortly. I was once of Clement’s Inn, where I think they will talk of mad Shallow yet.  SILENCE. You were called “lusty Shallow” then, cousin.  SHALLOW. By the mass, I was called anything, and I would have done anything indeed too, and roundly too. There was I, and little John Doit of Staffordshire, and black George Barnes, and Francis Pickbone, and Will Squele, a Cotswold man. You had not four such swinge-bucklers in all the Inns o’ Court again. And I may say to you, we knew where the bona-robas were and had the best of them all at commandment. Then was Jack Falstaff, now Sir John, a boy, and page to Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk.  SILENCE. This Sir John, cousin, that comes hither anon about soldiers?  SHALLOW. The same Sir John, the very same. I see him break Scoggin’s head at the court gate, when he was a crack not thus high; and the very same day did I fight with one Sampson Stockfish, a fruiterer, behind Gray’s Inn. Jesu, Jesu, the mad days that I have spent! And to see how many of my old acquaintance are dead!  SILENCE. We shall all follow, cousin.  SHALLOW. Certain, ’tis certain, very sure, very sure. Death, as the Psalmist saith, is certain to all, all shall die. How a good yoke of bullocks at Stamford fair?  SILENCE. By my troth, I was not there.  SHALLOW. Death is certain. Is old Double of your town living yet?  SILENCE. Dead, sir.  SHALLOW. Jesu, Jesu, dead! He drew a good bow, and dead! He shot a fine shoot. John a Gaunt loved him well, and betted much money on his head. Dead! He would have clapped i’ th’ clout at twelve score, and carried you a forehand shaft a fourteen and fourteen and a half, that it would have done a man’s heart good to see. How a score of ewes now?  SILENCE. Thereafter as they be; a score of good ewes may be worth ten pounds.  SHALLOW. And is old Double dead?  SILENCE. Here come two of Sir John Falstaff’s men, as I think.  Enter Bardolph and one with him.  SHALLOW. Good morrow, honest gentlemen.  BARDOLPH. I beseech you, which is Justice Shallow?  SHALLOW. I am Robert Shallow, sir, a poor esquire of this county, and one of the King’s justices of the peace. What is your good pleasure with me?  BARDOLPH. My captain, sir, commends him to you, my captain, Sir John Falstaff, a tall gentleman, by heaven, and a most gallant leader.  SHALLOW. He greets me well, sir. I knew him a good backsword man. How doth the good knight? May I ask how my lady his wife doth?  BARDOLPH. Sir, pardon. A soldier is better accommodated than with a wife.  SHALLOW. It is well said, in faith, sir, and it is well said indeed too. “Better accommodated!” It is good, yea indeed, is it. Good phrases are surely, and ever were, very commendable. “Accommodated.” It comes of _accommodo_. Very good, a good phrase.  BARDOLPH. Pardon, sir, I have heard the word—phrase call you it? By this day, I know not the phrase, but I will maintain the word with my sword to be a soldier-like word, and a word of exceeding good command, by heaven. Accommodated, that is when a man is, as they say, accommodated, or when a man is being whereby he may be thought to be accommodated; which is an excellent thing.  SHALLOW. It is very just.  Enter Falstaff.  Look, here comes good Sir John. Give me your good hand, give me your worship’s good hand. By my troth, you like well and bear your years very well. Welcome, good Sir John.  FALSTAFF. I am glad to see you well, good Master Robert Shallow. Master Surecard, as I think?  SHALLOW. No, Sir John, it is my cousin Silence, in commission with me.  FALSTAFF. Good Master Silence, it well befits you should be of the peace.  SILENCE. Your good worship is welcome.  FALSTAFF. Fie, this is hot weather, gentlemen. Have you provided me here half a dozen sufficient men?  SHALLOW. Marry, have we, sir. Will you sit?  FALSTAFF. Let me see them, I beseech you.  SHALLOW. Where’s the roll? Where’s the roll? Where’s the roll? Let me see, let me see, let me see. So, so, so, so, so, so, so. Yea, marry, sir: Ralph Mouldy! Let them appear as I call; let them do so, let them do so. Let me see; where is Mouldy?  MOULDY. Here, an it please you.  SHALLOW. What think you, Sir John? A good-limbed fellow, young, strong, and of good friends.  FALSTAFF. Is thy name Mouldy?  MOULDY. Yea, an’t please you.  FALSTAFF. ’Tis the more time thou wert used.  SHALLOW. Ha, ha, ha! most excellent, i’ faith! Things that are mouldy lack use. Very singular good, in faith, well said, Sir John, very well said.  FALSTAFF. Prick him.  MOULDY. I was pricked well enough before, an you could have let me alone. My old dame will be undone now for one to do her husbandry and her drudgery. You need not to have pricked me, there are other men fitter to go out than I.  FALSTAFF. Go to. Peace, Mouldy; you shall go. Mouldy, it is time you were spent.  MOULDY. Spent?  SHALLOW. Peace, fellow, peace. Stand aside. Know you where you are? For th’other, Sir John. Let me see: Simon Shadow!  FALSTAFF. Yea, marry, let me have him to sit under. He’s like to be a cold soldier.  SHALLOW. Where’s Shadow?  SHADOW. Here, sir.  FALSTAFF. Shadow, whose son art thou?  SHADOW. My mother’s son, sir.  FALSTAFF. Thy mother’s son! Like enough, and thy father’s shadow. So the son of the female is the shadow of the male. It is often so indeed, but much of the father’s substance!  SHALLOW. Do you like him, Sir John?  FALSTAFF. Shadow will serve for summer. Prick him, for we have a number of shadows to fill up the muster-book.  SHALLOW. Thomas Wart!  FALSTAFF. Where’s he?  WART. Here, sir.  FALSTAFF. Is thy name Wart?  WART. Yea, sir.  FALSTAFF. Thou art a very ragged wart.  SHALLOW. Shall I prick him, Sir John?  FALSTAFF. It were superfluous, for his apparel is built upon his back, and the whole frame stands upon pins. Prick him no more.  SHALLOW. Ha, ha, ha! You can do it, sir, you can do it. I commend you well. Francis Feeble!  FEEBLE. Here, sir.  FALSTAFF. What trade art thou, Feeble?  FEEBLE. A woman’s tailor, sir.  SHALLOW. Shall I prick him, sir?  FALSTAFF. You may; but if he had been a man’s tailor, he’d ha’ pricked you. Wilt thou make as many holes in an enemy’s battle as thou hast done in a woman’s petticoat?  FEEBLE. I will do my good will, sir, you can have no more.  FALSTAFF. Well said, good woman’s tailor! Well said, courageous Feeble! Thou wilt be as valiant as the wrathful dove or most magnanimous mouse. Prick the woman’s tailor: well, Master Shallow, deep, Master Shallow.  FEEBLE. I would Wart might have gone, sir.  FALSTAFF. I would thou wert a man’s tailor, that thou mightst mend him and make him fit to go. I cannot put him to a private soldier that is the leader of so many thousands. Let that suffice, most forcible Feeble.  FEEBLE. It shall suffice, sir.  FALSTAFF. I am bound to thee, reverend Feeble. Who is next?  SHALLOW. Peter Bullcalf o’ th’ green!  FALSTAFF. Yea, marry, let’s see Bullcalf.  BULLCALF. Here, sir.  FALSTAFF. Fore God, a likely fellow! Come, prick me Bullcalf till he roar again.  BULLCALF. O Lord! good my lord captain—  FALSTAFF. What, dost thou roar before thou art pricked?  BULLCALF. O Lord, sir, I am a diseased man.  FALSTAFF. What disease hast thou?  BULLCALF. A whoreson cold, sir, a cough, sir, which I caught with ringing in the King’s affairs upon his coronation day, sir.  FALSTAFF. Come, thou shalt go to the wars in a gown; we will have away thy cold, and I will take such order that thy friends shall ring for thee. Is here all?  SHALLOW. Here is two more called than your number; you must have but four here, sir; and so, I pray you, go in with me to dinner.  FALSTAFF. Come, I will go drink with you, but I cannot tarry dinner. I am glad to see you, by my troth, Master Shallow.  SHALLOW. O, Sir John, do you remember since we lay all night in the windmill in Saint George’s Field?  FALSTAFF. No more of that, good Master Shallow, no more of that.  SHALLOW. Ha, ’twas a merry night. And is Jane Nightwork alive?  FALSTAFF. She lives, Master Shallow.  SHALLOW. She never could away with me.  FALSTAFF. Never, never; she would always say she could not abide Master Shallow.  SHALLOW. By the mass, I could anger her to th’ heart. She was then a bona-roba. Doth she hold her own well?  FALSTAFF. Old, old, Master Shallow.  SHALLOW. Nay, she must be old, she cannot choose but be old, certain she’s old, and had Robin Nightwork by old Nightwork before I came to Clement’s Inn.  SILENCE. That’s fifty-five year ago.  SHALLOW. Ha, cousin Silence, that thou hadst seen that that this knight and I have seen! Ha, Sir John, said I well?  FALSTAFF. We have heard the chimes at midnight, Master Shallow.  SHALLOW. That we have, that we have, that we have; in faith, Sir John, we have. Our watchword was “Hem boys!” Come, let’s to dinner; come, let’s to dinner. Jesus, the days that we have seen! Come, come.   [_Exeunt Falstaff, Shallow and Silence._]  BULLCALF. Good Master Corporate Bardolph, stand my friend; and here’s four Harry ten shillings in French crowns for you. In very truth, sir, I had as lief be hanged, sir, as go. And yet, for mine own part, sir, I do not care; but rather because I am unwilling, and, for mine own part, have a desire to stay with my friends; else, sir, I did not care, for mine own part, so much.  BARDOLPH. Go to, stand aside.  MOULDY. And, good Master Corporal Captain, for my old dame’s sake, stand my friend. She has nobody to do anything about her when I am gone, and she is old, and cannot help herself. You shall have forty, sir.  BARDOLPH. Go to, stand aside.  FEEBLE. By my troth, I care not. A man can die but once. We owe God a death. I’ll ne’er bear a base mind. An ’t be my destiny, so; an ’t be not, so. No man’s too good to serve’s prince, and let it go which way it will, he that dies this year is quit for the next.  BARDOLPH. Well said, th’art a good fellow.  FEEBLE. Faith, I’ll bear no base mind.  Enter Falstaff and the Justices.  FALSTAFF. Come, sir, which men shall I have?  SHALLOW. Four of which you please.  BARDOLPH. Sir, a word with you. I have three pound to free Mouldy and Bullcalf.  FALSTAFF. Go to, well.  SHALLOW. Come, Sir John, which four will you have?  FALSTAFF. Do you choose for me.  SHALLOW. Marry, then, Mouldy, Bullcalf, Feeble, and Shadow.  FALSTAFF. Mouldy and Bullcalf: for you, Mouldy, stay at home till you are past service; and for your part, Bullcalf, grow till you come unto it. I will none of you.  SHALLOW. Sir John, Sir John, do not yourself wrong. They are your likeliest men, and I would have you served with the best.  FALSTAFF. Will you tell me, Master Shallow, how to choose a man? Care I for the limb, the thews, the stature, bulk, and big assemblance of a man? Give me the spirit, Master Shallow. Here’s Wart. You see what a ragged appearance it is. He shall charge you and discharge you with the motion of a pewterer’s hammer, come off and on swifter than he that gibbets on the brewer’s bucket. And this same half-faced fellow, Shadow; give me this man. He presents no mark to the enemy. The foeman may with as great aim level at the edge of a penknife. And for a retreat, how swiftly will this Feeble, the woman’s tailor, run off! O, give me the spare men, and spare me the great ones. Put me a caliver into Wart’s hand, Bardolph.  BARDOLPH. Hold, Wart. Traverse. Thas, thas, thas.  FALSTAFF. Come, manage me your caliver. So, very well, go to, very good, exceeding good. O, give me always a little, lean, old, chopt, bald shot. Well said, i’ faith, Wart. Th’art a good scab. Hold, there’s a tester for thee.  SHALLOW. He is not his craft’s master, he doth not do it right. I remember at Mile-End Green, when I lay at Clement’s Inn—I was then Sir Dagonet in Arthur’s show—there was a little quiver fellow, and he would manage you his piece thus. And he would about and about, and come you in and come you in. “Rah, tah, tah,” would he say. “Bounce” would he say; and away again would he go, and again would he come. I shall ne’er see such a fellow.  FALSTAFF. These fellows will do well. Master Shallow. God keep you, Master Silence: I will not use many words with you. Fare you well, gentlemen both. I thank you. I must a dozen mile tonight. Bardolph, give the soldiers coats.  SHALLOW. Sir John, the Lord bless you! God prosper your affairs! God send us peace! At your return, visit our house, let our old acquaintance be renewed. Peradventure I will with ye to the court.  FALSTAFF. Fore God, I would you would, Master Shallow.  SHALLOW. Go to, I have spoke at a word. God keep you.  FALSTAFF. Fare you well, gentle gentlemen. [_Exeunt Justices_.] On, Bardolph, lead the men away. [_Exeunt Bardolph, recruits, &c._] As I return, I will fetch off these justices. I do see the bottom of Justice Shallow. Lord, Lord, how subject we old men are to this vice of lying! This same starved justice hath done nothing but prate to me of the wildness of his youth, and the feats he hath done about Turnbull Street, and every third word a lie, duer paid to the hearer than the Turk’s tribute. I do remember him at Clement’s Inn, like a man made after supper of a cheese-paring. When he was naked, he was, for all the world, like a forked radish, with a head fantastically carved upon it with a knife. He was so forlorn, that his dimensions to any thick sight were invincible. He was the very genius of famine, yet lecherous as a monkey, and the whores called him mandrake. He came ever in the rearward of the fashion, and sung those tunes to the overscutched huswives that he heard the carmen whistle, and sware they were his fancies or his good-nights. And now is this Vice’s dagger become a squire, and talks as familiarly of John a Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him, and I’ll be sworn he ne’er saw him but once in the tilt-yard, and then he burst his head for crowding among the marshal’s men. I saw it and told John a Gaunt he beat his own name, for you might have thrust him and all his apparel into an eel-skin; the case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him, a court. And now has he land and beefs. Well, I’ll be acquainted with him if I return, and ’t shall go hard but I’ll make him a philosopher’s two stones to me. If the young dace be a bait for the old pike, I see no reason in the law of nature but I may snap at him. Let time shape, and there an end.   [_Exit._]
  ACT V  SCENE I. Gloucestershire. Shallow’s house.  Enter Shallow, Falstaff, Bardolph and Page.  SHALLOW. By cock and pie, sir, you shall not away tonight. What, Davy, I say!  FALSTAFF. You must excuse me, Master Robert Shallow.  SHALLOW. I will not excuse you, you shall not be excused. Excuses shall not be admitted, there is no excuse shall serve, you shall not be excused. Why, Davy!  Enter Davy.  DAVY. Here, sir.  SHALLOW. Davy, Davy, Davy, Davy, let me see, Davy, let me see, Davy, let me see. Yea, marry, William cook, bid him come hither. Sir John, you shall not be excused.  DAVY. Marry, sir, thus: those precepts cannot be served; and again, sir—shall we sow the hade land with wheat?  SHALLOW. With red wheat, Davy. But for William cook, are there no young pigeons?  DAVY. Yes, sir. Here is now the smith’s note for shoeing and plough-irons.  SHALLOW. Let it be cast and paid. Sir John, you shall not be excused.  DAVY. Now, sir, a new link to the bucket must needs be had. And, sir, do you mean to stop any of William’s wages, about the sack he lost the other day at Hinckley fair?  SHALLOW. He shall answer it. Some pigeons, Davy, a couple of short-legged hens, a joint of mutton, and any pretty little tiny kickshaws, tell William cook.  DAVY. Doth the man of war stay all night, sir?  SHALLOW. Yea, Davy, I will use him well: a friend i’ th’ court is better than a penny in purse. Use his men well, Davy, for they are arrant knaves, and will backbite.  DAVY. No worse than they are backbitten, sir, for they have marvellous foul linen.  SHALLOW. Well conceited, Davy. About thy business, Davy.  DAVY. I beseech you, sir, to countenance William Visor of Woncot against Clement Perkes o’ th’ hill.  SHALLOW. There is many complaints, Davy, against that Visor. That Visor is an arrant knave, on my knowledge.  DAVY. I grant your worship that he is a knave, sir, but yet, God forbid, sir, but a knave should have some countenance at his friend’s request. An honest man, sir, is able to speak for himself, when a knave is not. I have served your worship truly, sir, this eight years; and if I cannot once or twice in a quarter bear out a knave against an honest man, I have but a very little credit with your worship. The knave is mine honest friend, sir; therefore I beseech your worship let him be countenanced.  SHALLOW. Go to; I say he shall have no wrong. Look about, Davy.   [_Exit Davy._]  Where are you, Sir John? Come, come, come, off with your boots. Give me your hand, Master Bardolph.  BARDOLPH. I am glad to see your worship.  SHALLOW. I thank thee with all my heart, kind Master Bardolph; and welcome, my tall fellow [_to the Page_]. Come, Sir John.  FALSTAFF. I’ll follow you, good Master Robert Shallow.   [_Exit Shallow._]  Bardolph, look to our horses.   [_Exeunt Bardolph and Page._]  If I were sawed into quantities, I should make four dozen of such bearded hermits’ staves as Master Shallow. It is a wonderful thing to see the semblable coherence of his men’s spirits and his. They, by observing of him, do bear themselves like foolish justices: he, by conversing with them, is turned into a justice-like serving-man. Their spirits are so married in conjunction with the participation of society that they flock together in consent, like so many wild-geese. If I had a suit to Master Shallow, I would humour his men with the imputation of being near their master: if to his men, I would curry with Master Shallow that no man could better command his servants. It is certain that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is caught, as men take diseases, one of another. Therefore let men take heed of their company. I will devise matter enough out of this Shallow to keep Prince Harry in continual laughter the wearing out of six fashions, which is four terms, or two actions, and he shall laugh without intervallums. O, it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never had the ache in his shoulders! O, you shall see him laugh till his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up!  SHALLOW. [_Within_.] Sir John!  FALSTAFF. I come, Master Shallow, I come, Master Shallow.   [_Exit._]  SCENE II. Westminster. The palace.  Enter Warwick and the Lord Chief Justice, meeting.  WARWICK. How now, my Lord Chief Justice, whither away?  CHIEF JUSTICE. How doth the King?  WARWICK. Exceeding well. His cares are now all ended.  CHIEF JUSTICE. I hope, not dead.  WARWICK. He’s walk’d the way of nature, And to our purposes he lives no more.  CHIEF JUSTICE. I would his Majesty had call’d me with him. The service that I truly did his life Hath left me open to all injuries.  WARWICK. Indeed I think the young King loves you not.  CHIEF JUSTICE. I know he doth not, and do arm myself To welcome the condition of the time, Which cannot look more hideously upon me Than I have drawn it in my fantasy.  Enter Lancaster, Clarence, Gloucester and others.  WARWICK. Here comes the heavy issue of dead Harry. O that the living Harry had the temper Of he the worst of these three gentlemen! How many nobles then should hold their places, That must strike sail to spirits of vile sort!  CHIEF JUSTICE. O God, I fear all will be overturn’d.  LANCASTER. Good morrow, cousin Warwick, good morrow.  GLOUCESTER & CLARENCE. Good morrow, cousin.  LANCASTER. We meet like men that had forgot to speak.  WARWICK. We do remember, but our argument Is all too heavy to admit much talk.  LANCASTER. Well, peace be with him that hath made us heavy!  CHIEF JUSTICE. Peace be with us, lest we be heavier!  GLOUCESTER. O, good my lord, you have lost a friend indeed; And I dare swear you borrow not that face Of seeming sorrow; it is sure your own.  LANCASTER. Though no man be assured what grace to find, You stand in coldest expectation. I am the sorrier; would ’twere otherwise.  CLARENCE. Well, you must now speak Sir John Falstaff fair, Which swims against your stream of quality.  CHIEF JUSTICE. Sweet Princes, what I did I did in honour, Led by th’ impartial conduct of my soul; And never shall you see that I will beg A ragged and forestall’d remission. If truth and upright innocency fail me, I’ll to the King my master that is dead, And tell him who hath sent me after him.  WARWICK. Here comes the Prince.  Enter King Henry the Fifth, attended.  CHIEF JUSTICE. Good morrow, and God save your Majesty!  KING. This new and gorgeous garment, majesty, Sits not so easy on me as you think. Brothers, you mix your sadness with some fear. This is the English, not the Turkish court; Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds, But Harry Harry. Yet be sad, good brothers, For, by my faith, it very well becomes you. Sorrow so royally in you appears That I will deeply put the fashion on And wear it in my heart. Why then, be sad; But entertain no more of it, good brothers, Than a joint burden laid upon us all. For me, by heaven, I bid you be assured, I’ll be your father and your brother too; Let me but bear your love, I’ll bear your cares. Yet weep that Harry’s dead, and so will I; But Harry lives, that shall convert those tears By number into hours of happiness.  PRINCES. We hope no otherwise from your Majesty.  KING. You all look strangely on me. And you most; You are, I think, assured I love you not.  CHIEF JUSTICE. I am assured, if I be measured rightly, Your Majesty hath no just cause to hate me.  KING. No? How might a prince of my great hopes forget So great indignities you laid upon me? What! rate, rebuke, and roughly send to prison Th’ immediate heir of England? Was this easy? May this be wash’d in Lethe and forgotten?  CHIEF JUSTICE. I then did use the person of your father; The image of his power lay then in me; And in the administration of his law, Whiles I was busy for the commonwealth, Your Highness pleased to forget my place, The majesty and power of law and justice, The image of the King whom I presented, And struck me in my very seat of judgement; Whereon, as an offender to your father, I gave bold way to my authority And did commit you. If the deed were ill, Be you contented, wearing now the garland, To have a son set your decrees at nought? To pluck down justice from your awful bench? To trip the course of law and blunt the sword That guards the peace and safety of your person? Nay more, to spurn at your most royal image, And mock your workings in a second body? Question your royal thoughts, make the case yours; Be now the father and propose a son, Hear your own dignity so much profaned, See your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted, Behold yourself so by a son disdain’d, And then imagine me taking your part And in your power soft silencing your son. After this cold considerance, sentence me; And, as you are a king, speak in your state What I have done that misbecame my place, My person, or my liege’s sovereignty.  KING. You are right, justice, and you weigh this well. Therefore still bear the balance and the sword. And I do wish your honours may increase Till you do live to see a son of mine Offend you and obey you, as I did. So shall I live to speak my father’s words: “Happy am I, that have a man so bold That dares do justice on my proper son; And not less happy, having such a son That would deliver up his greatness so Into the hands of justice.” You did commit me, For which I do commit into your hand Th’ unstained sword that you have used to bear, With this remembrance: that you use the same With the like bold, just, and impartial spirit As you have done ’gainst me. There is my hand. You shall be as a father to my youth, My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear, And I will stoop and humble my intents To your well-practised wise directions. And, princes all, believe me, I beseech you, My father is gone wild into his grave, For in his tomb lie my affections; And with his spirit sadly I survive To mock the expectation of the world, To frustrate prophecies, and to raze out Rotten opinion, who hath writ me down After my seeming. The tide of blood in me Hath proudly flow’d in vanity till now. Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea, Where it shall mingle with the state of floods, And flow henceforth in formal majesty. Now call we our high court of parliament, And let us choose such limbs of noble counsel That the great body of our state may go In equal rank with the best-govern’d nation; That war, or peace, or both at once, may be As things acquainted and familiar to us; In which you, father, shall have foremost hand. Our coronation done, we will accite, As I before remember’d, all our state: And, God consigning to my good intents, No prince nor peer shall have just cause to say, God shorten Harry’s happy life one day!   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. Gloucestershire. Shallow’s orchard.  Enter Falstaff, Shallow, Silence, Davy, Bardolph and the Page.  SHALLOW. Nay, you shall see my orchard, where, in an arbour, we will eat a last year’s pippin of mine own graffing, with a dish of caraways, and so forth. Come, cousin Silence. And then to bed.  FALSTAFF. Fore God, you have here a goodly dwelling, and a rich.  SHALLOW. Barren, barren, barren; beggars all, beggars all, Sir John. Marry, good air. Spread, Davy, spread, Davy. Well said, Davy.  FALSTAFF. This Davy serves you for good uses; he is your serving-man and your husband.  SHALLOW. A good varlet, a good varlet, a very good varlet, Sir John. By the mass, I have drunk too much sack at supper. A good varlet. Now sit down, now sit down. Come, cousin.  SILENCE. Ah, sirrah! quoth-a, we shall [_Singing._]      _Do nothing but eat, and make good cheer,     And praise God for the merry year,     When flesh is cheap and females dear,     And lusty lads roam here and there     So merrily,     And ever among so merrily._  FALSTAFF. There’s a merry heart! Good Master Silence, I’ll give you a health for that anon.  SHALLOW. Give Master Bardolph some wine, Davy.  DAVY. Sweet sir, sit. I’ll be with you anon. Most sweet sir, sit. Master page, good master page, sit. Proface! What you want in meat, we’ll have in drink, but you must bear; the heart’s all.   [_Exit._]  SHALLOW. Be merry, Master Bardolph, and, my little soldier there, be merry.  SILENCE. [_Singing._]      _Be merry, be merry, my wife has all,     For women are shrews, both short and tall.     ’Tis merry in hall when beards wag all,     And welcome merry Shrove-tide.     Be merry, be merry._  FALSTAFF. I did not think Master Silence had been a man of this mettle.  SILENCE. Who, I? I have been merry twice and once ere now.  Enter Davy.  DAVY. [_To Bardolph_.] There’s a dish of leather-coats for you.  SHALLOW. Davy!  DAVY. Your worship? I’ll be with you straight. [_To Bardolph_] A cup of wine, sir?  SILENCE. [_Singing._]      _A cup of wine that’s brisk and fine,     And drink unto thee, leman mine,     And a merry heart lives long-a._  FALSTAFF. Well said, Master Silence.  SILENCE. An we shall be merry, now comes in the sweet o’ th’ night.  FALSTAFF. Health and long life to you, Master Silence.  SILENCE. [_Singing._]      _Fill the cup, and let it come,     I’ll pledge you a mile to th’ bottom._  SHALLOW. Honest Bardolph, welcome! If thou want’st anything and wilt not call, beshrew thy heart. Welcome, my little tiny thief, [_to the Page_] and welcome indeed too. I’ll drink to Master Bardolph, and to all the cabileros about London.  DAVY. I hope to see London once ere I die.  BARDOLPH. An I might see you there, Davy,—  SHALLOW. By the mass, you’ll crack a quart together, ha! will you not, Master Bardolph?  BARDOLPH. Yea, sir, in a pottle-pot.  SHALLOW. By God’s liggens, I thank thee. The knave will stick by thee, I can assure thee that. He will not out, he. ’Tis true bred.  BARDOLPH. And I’ll stick by him, sir.  SHALLOW. Why, there spoke a king. Lack nothing! Be merry.   [_Knocking within._]  Look who’s at door there, ho! Who knocks?   [_Exit Davy._]  FALSTAFF. [_To Silence, seeing him take off a bumper_.] Why, now you have done me right.  SILENCE. [_Singing._]      _Do me right,     And dub me knight:     Samingo._  Is’t not so?  FALSTAFF. ’Tis so.  SILENCE. Is’t so? Why then, say an old man can do somewhat.  Enter Davy.  DAVY. An’t please your worship, there’s one Pistol come from the court with news.  FALSTAFF. From the court? Let him come in.  Enter Pistol.  How now, Pistol?  PISTOL. Sir John, God save you!  FALSTAFF. What wind blew you hither, Pistol?  PISTOL. Not the ill wind which blows no man to good. Sweet knight, thou art now one of the greatest men in this realm.  SILENCE. By’r lady, I think he be, but goodman Puff of Barson.  PISTOL. Puff! Puff in thy teeth, most recreant coward base! Sir John, I am thy Pistol and thy friend, And helter-skelter have I rode to thee, And tidings do I bring and lucky joys, And golden times, and happy news of price.  FALSTAFF. I pray thee now, deliver them like a man of this world.  PISTOL. A foutre for the world and worldlings base! I speak of Africa and golden joys.  FALSTAFF. O base Assyrian knight, what is thy news? Let King Cophetua know the truth thereof.  SILENCE. [_Singing_.] _And Robin Hood, Scarlet, and John._  PISTOL. Shall dunghill curs confront the Helicons? And shall good news be baffled? Then, Pistol, lay thy head in Furies’ lap.  SHALLOW. Honest gentleman, I know not your breeding.  PISTOL. Why then, lament therefor.  SHALLOW. Give me pardon, sir. If, sir, you come with news from the court, I take it there’s but two ways, either to utter them, or conceal them. I am, sir, under the King, in some authority.  PISTOL. Under which king, Besonian? Speak, or die.  SHALLOW. Under King Harry.  PISTOL. Harry the Fourth, or Fifth?  SHALLOW. Harry the Fourth.  PISTOL. A foutre for thine office! Sir John, thy tender lambkin now is King; Harry the Fifth’s the man. I speak the truth. When Pistol lies, do this, and fig me, like The bragging Spaniard.  FALSTAFF. What, is the old King dead?  PISTOL. As nail in door. The things I speak are just.  FALSTAFF. Away, Bardolph, saddle my horse. Master Robert Shallow, choose what office thou wilt in the land, ’tis thine. Pistol, I will double-charge thee with dignities.  BARDOLPH. O joyful day! I would not take a knighthood for my fortune.  PISTOL. What! I do bring good news.  FALSTAFF. Carry Master Silence to bed. Master Shallow, my Lord Shallow, be what thou wilt; I am Fortune’s steward! Get on thy boots, we’ll ride all night. O sweet Pistol! Away, Bardolph!   [_Exit Bardolph._]  Come, Pistol, utter more to me; and withal devise something to do thyself good. Boot, boot, Master Shallow. I know the young King is sick for me. Let us take any man’s horses. The laws of England are at my commandment. Blessed are they that have been my friends, and woe to my Lord Chief Justice!  PISTOL. Let vultures vile seize on his lungs also! “Where is the life that late I led?” say they: Why, here it is; welcome these pleasant days!   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IV. London. A street.  Enter Beadles, dragging in Hostess Quickly and Doll Tearsheet.  HOSTESS. No, thou arrant knave. I would to God that I might die, that I might have thee hanged. Thou hast drawn my shoulder out of joint.  FIRST BEADLE. The constables have delivered her over to me, and she shall have whipping-cheer enough, I warrant her. There hath been a man or two lately killed about her.  DOLL. Nut-hook, nut-hook, you lie! Come on, I’ll tell thee what, thou damned tripe-visaged rascal, an the child I now go with do miscarry, thou wert better thou hadst struck thy mother, thou paper-faced villain.  HOSTESS. O the Lord, that Sir John were come! He would make this a bloody day to somebody. But I pray God the fruit of her womb miscarry!  FIRST BEADLE. If it do, you shall have a dozen of cushions again; you have but eleven now. Come, I charge you both go with me, for the man is dead that you and Pistol beat amongst you.  DOLL. I’ll tell you what, you thin man in a censer, I will have you as soundly swinged for this, you bluebottle rogue, you filthy famished correctioner, if you be not swinged, I’ll forswear half-kirtles.  FIRST BEADLE. Come, come, you she knight-errant, come.  HOSTESS. O God, that right should thus overcome might! Well, of sufferance comes ease.  DOLL. Come, you rogue, come, bring me to a justice.  HOSTESS. Ay, come, you starved bloodhound.  DOLL. Goodman death, goodman bones!  HOSTESS. Thou atomy, thou!  DOLL. Come, you thin thing, come, you rascal!  FIRST BEADLE. Very well.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE V. A public place near Westminster Abbey.  Enter two Grooms, strewing rushes.  FIRST GROOM. More rushes, more rushes.  SECOND GROOM. The trumpets have sounded twice.  FIRST GROOM. ’Twill be two o’clock ere they come from the coronation. Dispatch, dispatch.   [_Exeunt._]  Trumpets sound, and the King and his train pass over the stage. Enter Falstaff, Shallow, Pistol, Bardolph and Page.  FALSTAFF. Stand here by me, Master Robert Shallow. I will make the King do you grace. I will leer upon him as he comes by, and do but mark the countenance that he will give me.  PISTOL. God bless thy lungs, good knight!  FALSTAFF. Come here, Pistol, stand behind me. O, if I had had time to have made new liveries, I would have bestowed the thousand pound I borrowed of you. But ’tis no matter, this poor show doth better. This doth infer the zeal I had to see him.  SHALLOW. It doth so.  FALSTAFF. It shows my earnestness of affection—  SHALLOW. It doth so.  FALSTAFF. My devotion—  SHALLOW. It doth, it doth, it doth.  FALSTAFF. As it were, to ride day and night, and not to deliberate, not to remember, not to have patience to shift me—  SHALLOW. It is best, certain.  FALSTAFF. But to stand stained with travel, and sweating with desire to see him, thinking of nothing else, putting all affairs else in oblivion, as if there were nothing else to be done but to see him.  PISTOL. ’Tis _semper idem_, for _obsque hoc nihil est;_ ’tis all in every part.  SHALLOW. ’Tis so, indeed.  PISTOL. My knight, I will inflame thy noble liver, And make thee rage. Thy Doll, and Helen of thy noble thoughts, Is in base durance and contagious prison, Haled thither By most mechanical and dirty hand. Rouse up revenge from ebon den with fell Alecto’s snake, For Doll is in. Pistol speaks nought but truth.  FALSTAFF. I will deliver her.   [_Shouts within. The trumpets sound._]  PISTOL. There roar’d the sea, and trumpet-clangor sounds.  Enter the King and his train, the Lord Chief Justice among them.  FALSTAFF. God save thy Grace, King Hal, my royal Hal!  PISTOL. The heavens thee guard and keep, most royal imp of fame!  FALSTAFF. God save thee, my sweet boy!  KING. My Lord Chief Justice, speak to that vain man.  CHIEF JUSTICE. Have you your wits? Know you what ’tis you speak?  FALSTAFF. My King! My Jove! I speak to thee, my heart!  KING. I know thee not, old man. Fall to thy prayers. How ill white hairs becomes a fool and jester! I have long dreamt of such a kind of man, So surfeit-swell’d, so old, and so profane; But, being awaked, I do despise my dream. Make less thy body hence, and more thy grace; Leave gormandizing; know the grave doth gape For thee thrice wider than for other men. Reply not to me with a fool-born jest. Presume not that I am the thing I was; For God doth know, so shall the world perceive, That I have turn’d away my former self; So will I those that kept me company. When thou dost hear I am as I have been, Approach me, and thou shalt be as thou wast, The tutor and the feeder of my riots. Till then I banish thee, on pain of death, As I have done the rest of my misleaders, Not to come near our person by ten mile. For competence of life I will allow you, That lack of means enforce you not to evils. And, as we hear you do reform yourselves, We will, according to your strengths and qualities, Give you advancement. Be it your charge, my lord, To see perform’d the tenor of our word. Set on.   [_Exeunt King with his train._]  FALSTAFF. Master Shallow, I owe you a thousand pounds.  SHALLOW. Yea, marry, Sir John, which I beseech you to let me have home with me.  FALSTAFF. That can hardly be, Master Shallow. Do not you grieve at this; I shall be sent for in private to him. Look you, he must seem thus to the world. Fear not your advancements; I will be the man yet that shall make you great.  SHALLOW. I cannot perceive how, unless you give me your doublet and stuff me out with straw. I beseech you, good Sir John, let me have five hundred of my thousand.  FALSTAFF. Sir, I will be as good as my word. This that you heard was but a colour.  SHALLOW. A colour that I fear you will die in, Sir John.  FALSTAFF. Fear no colours. Go with me to dinner. Come, Lieutenant Pistol; come, Bardolph. I shall be sent for soon at night.  Enter the Lord Chief Justice and Prince John, Officers with them.  CHIEF JUSTICE. Go, carry Sir John Falstaff to the Fleet. Take all his company along with him.  FALSTAFF. My lord, my lord,—  CHIEF JUSTICE. I cannot now speak. I will hear you soon. Take them away.  PISTOL. _Si fortuna me tormenta, spero me contenta._   [_Exeunt all but Prince John and the Lord Chief Justice._]  LANCASTER. I like this fair proceeding of the King’s. He hath intent his wonted followers Shall all be very well provided for, But all are banish’d till their conversations Appear more wise and modest to the world.  CHIEF JUSTICE. And so they are.  LANCASTER. The King hath call’d his parliament, my lord.  CHIEF JUSTICE. He hath.  LANCASTER. I will lay odds that, ere this year expire, We bear our civil swords and native fire As far as France. I heard a bird so sing, Whose music, to my thinking, pleased the King. Come, will you hence?   [_Exeunt._]
  EPILOGUE.
First my fear; then my curtsy; last my speech. My fear is your displeasure; my curtsy, my duty; and my speech, to beg your pardons. If you look for a good speech now, you undo me, for what I have to say is of mine own making; and what indeed I should say will, I doubt, prove mine own marring. But to the purpose, and so to the venture. Be it known to you, as it is very well, I was lately here in the end of a displeasing play, to pray your patience for it and to promise you a better. I meant indeed to pay you with this; which, if like an ill venture it come unluckily home, I break, and you, my gentle creditors, lose. Here I promised you I would be, and here I commit my body to your mercies. Bate me some, and I will pay you some, and, as most debtors do, promise you infinitely.  If my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me, will you command me to use my legs? And yet that were but light payment, to dance out of your debt. But a good conscience will make any possible satisfaction, and so would I. All the gentlewomen here have forgiven me; if the gentlemen will not, then the gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen, which was never seen before in such an assembly.  One word more, I beseech you. If you be not too much cloyed with fat meat, our humble author will continue the story, with Sir John in it, and make you merry with fair Katharine of France; where, for anything I know, Falstaff shall die of a sweat, unless already he be killed with your hard opinions; for Oldcastle died a martyr, and this is not the man. My tongue is weary; when my legs are too, I will bid you good night.

  PROLOGUE.   Enter Chorus.  CHORUS. O for a Muse of fire, that would ascend The brightest heaven of invention, A kingdom for a stage, princes to act, And monarchs to behold the swelling scene! Then should the warlike Harry, like himself, Assume the port of Mars, and at his heels, Leash’d in like hounds, should famine, sword, and fire Crouch for employment. But pardon, gentles all, The flat unraised spirits that hath dar’d On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth So great an object. Can this cockpit hold The vasty fields of France? Or may we cram Within this wooden O the very casques That did affright the air at Agincourt? O pardon! since a crooked figure may Attest in little place a million, And let us, ciphers to this great accompt, On your imaginary forces work. Suppose within the girdle of these walls Are now confin’d two mighty monarchies, Whose high upreared and abutting fronts The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder; Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts. Into a thousand parts divide one man, And make imaginary puissance. Think, when we talk of horses, that you see them Printing their proud hoofs i’ th’ receiving earth. For ’tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings, Carry them here and there, jumping o’er times, Turning the accomplishment of many years Into an hour-glass: for the which supply, Admit me Chorus to this history; Who prologue-like your humble patience pray, Gently to hear, kindly to judge, our play.   [_Exit._]
  ACT I  SCENE I. London. An ante-chamber in the King’s palace.
 Enter the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of Ely.  CANTERBURY. My lord, I’ll tell you, that self bill is urg’d Which in the eleventh year of the last king’s reign Was like, and had indeed against us passed But that the scambling and unquiet time Did push it out of farther question.  ELY. But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?  CANTERBURY. It must be thought on. If it pass against us, We lose the better half of our possession: For all the temporal lands, which men devout By testament have given to the Church, Would they strip from us; being valu’d thus: As much as would maintain, to the King’s honour, Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights, Six thousand and two hundred good esquires; And, to relief of lazars and weak age, Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil, A hundred almshouses right well supplied; And to the coffers of the King beside, A thousand pounds by th’ year. Thus runs the bill.  ELY. This would drink deep.  CANTERBURY. ’Twould drink the cup and all.  ELY. But what prevention?  CANTERBURY. The King is full of grace and fair regard.  ELY. And a true lover of the holy Church.  CANTERBURY. The courses of his youth promis’d it not. The breath no sooner left his father’s body But that his wildness, mortified in him, Seemed to die too; yea, at that very moment Consideration like an angel came And whipped th’ offending Adam out of him, Leaving his body as a paradise T’ envelope and contain celestial spirits. Never was such a sudden scholar made, Never came reformation in a flood With such a heady currance scouring faults, Nor never Hydra-headed wilfulness So soon did lose his seat, and all at once, As in this king.  ELY. We are blessed in the change.  CANTERBURY. Hear him but reason in divinity And, all-admiring, with an inward wish You would desire the King were made a prelate; Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs, You would say it hath been all in all his study; List his discourse of war, and you shall hear A fearful battle rendered you in music; Turn him to any cause of policy, The Gordian knot of it he will unloose, Familiar as his garter; that, when he speaks, The air, a chartered libertine, is still, And the mute wonder lurketh in men’s ears To steal his sweet and honeyed sentences; So that the art and practic part of life Must be the mistress to this theoric: Which is a wonder how his Grace should glean it, Since his addiction was to courses vain, His companies unlettered, rude, and shallow, His hours filled up with riots, banquets, sports, And never noted in him any study, Any retirement, any sequestration From open haunts and popularity.  ELY. The strawberry grows underneath the nettle, And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best Neighboured by fruit of baser quality; And so the Prince obscured his contemplation Under the veil of wildness, which, no doubt, Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night, Unseen, yet crescive in his faculty.  CANTERBURY. It must be so, for miracles are ceased, And therefore we must needs admit the means How things are perfected.  ELY. But, my good lord, How now for mitigation of this bill Urged by the Commons? Doth his Majesty Incline to it, or no?  CANTERBURY. He seems indifferent, Or rather swaying more upon our part Than cherishing th’ exhibitors against us; For I have made an offer to his Majesty, Upon our spiritual convocation And in regard of causes now in hand, Which I have opened to his Grace at large, As touching France, to give a greater sum Than ever at one time the clergy yet Did to his predecessors part withal.  ELY. How did this offer seem received, my lord?  CANTERBURY. With good acceptance of his Majesty; Save that there was not time enough to hear, As I perceived his Grace would fain have done, The severals and unhidden passages Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms, And generally to the crown and seat of France, Derived from Edward, his great-grandfather.  ELY. What was th’ impediment that broke this off?  CANTERBURY. The French ambassador upon that instant Craved audience; and the hour, I think, is come To give him hearing. Is it four o’clock?  ELY. It is.  CANTERBURY. Then go we in, to know his embassy, Which I could with a ready guess declare Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.  ELY. I’ll wait upon you, and I long to hear it.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. The same. The presence chamber.   Enter King Henry, Gloucester, Bedford, Clarence, Warwick, Westmorland,  Exeter and Attendants.  KING HENRY. Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?  EXETER. Not here in presence.  KING HENRY. Send for him, good uncle.  WESTMORLAND. Shall we call in th’ ambassador, my liege?  KING HENRY. Not yet, my cousin. We would be resolved, Before we hear him, of some things of weight That task our thoughts concerning us and France.   Enter the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of Ely.  CANTERBURY. God and his angels guard your sacred throne And make you long become it!  KING HENRY. Sure, we thank you. My learned lord, we pray you to proceed And justly and religiously unfold Why the law Salic that they have in France Or should or should not bar us in our claim. And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord, That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading, Or nicely charge your understanding soul With opening titles miscreate, whose right Suits not in native colours with the truth; For God doth know how many now in health Shall drop their blood in approbation Of what your reverence shall incite us to. Therefore take heed how you impawn our person, How you awake our sleeping sword of war. We charge you in the name of God, take heed; For never two such kingdoms did contend Without much fall of blood, whose guiltless drops Are every one a woe, a sore complaint ’Gainst him whose wrongs gives edge unto the swords That makes such waste in brief mortality. Under this conjuration speak, my lord, For we will hear, note, and believe in heart That what you speak is in your conscience washed As pure as sin with baptism.  CANTERBURY. Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers, That owe yourselves, your lives, and services To this imperial throne. There is no bar To make against your Highness’ claim to France But this, which they produce from Pharamond: _In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant_, “No woman shall succeed in Salic land;” Which Salic land the French unjustly gloze To be the realm of France, and Pharamond The founder of this law and female bar. Yet their own authors faithfully affirm That the land Salic is in Germany, Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe; Where Charles the Great, having subdu’d the Saxons, There left behind and settled certain French; Who, holding in disdain the German women For some dishonest manners of their life, Establish’d then this law, to wit, no female Should be inheritrix in Salic land; Which Salic, as I said, ’twixt Elbe and Sala, Is at this day in Germany call’d Meissen. Then doth it well appear the Salic law Was not devised for the realm of France; Nor did the French possess the Salic land Until four hundred one and twenty years After defunction of King Pharamond, Idly suppos’d the founder of this law, Who died within the year of our redemption Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great Subdu’d the Saxons, and did seat the French Beyond the river Sala, in the year Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say, King Pepin, which deposed Childeric, Did, as heir general, being descended Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair, Make claim and title to the crown of France. Hugh Capet also, who usurp’d the crown Of Charles the Duke of Lorraine, sole heir male Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great, To find his title with some shows of truth, Though, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught, Convey’d himself as the heir to the Lady Lingare, Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son To Lewis the Emperor, and Lewis the son Of Charles the Great. Also, King Lewis the Tenth, Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet, Could not keep quiet in his conscience, Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother, Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare, Daughter to Charles, the foresaid Duke of Lorraine; By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great Was re-united to the crown of France. So that, as clear as is the summer’s sun, King Pepin’s title and Hugh Capet’s claim, King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear To hold in right and title of the female. So do the kings of France unto this day, Howbeit they would hold up this Salic law To bar your Highness claiming from the female, And rather choose to hide them in a net Than amply to imbar their crooked titles Usurp’d from you and your progenitors.  KING HENRY. May I with right and conscience make this claim?  CANTERBURY. The sin upon my head, dread sovereign! For in the Book of Numbers is it writ, “When the man dies, let the inheritance Descend unto the daughter.” Gracious lord, Stand for your own! Unwind your bloody flag! Look back into your mighty ancestors! Go, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire’s tomb, From whom you claim; invoke his warlike spirit, And your great-uncle’s, Edward the Black Prince, Who on the French ground play’d a tragedy, Making defeat on the full power of France, Whiles his most mighty father on a hill Stood smiling to behold his lion’s whelp Forage in blood of French nobility. O noble English, that could entertain With half their forces the full pride of France And let another half stand laughing by, All out of work and cold for action!  ELY. Awake remembrance of these valiant dead, And with your puissant arm renew their feats. You are their heir; you sit upon their throne; The blood and courage that renowned them Runs in your veins; and my thrice-puissant liege Is in the very May-morn of his youth, Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises.  EXETER. Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth Do all expect that you should rouse yourself, As did the former lions of your blood.  WESTMORLAND. They know your Grace hath cause and means and might; So hath your Highness. Never King of England Had nobles richer, and more loyal subjects, Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England And lie pavilion’d in the fields of France.  CANTERBURY. O, let their bodies follow, my dear liege, With blood and sword and fire to win your right; In aid whereof we of the spiritualty Will raise your Highness such a mighty sum As never did the clergy at one time Bring in to any of your ancestors.  KING HENRY. We must not only arm to invade the French, But lay down our proportions to defend Against the Scot, who will make road upon us With all advantages.  CANTERBURY. They of those marches, gracious sovereign, Shall be a wall sufficient to defend Our inland from the pilfering borderers.  KING HENRY. We do not mean the coursing snatchers only, But fear the main intendment of the Scot, Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us; For you shall read that my great-grandfather Never went with his forces into France But that the Scot on his unfurnish’d kingdom Came pouring, like the tide into a breach, With ample and brim fullness of his force, Galling the gleaned land with hot assays, Girdling with grievous siege castles and towns; That England, being empty of defence, Hath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood.  CANTERBURY. She hath been then more fear’d than harm’d, my liege; For hear her but exampl’d by herself: When all her chivalry hath been in France, And she a mourning widow of her nobles, She hath herself not only well defended But taken and impounded as a stray The King of Scots; whom she did send to France To fill King Edward’s fame with prisoner kings, And make her chronicle as rich with praise As is the ooze and bottom of the sea With sunken wreck and sumless treasuries.  WESTMORLAND. But there’s a saying very old and true, “If that you will France win, Then with Scotland first begin.” For once the eagle England being in prey, To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs, Playing the mouse in absence of the cat, To tear and havoc more than she can eat.  EXETER. It follows then the cat must stay at home; Yet that is but a crush’d necessity, Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries, And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves. While that the armed hand doth fight abroad, The advised head defends itself at home; For government, though high and low and lower, Put into parts, doth keep in one consent, Congreeing in a full and natural close, Like music.  CANTERBURY. Therefore doth heaven divide The state of man in divers functions, Setting endeavour in continual motion, To which is fixed, as an aim or butt, Obedience; for so work the honey-bees, Creatures that by a rule in nature teach The act of order to a peopled kingdom. They have a king and officers of sorts, Where some, like magistrates, correct at home, Others like merchants, venture trade abroad, Others, like soldiers, armed in their stings, Make boot upon the summer’s velvet buds, Which pillage they with merry march bring home To the tent-royal of their emperor; Who, busied in his majesty, surveys The singing masons building roofs of gold, The civil citizens kneading up the honey, The poor mechanic porters crowding in Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate, The sad-eyed justice, with his surly hum, Delivering o’er to executors pale The lazy yawning drone. I this infer, That many things, having full reference To one consent, may work contrariously. As many arrows, loosed several ways, Come to one mark; as many ways meet in one town; As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea; As many lines close in the dial’s centre; So many a thousand actions, once afoot, End in one purpose, and be all well borne Without defeat. Therefore to France, my liege! Divide your happy England into four, Whereof take you one quarter into France, And you withal shall make all Gallia shake. If we, with thrice such powers left at home, Cannot defend our own doors from the dog, Let us be worried and our nation lose The name of hardiness and policy.  KING HENRY. Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin.   [_Exeunt some Attendants._]  Now are we well resolv’d; and, by God’s help, And yours, the noble sinews of our power, France being ours, we’ll bend it to our awe, Or break it all to pieces. Or there we’ll sit, Ruling in large and ample empery O’er France and all her almost kingly dukedoms, Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn, Tombless, with no remembrance over them. Either our history shall with full mouth Speak freely of our acts, or else our grave, Like Turkish mute, shall have a tongueless mouth, Not worshipp’d with a waxen epitaph.   Enter Ambassadors of France.  Now are we well prepar’d to know the pleasure Of our fair cousin Dauphin; for we hear Your greeting is from him, not from the King.  FIRST AMBASSADOR. May’t please your Majesty to give us leave Freely to render what we have in charge, Or shall we sparingly show you far off The Dauphin’s meaning and our embassy?  KING HENRY. We are no tyrant, but a Christian king, Unto whose grace our passion is as subject As is our wretches fett’red in our prisons; Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness Tell us the Dauphin’s mind.  AMBASSADOR. Thus, then, in few. Your Highness, lately sending into France, Did claim some certain dukedoms, in the right Of your great predecessor, King Edward the Third. In answer of which claim, the prince our master Says that you savour too much of your youth, And bids you be advis’d there’s nought in France That can be with a nimble galliard won. You cannot revel into dukedoms there. He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit, This tun of treasure; and, in lieu of this, Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim Hear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks.  KING HENRY. What treasure, uncle?  EXETER. Tennis-balls, my liege.  KING HENRY. We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us. His present and your pains we thank you for. When we have match’d our rackets to these balls, We will, in France, by God’s grace, play a set Shall strike his father’s crown into the hazard. Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler That all the courts of France will be disturb’d With chaces. And we understand him well, How he comes o’er us with our wilder days, Not measuring what use we made of them. We never valu’d this poor seat of England; And therefore, living hence, did give ourself To barbarous licence; as ’tis ever common That men are merriest when they are from home. But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state, Be like a king, and show my sail of greatness When I do rouse me in my throne of France. For that I have laid by my majesty And plodded like a man for working days, But I will rise there with so full a glory That I will dazzle all the eyes of France, Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us. And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his Hath turn’d his balls to gun-stones, and his soul Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance That shall fly with them; for many a thousand widows Shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands, Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down; And some are yet ungotten and unborn That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin’s scorn. But this lies all within the will of God, To whom I do appeal; and in whose name Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on To venge me as I may, and to put forth My rightful hand in a well-hallow’d cause. So get you hence in peace; and tell the Dauphin His jest will savour but of shallow wit, When thousands weep more than did laugh at it.— Convey them with safe conduct.—Fare you well.   [_Exeunt Ambassadors._]  EXETER. This was a merry message.  KING HENRY. We hope to make the sender blush at it. Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hour That may give furtherance to our expedition; For we have now no thought in us but France, Save those to God, that run before our business. Therefore, let our proportions for these wars Be soon collected, and all things thought upon That may with reasonable swiftness add More feathers to our wings; for, God before, We’ll chide this Dauphin at his father’s door. Therefore let every man now task his thought, That this fair action may on foot be brought.   [_Exeunt._]

  ACT V
 Enter Chorus.  CHORUS. Vouchsafe to those that have not read the story, That I may prompt them; and of such as have, I humbly pray them to admit the excuse Of time, of numbers, and due course of things, Which cannot in their huge and proper life Be here presented. Now we bear the King Toward Calais; grant him there; there seen, Heave him away upon your winged thoughts Athwart the sea. Behold, the English beach Pales in the flood with men, with wives and boys, Whose shouts and claps out-voice the deep-mouth’d sea, Which like a mighty whiffler ’fore the King Seems to prepare his way. So let him land, And solemnly see him set on to London. So swift a pace hath thought that even now You may imagine him upon Blackheath, Where that his lords desire him to have borne His bruised helmet and his bended sword Before him through the city. He forbids it, Being free from vainness and self-glorious pride; Giving full trophy, signal, and ostent Quite from himself to God. But now behold, In the quick forge and working-house of thought, How London doth pour out her citizens! The mayor and all his brethren in best sort, Like to the senators of th’ antique Rome, With the plebeians swarming at their heels, Go forth and fetch their conquering Caesar in; As, by a lower but loving likelihood, Were now the general of our gracious empress, As in good time he may, from Ireland coming, Bringing rebellion broached on his sword, How many would the peaceful city quit, To welcome him! Much more, and much more cause, Did they this Harry. Now in London place him; As yet the lamentation of the French Invites the King of England’s stay at home, The Emperor’s coming in behalf of France, To order peace between them;—and omit All the occurrences, whatever chanc’d, Till Harry’s back-return again to France. There must we bring him; and myself have play’d The interim, by rememb’ring you ’tis past. Then brook abridgement, and your eyes advance After your thoughts, straight back again to France.   [_Exit._]  SCENE I. France. The English camp.   Enter Fluellen and Gower.  GOWER. Nay, that’s right; but why wear you your leek today? Saint Davy’s day is past.  FLUELLEN. There is occasions and causes why and wherefore in all things. I will tell you ass my friend, Captain Gower. The rascally, scald, beggarly, lousy, pragging knave, Pistol, which you and yourself and all the world know to be no petter than a fellow, look you now, of no merits, he is come to me and prings me pread and salt yesterday, look you, and bid me eat my leek. It was in a place where I could not breed no contention with him; but I will be so bold as to wear it in my cap till I see him once again, and then I will tell him a little piece of my desires.   Enter Pistol.  GOWER. Why, here he comes, swelling like a turkey-cock.  FLUELLEN. ’Tis no matter for his swellings nor his turkey-cocks. God pless you, Anchient Pistol! you scurvy, lousy knave, God pless you!  PISTOL. Ha! art thou bedlam? Dost thou thirst, base Trojan, To have me fold up Parca’s fatal web? Hence! I am qualmish at the smell of leek.  FLUELLEN. I peseech you heartily, scurfy, lousy knave, at my desires, and my requests, and my petitions, to eat, look you, this leek. Because, look you, you do not love it, nor your affections and your appetites and your digestions does not agree with it, I would desire you to eat it.  PISTOL. Not for Cadwallader and all his goats.  FLUELLEN. There is one goat for you. [_Strikes him._] Will you be so good, scald knave, as eat it?  PISTOL. Base Trojan, thou shalt die.  FLUELLEN. You say very true, scald knave, when God’s will is. I will desire you to live in the mean time, and eat your victuals. Come, there is sauce for it. [_Strikes him._] You call’d me yesterday mountain-squire; but I will make you today a squire of low degree. I pray you, fall to; if you can mock a leek, you can eat a leek.  GOWER. Enough, captain; you have astonish’d him.  FLUELLEN. I say, I will make him eat some part of my leek, or I will peat his pate four days. Bite, I pray you; it is good for your green wound and your ploody coxcomb.  PISTOL. Must I bite?  FLUELLEN. Yes, certainly, and out of doubt and out of question too, and ambiguities.  PISTOL. By this leek, I will most horribly revenge. I eat and eat, I swear—  FLUELLEN. Eat, I pray you. Will you have some more sauce to your leek? There is not enough leek to swear by.  PISTOL. Quiet thy cudgel; thou dost see I eat.  FLUELLEN. Much good do you, scald knave, heartily. Nay, pray you, throw none away; the skin is good for your broken coxcomb. When you take occasions to see leeks hereafter, I pray you, mock at ’em; that is all.  PISTOL. Good.  FLUELLEN. Ay, leeks is good. Hold you, there is a groat to heal your pate.  PISTOL. Me a groat!  FLUELLEN. Yes, verily and in truth you shall take it; or I have another leek in my pocket, which you shall eat.  PISTOL. I take thy groat in earnest of revenge.  FLUELLEN. If I owe you anything I will pay you in cudgels. You shall be a woodmonger, and buy nothing of me but cudgels. God be wi’ you, and keep you, and heal your pate.   [_Exit._]  PISTOL. All hell shall stir for this.  GOWER. Go, go; you are a couterfeit cowardly knave. Will you mock at an ancient tradition, begun upon an honourable respect, and worn as a memorable trophy of predeceased valour, and dare not avouch in your deeds any of your words? I have seen you gleeking and galling at this gentleman twice or thrice. You thought, because he could not speak English in the native garb, he could not therefore handle an English cudgel. You find it otherwise; and henceforth let a Welsh correction teach you a good English condition. Fare ye well.   [_Exit._]  PISTOL. Doth Fortune play the huswife with me now? News have I, that my Doll is dead i’ the spital Of malady of France; And there my rendezvous is quite cut off. Old I do wax; and from my weary limbs Honour is cudgell’d. Well, bawd I’ll turn, And something lean to cutpurse of quick hand. To England will I steal, and there I’ll steal; And patches will I get unto these cudgell’d scars, And swear I got them in the Gallia wars.   [_Exit._]  SCENE II. France. A royal palace.   Enter at one door, King Henry, Exeter, Bedford, Warwick, Gloucester,  Westmorland, Clarence, Huntingdon and other Lords. At another, Queen  Isabel, the French King, the Princess Katharine, Alice, and other  Ladies; the Duke of Burgundy and other French.  KING HENRY. Peace to this meeting, wherefore we are met! Unto our brother France, and to our sister, Health and fair time of day; joy and good wishes To our most fair and princely cousin Katharine; And, as a branch and member of this royalty, By whom this great assembly is contriv’d, We do salute you, Duke of Burgundy; And, princes French, and peers, health to you all!  FRENCH KING. Right joyous are we to behold your face, Most worthy brother England; fairly met! So are you, princes English, every one.  QUEEN ISABEL. So happy be the issue, brother England, Of this good day and of this gracious meeting As we are now glad to behold your eyes; Your eyes, which hitherto have borne in them Against the French that met them in their bent The fatal balls of murdering basilisks. The venom of such looks, we fairly hope, Have lost their quality; and that this day Shall change all griefs and quarrels into love.  KING HENRY. To cry amen to that, thus we appear.  QUEEN ISABEL. You English princes all, I do salute you.  BURGUNDY. My duty to you both, on equal love, Great Kings of France and England! That I have labour’d, With all my wits, my pains, and strong endeavours, To bring your most imperial Majesties Unto this bar and royal interview, Your mightiness on both parts best can witness. Since then my office hath so far prevail’d That, face to face and royal eye to eye, You have congreeted, let it not disgrace me If I demand, before this royal view, What rub or what impediment there is, Why that the naked, poor, and mangled Peace, Dear nurse of arts, plenties, and joyful births, Should not in this best garden of the world, Our fertile France, put up her lovely visage? Alas, she hath from France too long been chas’d, And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps, Corrupting in it own fertility. Her vine, the merry cheerer of the heart, Unpruned dies; her hedges even-pleach’d, Like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair, Put forth disorder’d twigs; her fallow leas The darnel, hemlock, and rank fumitory, Doth root upon, while that the coulter rusts That should deracinate such savagery; The even mead, that erst brought sweetly forth The freckled cowslip, burnet, and green clover, Wanting the scythe, all uncorrected, rank, Conceives by idleness, and nothing teems But hateful docks, rough thistles, kecksies, burs, Losing both beauty and utility; And as our vineyards, fallows, meads, and hedges, Defective in their natures, grow to wildness. Even so our houses and ourselves and children Have lost, or do not learn for want of time, The sciences that should become our country; But grow like savages,—as soldiers will That nothing do but meditate on blood,— To swearing and stern looks, diffus’d attire, And everything that seems unnatural. Which to reduce into our former favour You are assembled; and my speech entreats That I may know the let, why gentle Peace Should not expel these inconveniences And bless us with her former qualities.  KING HENRY. If, Duke of Burgundy, you would the peace, Whose want gives growth to the imperfections Which you have cited, you must buy that peace With full accord to all our just demands; Whose tenours and particular effects You have enschedul’d briefly in your hands.  BURGUNDY. The King hath heard them; to the which as yet There is no answer made.  KING HENRY. Well, then, the peace, Which you before so urg’d, lies in his answer.  FRENCH KING. I have but with a cursorary eye O’erglanc’d the articles. Pleaseth your Grace To appoint some of your council presently To sit with us once more, with better heed To re-survey them, we will suddenly Pass our accept and peremptory answer.  KING HENRY. Brother, we shall. Go, uncle Exeter, And brother Clarence, and you, brother Gloucester, Warwick, and Huntington, go with the King; And take with you free power to ratify, Augment, or alter, as your wisdoms best Shall see advantageable for our dignity, Anything in or out of our demands, And we’ll consign thereto. Will you, fair sister, Go with the princes, or stay here with us?  QUEEN ISABEL. Our gracious brother, I will go with them. Haply a woman’s voice may do some good, When articles too nicely urg’d be stood on.  KING HENRY. Yet leave our cousin Katharine here with us: She is our capital demand, compris’d Within the fore-rank of our articles.  QUEEN ISABEL. She hath good leave.   [_Exeunt all except Henry, Katharine and Alice._]  KING HENRY. Fair Katharine, and most fair, Will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady’s ear And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?  KATHARINE. Your Majesty shall mock me; I cannot speak your England.  KING HENRY. O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?  KATHARINE. _Pardonnez-moi_, I cannot tell wat is “like me.”  KING HENRY. An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.  KATHARINE. _Que dit-il? Que je suis semblable à les anges?_  ALICE. _Oui, vraiment, sauf votre Grâce, ainsi dit-il._  KING HENRY. I said so, dear Katharine; and I must not blush to affirm it.  KATHARINE. _O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tromperies._  KING HENRY. What says she, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?  ALICE. _Oui_, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits: dat is de Princess.  KING HENRY. The Princess is the better Englishwoman. I’ faith, Kate, my wooing is fit for thy understanding. I am glad thou canst speak no better English; for if thou couldst, thou wouldst find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my crown. I know no ways to mince it in love, but directly to say, “I love you”; then if you urge me farther than to say, “Do you in faith?” I wear out my suit. Give me your answer; i’ faith, do; and so clap hands and a bargain. How say you, lady?  KATHARINE. _Sauf votre honneur_, me understand well.  KING HENRY. Marry, if you would put me to verses, or to dance for your sake, Kate, why you undid me; for the one, I have neither words nor measure, and for the other I have no strength in measure, yet a reasonable measure in strength. If I could win a lady at leap-frog, or by vaulting into my saddle with my armour on my back, under the correction of bragging be it spoken, I should quickly leap into a wife. Or if I might buffet for my love, or bound my horse for her favours, I could lay on like a butcher and sit like a jack-an-apes, never off. But, before God, Kate, I cannot look greenly, nor gasp out my eloquence, nor I have no cunning in protestation; only downright oaths, which I never use till urg’d, nor never break for urging. If thou canst love a fellow of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth sunburning, that never looks in his glass for love of anything he sees there, let thine eye be thy cook. I speak to thee plain soldier. If thou canst love me for this, take me; if not, to say to thee that I shall die, is true; but for thy love, by the Lord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thou liv’st, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain and uncoined constancy; for he perforce must do thee right, because he hath not the gift to woo in other places; for these fellows of infinite tongue, that can rhyme themselves into ladies’ favours, they do always reason themselves out again. What! a speaker is but a prater: a rhyme is but a ballad. A good leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a black beard will turn white; a curl’d pate will grow bald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax hollow; but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the moon; or rather the sun and not the moon; for it shines bright and never changes, but keeps his course truly. If thou would have such a one, take me; and take me, take a soldier; take a soldier, take a king. And what say’st thou then to my love? Speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.  KATHARINE. Is it possible dat I should love de enemy of France?  KING HENRY. No; it is not possible you should love the enemy of France, Kate; but, in loving me, you should love the friend of France; for I love France so well that I will not part with a village of it, I will have it all mine; and, Kate, when France is mine and I am yours, then yours is France and you are mine.  KATHARINE. I cannot tell wat is dat.  KING HENRY. No, Kate? I will tell thee in French; which I am sure will hang upon my tongue like a new-married wife about her husband’s neck, hardly to be shook off. _Je quand sur le possession de France, et quand vous avez le possession de moi_,—let me see, what then? Saint Denis be my speed!—_donc votre est France, et vous êtes mienne._ It is as easy for me, Kate, to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much more French. I shall never move thee in French, unless it be to laugh at me.  KATHARINE. _Sauf votre honneur, le français que vous parlez, il est meilleur que l’anglais lequel je parle._  KING HENRY. No, faith, is’t not, Kate; but thy speaking of my tongue, and I thine, most truly-falsely, must needs be granted to be much at one. But, Kate, dost thou understand thus much English: canst thou love me?  KATHARINE. I cannot tell.  KING HENRY. Can any of your neighbours tell, Kate? I’ll ask them. Come, I know thou lovest me; and at night, when you come into your closet, you’ll question this gentlewoman about me; and I know, Kate, you will to her dispraise those parts in me that you love with your heart. But, good Kate, mock me mercifully; the rather, gentle princess, because I love thee cruelly. If ever thou beest mine, Kate, as I have a saving faith within me tells me thou shalt, I get thee with scambling, and thou must therefore needs prove a good soldier-breeder. Shall not thou and I, between Saint Denis and Saint George, compound a boy, half French, half English, that shall go to Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard? Shall we not? What say’st thou, my fair flower-de-luce?  KATHARINE. I do not know dat.  KING HENRY. No; ’tis hereafter to know, but now to promise. Do but now promise, Kate, you will endeavour for your French part of such a boy; and for my English moiety, take the word of a king and a bachelor. How answer you, _la plus belle Katherine du monde, mon très cher et divin déesse?_  KATHARINE. Your Majestee ’ave _fausse_ French enough to deceive de most _sage demoiselle_ dat is _en France_.  KING HENRY. Now, fie upon my false French! By mine honour, in true English, I love thee, Kate; by which honour I dare not swear thou lovest me; yet my blood begins to flatter me that thou dost, notwithstanding the poor and untempering effect of my visage. Now, beshrew my father’s ambition! He was thinking of civil wars when he got me; therefore was I created with a stubborn outside, with an aspect of iron, that, when I come to woo ladies, I fright them. But, in faith, Kate, the elder I wax, the better I shall appear. My comfort is, that old age, that ill layer up of beauty, can do no more spoil upon my face. Thou hast me, if thou hast me, at the worst; and thou shalt wear me, if thou wear me, better and better; and therefore tell me, most fair Katharine, will you have me? Put off your maiden blushes; avouch the thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress; take me by the hand, and say, Harry of England, I am thine; which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine ear withal, but I will tell thee aloud, England is thine, Ireland is thine, France is thine, and Henry Plantagenet is thine; who, though I speak it before his face, if he be not fellow with the best king, thou shalt find the best king of good fellows. Come, your answer in broken music; for thy voice is music and thy English broken; therefore, queen of all, Katharine, break thy mind to me in broken English. Wilt thou have me?  KATHARINE. Dat is as it shall please _le roi mon père_.  KING HENRY. Nay, it will please him well, Kate; it shall please him, Kate.  KATHARINE. Den it sall also content me.  KING HENRY. Upon that I kiss your hand, and call you my queen.  KATHARINE. _Laissez, mon seigneur, laissez, laissez! Ma foi, je ne veux point que vous abaissiez votre grandeur en baisant la main d’une—Notre Seigneur!—indigne serviteur. Excusez-moi, je vous supplie, mon très-puissant seigneur._  KING HENRY. Then I will kiss your lips, Kate.  KATHARINE. _Les dames et demoiselles pour être baisées devant leurs noces, il n’est pas la coutume de France._  KING HENRY. Madame my interpreter, what says she?  ALICE. Dat it is not be de fashion _pour les_ ladies of France,—I cannot tell wat is _baiser en_ Anglish.  KING HENRY. To kiss.  ALICE. Your Majestee _entend_ bettre _que moi_.  KING HENRY. It is not a fashion for the maids in France to kiss before they are married, would she say?  ALICE. _Oui, vraiment._  KING HENRY. O Kate, nice customs curtsy to great kings. Dear Kate, you and I cannot be confined within the weak list of a country’s fashion. We are the makers of manners, Kate; and the liberty that follows our places stops the mouth of all find-faults, as I will do yours, for upholding the nice fashion of your country in denying me a kiss; therefore, patiently and yielding. [_Kissing her._] You have witchcraft in your lips, Kate; there is more eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the tongues of the French council; and they should sooner persuade Harry of England than a general petition of monarchs. Here comes your father.   Enter the French Power and the English Lords.  BURGUNDY. God save your Majesty! My royal cousin, teach you our princess English?  KING HENRY. I would have her learn, my fair cousin, how perfectly I love her; and that is good English.  BURGUNDY. Is she not apt?  KING HENRY. Our tongue is rough, coz, and my condition is not smooth; so that, having neither the voice nor the heart of flattery about me, I cannot so conjure up the spirit of love in her, that he will appear in his true likeness.  BURGUNDY. Pardon the frankness of my mirth, if I answer you for that. If you would conjure in her, you must make a circle; if conjure up Love in her in his true likeness, he must appear naked and blind. Can you blame her then, being a maid yet ros’d over with the virgin crimson of modesty, if she deny the appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing self? It were, my lord, a hard condition for a maid to consign to.  KING HENRY. Yet they do wink and yield, as love is blind and enforces.  BURGUNDY. They are then excus’d, my lord, when they see not what they do.  KING HENRY. Then, good my lord, teach your cousin to consent winking.  BURGUNDY. I will wink on her to consent, my lord, if you will teach her to know my meaning; for maids, well summer’d and warm kept, are like flies at Bartholomew-tide, blind, though they have their eyes; and then they will endure handling, which before would not abide looking on.  KING HENRY. This moral ties me over to time and a hot summer; and so I shall catch the fly, your cousin, in the latter end, and she must be blind too.  BURGUNDY. As love is, my lord, before it loves.  KING HENRY. It is so; and you may, some of you, thank love for my blindness, who cannot see many a fair French city for one fair French maid that stands in my way.  FRENCH KING. Yes, my lord, you see them perspectively, the cities turn’d into a maid; for they are all girdled with maiden walls that no war hath entered.  KING HENRY. Shall Kate be my wife?  FRENCH KING. So please you.  KING HENRY. I am content, so the maiden cities you talk of may wait on her; so the maid that stood in the way for my wish shall show me the way to my will.  FRENCH KING. We have consented to all terms of reason.  KING HENRY. Is’t so, my lords of England?  WESTMORLAND. The king hath granted every article; His daughter first, and then in sequel all, According to their firm proposed natures.  EXETER. Only he hath not yet subscribed this: where your Majesty demands, that the King of France, having any occasion to write for matter of grant, shall name your Highness in this form and with this addition, in French, _Notre très-cher fils Henri, Roi d’Angleterre, Héritier de France_; and thus in Latin, _Praeclarissimus filius noster Henricus, rex Angliae et haeres Franciae._  FRENCH KING. Nor this I have not, brother, so denied But our request shall make me let it pass.  KING HENRY. I pray you then, in love and dear alliance, Let that one article rank with the rest; And thereupon give me your daughter.  FRENCH KING. Take her, fair son, and from her blood raise up Issue to me; that the contending kingdoms Of France and England, whose very shores look pale With envy of each other’s happiness, May cease their hatred; and this dear conjunction Plant neighbourhood and Christian-like accord In their sweet bosoms, that never war advance His bleeding sword ’twixt England and fair France.  LORDS. Amen!  KING HENRY. Now, welcome, Kate; and bear me witness all, That here I kiss her as my sovereign queen.   [_Flourish._]  QUEEN ISABEL. God, the best maker of all marriages, Combine your hearts in one, your realms in one! As man and wife, being two, are one in love, So be there ’twixt your kingdoms such a spousal, That never may ill office, or fell jealousy, Which troubles oft the bed of blessed marriage, Thrust in between the paction of these kingdoms, To make divorce of their incorporate league; That English may as French, French Englishmen, Receive each other. God speak this Amen!  ALL. Amen!  KING HENRY. Prepare we for our marriage; on which day, My Lord of Burgundy, we’ll take your oath, And all the peers’, for surety of our leagues, Then shall I swear to Kate, and you to me; And may our oaths well kept and prosperous be!   [_Sennet. Exeunt._]  EPILOGUE.   Enter Chorus.  CHORUS. Thus far, with rough and all-unable pen, Our bending author hath pursu’d the story, In little room confining mighty men, Mangling by starts the full course of their glory. Small time, but in that small most greatly lived This star of England. Fortune made his sword, By which the world’s best garden he achieved, And of it left his son imperial lord. Henry the Sixth, in infant bands crown’d King Of France and England, did this king succeed; Whose state so many had the managing, That they lost France and made his England bleed: Which oft our stage hath shown; and, for their sake, In your fair minds let this acceptance take.

Enter the King, Gloucester, Bishop of Winchester, Talbot, Exeter, York, and Warwick; Suffolk, Somerset, the Governor of Paris, and others.  GLOUCESTER. Lord bishop, set the crown upon his head.  WINCHESTER. God save King Henry, of that name the Sixth!  GLOUCESTER. Now, Governor of Paris, take your oath, That you elect no other king but him; Esteem none friends but such as are his friends, And none your foes but such as shall pretend Malicious practices against his state: This shall ye do, so help you righteous God!  Enter Sir John Fastolf.  FASTOLF. My gracious sovereign, as I rode from Calais, To haste unto your coronation, A letter was deliver’d to my hands, Writ to your Grace from th’ Duke of Burgundy.  TALBOT. Shame to the Duke of Burgundy and thee! I vow’d, base knight, when I did meet thee next, To tear the Garter from thy craven’s leg, [_Plucking it off_.] Which I have done, because unworthily Thou wast installed in that high degree. Pardon me, princely Henry, and the rest. This dastard, at the battle of Patay, When but in all I was six thousand strong And that the French were almost ten to one, Before we met or that a stroke was given, Like to a trusty squire did run away; In which assault we lost twelve hundred men; Myself and divers gentlemen beside Were there surprised and taken prisoners. Then judge, great lords, if I have done amiss, Or whether that such cowards ought to wear This ornament of knighthood, yea or no?  GLOUCESTER. To say the truth, this fact was infamous And ill beseeming any common man, Much more a knight, a captain, and a leader.  TALBOT. When first this Order was ordain’d, my lords, Knights of the Garter were of noble birth, Valiant and virtuous, full of haughty courage, Such as were grown to credit by the wars; Not fearing death nor shrinking for distress, But always resolute in most extremes. He then that is not furnish’d in this sort Doth but usurp the sacred name of knight, Profaning this most honourable Order, And should, if I were worthy to be judge, Be quite degraded, like a hedge-born swain That doth presume to boast of gentle blood.  KING HENRY. Stain to thy countrymen, thou hear’st thy doom! Be packing, therefore, thou that wast a knight; Henceforth we banish thee on pain of death.  [_Exit Fastolf._]  And now, my Lord Protector, view the letter Sent from our uncle, Duke of Burgundy.  GLOUCESTER. What means his Grace, that he hath changed his style? No more but, plain and bluntly, “To the King”! Hath he forgot he is his sovereign? Or doth this churlish superscription Pretend some alteration in good will? What’s here? [_Reads_] “I have, upon especial cause, Moved with compassion of my country’s wrack, Together with the pitiful complaints Of such as your oppression feeds upon, Forsaken your pernicious faction And join’d with Charles, the rightful King of France.” O monstrous treachery! Can this be so, That in alliance, amity, and oaths, There should be found such false dissembling guile?  KING HENRY. What! Doth my uncle Burgundy revolt?  GLOUCESTER. He doth, my lord, and is become your foe.  KING HENRY. Is that the worst this letter doth contain?  GLOUCESTER. It is the worst, and all, my lord, he writes.  KING HENRY. Why, then, Lord Talbot there shall talk with him And give him chastisement for this abuse. How say you, my lord, are you not content?  TALBOT. Content, my liege! Yes, but that I am prevented, I should have begg’d I might have been employ’d.  KING HENRY. Then gather strength and march unto him straight; Let him perceive how ill we brook his treason, And what offence it is to flout his friends.  TALBOT. I go, my lord, in heart desiring still You may behold confusion of your foes.  [_Exit._]  Enter Vernon and Basset.  VERNON. Grant me the combat, gracious sovereign.  BASSET. And me, my lord, grant me the combat too.  YORK. This is my servant; hear him, noble prince.  SOMERSET. And this is mine, sweet Henry, favour him.  KING HENRY. Be patient, lords, and give them leave to speak. Say, gentlemen, what makes you thus exclaim, And wherefore crave you combat, or with whom?  VERNON. With him, my lord, for he hath done me wrong.  BASSET. And I with him, for he hath done me wrong.  KING HENRY. What is that wrong whereof you both complain? First let me know, and then I’ll answer you.  BASSET. Crossing the sea from England into France, This fellow here, with envious carping tongue, Upbraided me about the rose I wear, Saying the sanguine colour of the leaves Did represent my master’s blushing cheeks When stubbornly he did repugn the truth About a certain question in the law Argued betwixt the Duke of York and him; With other vile and ignominious terms. In confutation of which rude reproach, And in defence of my lord’s worthiness, I crave the benefit of law of arms.  VERNON. And that is my petition, noble lord; For though he seem with forged quaint conceit To set a gloss upon his bold intent, Yet know, my lord, I was provoked by him, And he first took exceptions at this badge, Pronouncing that the paleness of this flower Bewray’d the faintness of my master’s heart.  YORK. Will not this malice, Somerset, be left?  SOMERSET. Your private grudge, my Lord of York, will out, Though ne’er so cunningly you smother it.  KING HENRY. Good Lord, what madness rules in brainsick men, When for so slight and frivolous a cause Such factious emulations shall arise! Good cousins both, of York and Somerset, Quiet yourselves, I pray, and be at peace.  YORK. Let this dissension first be tried by fight, And then your Highness shall command a peace.  SOMERSET. The quarrel toucheth none but us alone; Betwixt ourselves let us decide it then.  YORK. There is my pledge; accept it, Somerset.  VERNON. Nay, let it rest where it began at first.  BASSET. Confirm it so, mine honourable lord.  GLOUCESTER. Confirm it so! Confounded be your strife! And perish ye, with your audacious prate! Presumptuous vassals, are you not ashamed With this immodest clamorous outrage To trouble and disturb the King and us? And you, my lords, methinks you do not well To bear with their perverse objections, Much less to take occasion from their mouths To raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves. Let me persuade you take a better course.  EXETER. It grieves his Highness. Good my lords, be friends.  KING HENRY. Come hither, you that would be combatants: Henceforth I charge you, as you love our favour, Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause. And you, my lords, remember where we are: In France, amongst a fickle wavering nation; If they perceive dissension in our looks, And that within ourselves we disagree, How will their grudging stomachs be provoked To willful disobedience, and rebel! Beside, what infamy will there arise When foreign princes shall be certified That for a toy, a thing of no regard, King Henry’s peers and chief nobility Destroy’d themselves and lost the realm of France! O, think upon the conquest of my father, My tender years, and let us not forgo That for a trifle that was bought with blood! Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife. I see no reason if I wear this rose,  [_Putting on a red rose._]  That anyone should therefore be suspicious I more incline to Somerset than York. Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both. As well they may upbraid me with my crown Because, forsooth, the King of Scots is crown’d. But your discretions better can persuade Than I am able to instruct or teach; And therefore, as we hither came in peace, So let us still continue peace and love. Cousin of York, we institute your Grace To be our Regent in these parts of France; And, good my Lord of Somerset, unite Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot; And like true subjects, sons of your progenitors, Go cheerfully together and digest Your angry choler on your enemies. Ourself, my Lord Protector, and the rest After some respite will return to Calais; From thence to England, where I hope ere long To be presented, by your victories, With Charles, Alençon, and that traitorous rout.  [_Flourish. Exeunt all but York, Warwick, Exeter and Vernon._]  WARWICK. My Lord of York, I promise you the King Prettily, methought, did play the orator.  YORK. And so he did; but yet I like it not, In that he wears the badge of Somerset.  WARWICK. Tush, that was but his fancy; blame him not; I dare presume, sweet prince, he thought no harm.  YORK. An if I wist he did—but let it rest; Other affairs must now be managed.  [_Exeunt all but Exeter._]  EXETER. Well didst thou, Richard, to suppress thy voice; For, had the passions of thy heart burst out, I fear we should have seen decipher’d there More rancorous spite, more furious raging broils, Than yet can be imagined or supposed. But howsoe’er, no simple man that sees This jarring discord of nobility, This shouldering of each other in the court, This factious bandying of their favourites, But sees it doth presage some ill event. ’Tis much when scepters are in children’s hands; But more when envy breeds unkind division: There comes the ruin, there begins confusion.  [_Exit._]  SCENE II. Before Bordeaux.  Enter Talbot with trump and drum.  TALBOT. Go to the gates of Bordeaux, trumpeter. Summon their general unto the wall.  Trumpet sounds. Enter  General and others aloft.  English John Talbot, captains, calls you forth, Servant in arms to Harry King of England; And thus he would: Open your city gates, Be humble to us, call my sovereign yours, And do him homage as obedient subjects, And I’ll withdraw me and my bloody power. But if you frown upon this proffer’d peace, You tempt the fury of my three attendants, Lean Famine, quartering Steel, and climbing Fire, Who in a moment even with the earth Shall lay your stately and air-braving towers, If you forsake the offer of their love.  GENERAL. Thou ominous and fearful owl of death, Our nation’s terror and their bloody scourge! The period of thy tyranny approacheth. On us thou canst not enter but by death; For, I protest, we are well fortified And strong enough to issue out and fight. If thou retire, the Dauphin, well appointed, Stands with the snares of war to tangle thee. On either hand thee there are squadrons pitch’d To wall thee from the liberty of flight; And no way canst thou turn thee for redress But Death doth front thee with apparent spoil, And pale Destruction meets thee in the face. Ten thousand French have ta’en the sacrament To rive their dangerous artillery Upon no Christian soul but English Talbot. Lo, there thou stand’st, a breathing valiant man Of an invincible unconquer’d spirit. This is the latest glory of thy praise That I, thy enemy, due thee withal; For ere the glass, that now begins to run, Finish the process of his sandy hour, These eyes, that see thee now well coloured, Shall see thee wither’d, bloody, pale, and dead.  [_Drum afar off._]  Hark, hark, the Dauphin’s drum, a warning bell, Sings heavy music to thy timorous soul, And mine shall ring thy dire departure out.  [_Exeunt General, etc._]  TALBOT. He fables not; I hear the enemy. Out, some light horsemen, and peruse their wings. O, negligent and heedless discipline! How are we park’d and bounded in a pale, A little herd of England’s timorous deer, Mazed with a yelping kennel of French curs! If we be English deer, be then in blood; Not rascal-like, to fall down with a pinch, But rather, moody-mad and desperate stags, Turn on the bloody hounds with heads of steel And make the cowards stand aloof at bay. Sell every man his life as dear as mine, And they shall find dear deer of us, my friends. God and Saint George, Talbot and England’s right, Prosper our colours in this dangerous fight!  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. Plains in Gascony.  Enter a Messenger that meets York. Enter York with trumpet and many soldiers  YORK. Are not the speedy scouts return’d again That dogg’d the mighty army of the Dauphin?  MESSENGER. They are return’d, my lord, and give it out That he is march’d to Bordeaux with his power, To fight with Talbot. As he march’d along, By your espials were discovered Two mightier troops than that the Dauphin led, Which join’d with him and made their march for Bordeaux.  [_Exit._]  YORK. A plague upon that villain Somerset That thus delays my promised supply Of horsemen that were levied for this siege! Renowned Talbot doth expect my aid, And I am louted by a traitor villain And cannot help the noble chevalier. God comfort him in this necessity! If he miscarry, farewell wars in France.  Enter Sir William Lucy.  LUCY. Thou princely leader of our English strength, Never so needful on the earth of France, Spur to the rescue of the noble Talbot, Who now is girdled with a waist of iron, And hemm’d about with grim destruction. To Bordeaux, warlike Duke! To Bordeaux, York! Else farewell, Talbot, France, and England’s honour.  YORK. O God, that Somerset, who in proud heart Doth stop my cornets, were in Talbot’s place! So should we save a valiant gentleman By forfeiting a traitor and a coward. Mad ire and wrathful fury makes me weep That thus we die while remiss traitors sleep.  LUCY. O, send some succour to the distress’d lord!  YORK. He dies, we lose; I break my warlike word; We mourn, France smiles; we lose, they daily get, All long of this vile traitor Somerset.  LUCY. Then God take mercy on brave Talbot’s soul, And on his son young John, who two hours since I met in travel toward his warlike father. This seven years did not Talbot see his son; And now they meet where both their lives are done.  YORK. Alas, what joy shall noble Talbot have To bid his young son welcome to his grave? Away! Vexation almost stops my breath, That sunder’d friends greet in the hour of death. Lucy, farewell. No more my fortune can But curse the cause I cannot aid the man. Maine, Blois, Poictiers, and Tours, are won away, Long all of Somerset and his delay.  [_Exit, with his soldiers._]  LUCY. Thus, while the vulture of sedition Feeds in the bosom of such great commanders, Sleeping neglection doth betray to loss The conquest of our scarce-cold conqueror, That ever-living man of memory, Henry the Fifth. Whiles they each other cross, Lives, honours, lands, and all hurry to loss.  [_Exit._]  SCENE IV. Other plains in Gascony.  Enter Somerset with his army; a Captain of Talbot’s with him.  SOMERSET. It is too late; I cannot send them now. This expedition was by York and Talbot Too rashly plotted. All our general force Might with a sally of the very town Be buckled with. The over-daring Talbot Hath sullied all his gloss of former honour By this unheedful, desperate, wild adventure. York set him on to fight and die in shame That, Talbot dead, great York might bear the name.  CAPTAIN. Here is Sir William Lucy, who with me Set from our o’er-match’d forces forth for aid.  Enter Sir William Lucy.  SOMERSET. How now, Sir William, whither were you sent?  LUCY. Whither, my lord? From bought and sold Lord Talbot, Who, ring’d about with bold adversity, Cries out for noble York and Somerset To beat assailing Death from his weak legions; And whiles the honourable captain there Drops bloody sweat from his war-wearied limbs, And, in advantage lingering, looks for rescue, You, his false hopes, the trust of England’s honour, Keep off aloof with worthless emulation. Let not your private discord keep away The levied succours that should lend him aid, While he, renowned noble gentleman, Yield up his life unto a world of odds. Orleans the Bastard, Charles, Burgundy, Alençon, Reignier, compass him about, And Talbot perisheth by your default.  SOMERSET. York set him on; York should have sent him aid.  LUCY. And York as fast upon your Grace exclaims, Swearing that you withhold his levied host Collected for this expedition.  SOMERSET. York lies; he might have sent and had the horse. I owe him little duty, and less love, And take foul scorn to fawn on him by sending.  LUCY. The fraud of England, not the force of France, Hath now entrapp’d the noble-minded Talbot. Never to England shall he bear his life, But dies betray’d to fortune by your strife.  SOMERSET. Come, go; I will dispatch the horsemen straight. Within six hours they will be at his aid.  LUCY. Too late comes rescue; he is ta’en or slain, For fly he could not if he would have fled; And fly would Talbot never, though he might.  SOMERSET. If he be dead, brave Talbot, then adieu!  LUCY. His fame lives in the world, his shame in you.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE V. The English camp near Bordeaux.  Enter Talbot and John his son.  TALBOT. O young John Talbot, I did send for thee To tutor thee in stratagems of war, That Talbot’s name might be in thee revived When sapless age and weak unable limbs Should bring thy father to his drooping chair. But—O malignant and ill-boding stars!— Now thou art come unto a feast of death, A terrible and unavoided danger. Therefore, dear boy, mount on my swiftest horse, And I’ll direct thee how thou shalt escape By sudden flight. Come, dally not, be gone.  JOHN TALBOT. Is my name Talbot? And am I your son? And shall I fly? O, if you love my mother, Dishonour not her honourable name, To make a bastard and a slave of me! The world will say, he is not Talbot’s blood, That basely fled when noble Talbot stood.  TALBOT. Fly, to revenge my death if I be slain.  JOHN TALBOT. He that flies so will ne’er return again.  TALBOT. If we both stay, we both are sure to die.  JOHN TALBOT. Then let me stay and, father, do you fly. Your loss is great, so your regard should be; My worth unknown, no loss is known in me. Upon my death the French can little boast; In yours they will, in you all hopes are lost. Flight cannot stain the honour you have won; But mine it will, that no exploit have done. You fled for vantage, everyone will swear; But if I bow, they’ll say it was for fear. There is no hope that ever I will stay If the first hour I shrink and run away. Here on my knee I beg mortality, Rather than life preserved with infamy.  TALBOT. Shall all thy mother’s hopes lie in one tomb?  JOHN TALBOT. Ay, rather than I’ll shame my mother’s womb.  TALBOT. Upon my blessing, I command thee go.  JOHN TALBOT. To fight I will, but not to fly the foe.  TALBOT. Part of thy father may be saved in thee.  JOHN TALBOT. No part of him but will be shame in me.  TALBOT. Thou never hadst renown, nor canst not lose it.  JOHN TALBOT. Yes, your renowned name; shall flight abuse it?  TALBOT. Thy father’s charge shall clear thee from that stain.  JOHN TALBOT. You cannot witness for me, being slain. If death be so apparent, then both fly.  TALBOT. And leave my followers here to fight and die? My age was never tainted with such shame.  JOHN TALBOT. And shall my youth be guilty of such blame? No more can I be sever’d from your side Than can yourself yourself in twain divide. Stay, go, do what you will, the like do I; For live I will not, if my father die.  TALBOT. Then here I take my leave of thee, fair son, Born to eclipse thy life this afternoon. Come, side by side together live and die, And soul with soul from France to heaven fly.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE VI. A field of battle.  Alarum. Excursions, wherein Talbot’s son is hemmed about, and Talbot rescues him.  TALBOT. Saint George and victory! Fight, soldiers, fight! The Regent hath with Talbot broke his word, And left us to the rage of France his sword. Where is John Talbot? Pause, and take thy breath; I gave thee life and rescued thee from death.  JOHN TALBOT. O, twice my father, twice am I thy son! The life thou gav’st me first was lost and done, Till with thy warlike sword, despite of fate, To my determined time thou gav’st new date.  TALBOT. When from the Dauphin’s crest thy sword struck fire, It warm’d thy father’s heart with proud desire Of bold-faced victory. Then leaden age, Quicken’d with youthful spleen and warlike rage, Beat down Alençon, Orleans, Burgundy, And from the pride of Gallia rescued thee. The ireful Bastard Orleans, that drew blood From thee, my boy, and had the maidenhood Of thy first fight, I soon encountered, And, interchanging blows, I quickly shed Some of his bastard blood, and in disgrace Bespoke him thus: “Contaminated, base, And misbegotten blood I spill of thine, Mean and right poor, for that pure blood of mine, Which thou didst force from Talbot, my brave boy.” Here, purposing the Bastard to destroy, Came in strong rescue. Speak, thy father’s care, Art thou not weary, John? How dost thou fare? Wilt thou yet leave the battle, boy, and fly, Now thou art seal’d the son of chivalry? Fly, to revenge my death when I am dead; The help of one stands me in little stead. O, too much folly is it, well I wot, To hazard all our lives in one small boat! If I today die not with Frenchmen’s rage, Tomorrow I shall die with mickle age. By me they nothing gain an if I stay; ’Tis but the short’ning of my life one day. In thee thy mother dies, our household’s name, My death’s revenge, thy youth, and England’s fame. All these and more we hazard by thy stay; All these are saved if thou wilt fly away.  JOHN TALBOT. The sword of Orleans hath not made me smart; These words of yours draw life-blood from my heart. On that advantage, bought with such a shame, To save a paltry life and slay bright fame, Before young Talbot from old Talbot fly, The coward horse that bears me fall and die! And like me to the peasant boys of France, To be shame’s scorn and subject of mischance! Surely, by all the glory you have won, An if I fly, I am not Talbot’s son. Then talk no more of flight, it is no boot; If son to Talbot, die at Talbot’s foot.  TALBOT. Then follow thou thy desperate sire of Crete, Thou Icarus; thy life to me is sweet. If thou wilt fight, fight by thy father’s side, And, commendable proved, let’s die in pride.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE VII. Another part of the field.  Alarum. Excursions. Enter old Talbot led by a Servant.  TALBOT. Where is my other life? Mine own is gone. O, where’s young Talbot? Where is valiant John? Triumphant Death, smear’d with captivity, Young Talbot’s valour makes me smile at thee. When he perceived me shrink and on my knee, His bloody sword he brandish’d over me, And like a hungry lion did commence Rough deeds of rage and stern impatience; But when my angry guardant stood alone, Tendering my ruin and assail’d of none, Dizzy-ey’d fury and great rage of heart Suddenly made him from my side to start Into the clustering battle of the French; And in that sea of blood my boy did drench His over-mounting spirit; and there died My Icarus, my blossom, in his pride.  SERVANT. O my dear lord, lo where your son is borne!  Enter soldiers, with the body of young Talbot.  TALBOT. Thou antic Death, which laugh’st us here to scorn, Anon, from thy insulting tyranny, Coupled in bonds of perpetuity, Two Talbots, winged through the lither sky, In thy despite shall scape mortality. O thou whose wounds become hard-favour’d Death, Speak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath! Brave Death by speaking, whether he will or no; Imagine him a Frenchman and thy foe. Poor boy, he smiles, methinks, as who should say, Had Death been French, then Death had died today. Come, come, and lay him in his father’s arms; My spirit can no longer bear these harms. Soldiers, adieu! I have what I would have, Now my old arms are young John Talbot’s grave.  [_Dies._]  Enter Charles, Alençon, Burgundy, Bastard, La Pucelle and forces.  CHARLES. Had York and Somerset brought rescue in, We should have found a bloody day of this.  BASTARD. How the young whelp of Talbot’s, raging-wood, Did flesh his puny sword in Frenchmen’s blood!  PUCELLE. Once I encounter’d him, and thus I said: “Thou maiden youth, be vanquish’d by a maid.” But with a proud majestical high scorn He answer’d thus: “Young Talbot was not born To be the pillage of a giglot wench.” So, rushing in the bowels of the French, He left me proudly, as unworthy fight.  BURGUNDY. Doubtless he would have made a noble knight. See, where he lies inhearsed in the arms Of the most bloody nurser of his harms.  BASTARD. Hew them to pieces, hack their bones asunder, Whose life was England’s glory, Gallia’s wonder.  CHARLES. O, no, forbear! For that which we have fled During the life, let us not wrong it dead.  Enter Sir William Lucy and a French Herald.  LUCY. Herald, conduct me to the Dauphin’s tent, To know who hath obtain’d the glory of the day.  CHARLES. On what submissive message art thou sent?  LUCY. Submission, Dauphin! ’Tis a mere French word. We English warriors wot not what it means. I come to know what prisoners thou hast ta’en, And to survey the bodies of the dead.  CHARLES. For prisoners ask’st thou? Hell our prison is. But tell me whom thou seek’st.  LUCY. But where’s the great Alcides of the field, Valiant Lord Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury, Created for his rare success in arms Great Earl of Washford, Waterford, and Valence, Lord Talbot of Goodrig and Urchinfield, Lord Strange of Blackmere, Lord Verdun of Alton, Lord Cromwell of Wingfield, Lord Furnival of Sheffield, The thrice victorious Lord of Falconbridge, Knight of the noble Order of Saint George, Worthy Saint Michael, and the Golden Fleece, Great Marshal to Henry the Sixth Of all his wars within the realm of France?  PUCELLE. Here’s a silly stately style indeed! The Turk, that two and fifty kingdoms hath, Writes not so tedious a style as this. Him that thou magnifiest with all these titles Stinking and fly-blown lies here at our feet.  LUCY. Is Talbot slain, the Frenchman’s only scourge, Your kingdom’s terror and black Nemesis? O, were mine eye-balls into bullets turn’d, That I in rage might shoot them at your faces! O, that I could but call these dead to life! It were enough to fright the realm of France. Were but his picture left amongst you here, It would amaze the proudest of you all. Give me their bodies, that I may bear them hence And give them burial as beseems their worth.  PUCELLE. I think this upstart is old Talbot’s ghost, He speaks with such a proud commanding spirit. For God’s sake, let him have them; to keep them here, They would but stink and putrify the air.  CHARLES. Go, take their bodies hence.  LUCY. I’ll bear them hence; But from their ashes shall be rear’d A phoenix that shall make all France afeard.  CHARLES. So we be rid of them, do with them what thou wilt. And now to Paris in this conquering vein. All will be ours, now bloody Talbot’s slain.  [_Exeunt._]

  ACT I  SCENE I. London. The palace
Flourish of trumpets, then hautboys. Enter the King, Gloucester, Salisbury, Warwick, and Cardinal Beaufort on the one side; the Queen, Suffolk, York, Somerset and Buckingham on the other.  SUFFOLK. As by your high imperial Majesty I had in charge at my depart for France, As procurator to your excellence, To marry Princess Margaret for your grace, So, in the famous ancient city Tours, In presence of the Kings of France and Sicil, The Dukes of Orleans, Calaber, Bretagne, and Alençon, Seven earls, twelve barons, and twenty reverend bishops, I have performed my task and was espoused, And humbly now upon my bended knee, In sight of England and her lordly peers, Deliver up my title in the Queen To your most gracious hands, that are the substance Of that great shadow I did represent: The happiest gift that ever marquess gave, The fairest queen that ever king received.  KING HENRY. Suffolk, arise.—Welcome, Queen Margaret. I can express no kinder sign of love Than this kind kiss.—O Lord, that lends me life, Lend me a heart replete with thankfulness! For Thou hast given me in this beauteous face A world of earthly blessings to my soul, If sympathy of love unite our thoughts.  QUEEN MARGARET. Great King of England and my gracious lord, The mutual conference that my mind hath had By day, by night, waking and in my dreams, In courtly company or at my beads, With you, mine alderliefest sovereign, Makes me the bolder to salute my King With ruder terms, such as my wit affords And overjoy of heart doth minister.  KING HENRY. Her sight did ravish, but her grace in speech, Her words yclad with wisdom’s majesty, Makes me from wondering fall to weeping joys, Such is the fulness of my heart’s content. Lords, with one cheerful voice welcome my love.  ALL. [_Kneeling_.] Long live Queen Margaret, England’s happiness!  QUEEN MARGARET. We thank you all.  [_Flourish._]  SUFFOLK. My Lord Protector, so it please your grace, Here are the articles of contracted peace Between our sovereign and the French king Charles, For eighteen months concluded by consent.  GLOUCESTER. [_Reads_.] Imprimis, _it is agreed between the French king Charles and William de la Pole, Marquess of Suffolk, ambassador for Henry, King of England, that the said Henry shall espouse the Lady Margaret, daughter unto Reignier King of Naples, Sicilia, and Jerusalem, and crown her Queen of England ere the thirtieth of May next ensuing._ Item, _that the duchy of Anjou and the county of Maine shall be released and delivered to the King her father_—  [_Lets the paper fall._]  KING HENRY. Uncle, how now?  GLOUCESTER. Pardon me, gracious lord. Some sudden qualm hath struck me at the heart And dimmed mine eyes, that I can read no further.  KING HENRY. Uncle of Winchester, I pray read on.  CARDINAL. [_Reads_.] Item, _it is further agreed between them, that the duchies of Anjou and Maine shall be released and delivered to the King her father, and she sent over of the King of England’s own proper cost and charges, without having any dowry._  KING HENRY. They please us well.—Lord Marquess, kneel down. We here create thee the first Duke of Suffolk, And girt thee with the sword.—Cousin of York, We here discharge your grace from being regent I’ th’ parts of France, till term of eighteen months Be full expired.—Thanks, uncle Winchester, Gloucester, York, Buckingham, Somerset, Salisbury, and Warwick; We thank you all for this great favour done In entertainment to my princely Queen. Come, let us in, and with all speed provide To see her coronation be performed.  [_Exeunt King, Queen and Suffolk._]  GLOUCESTER. Brave peers of England, pillars of the state, To you Duke Humphrey must unload his grief, Your grief, the common grief of all the land. What! Did my brother Henry spend his youth, His valour, coin, and people, in the wars? Did he so often lodge in open field, In winter’s cold and summer’s parching heat, To conquer France, his true inheritance? And did my brother Bedford toil his wits To keep by policy what Henry got? Have you yourselves, Somerset, Buckingham, Brave York, Salisbury, and victorious Warwick, Received deep scars in France and Normandy? Or hath mine uncle Beaufort and myself, With all the learned council of the realm, Studied so long, sat in the council house Early and late, debating to and fro How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe, And had his highness in his infancy Crowned in Paris in despite of foes? And shall these labours and these honours die? Shall Henry’s conquest, Bedford’s vigilance, Your deeds of war, and all our counsel die? O peers of England, shameful is this league! Fatal this marriage, cancelling your fame, Blotting your names from books of memory, Razing the characters of your renown, Defacing monuments of conquered France, Undoing all, as all had never been!  CARDINAL. Nephew, what means this passionate discourse, This peroration with such circumstance? For France, ’tis ours; and we will keep it still.  GLOUCESTER. Ay, uncle, we will keep it if we can, But now it is impossible we should. Suffolk, the new-made duke that rules the roast, Hath given the duchy of Anjou and Maine Unto the poor King Reignier, whose large style Agrees not with the leanness of his purse.  SALISBURY. Now, by the death of Him that died for all, These counties were the keys of Normandy! But wherefore weeps Warwick, my valiant son?  WARWICK. For grief that they are past recovery; For, were there hope to conquer them again, My sword should shed hot blood, mine eyes no tears. Anjou and Maine! Myself did win them both, Those provinces these arms of mine did conquer; And are the cities that I got with wounds Delivered up again with peaceful words? _Mort Dieu!_  YORK. For Suffolk’s duke, may he be suffocate, That dims the honour of this warlike isle! France should have torn and rent my very heart Before I would have yielded to this league. I never read but England’s kings have had Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives; And our King Henry gives away his own, To match with her that brings no vantages.  GLOUCESTER. A proper jest, and never heard before, That Suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth For costs and charges in transporting her! She should have staid in France, and starved in France, Before—  CARDINAL. My Lord of Gloucester, now ye grow too hot. It was the pleasure of my lord the King.  GLOUCESTER. My Lord of Winchester, I know your mind. ’Tis not my speeches that you do mislike, But ’tis my presence that doth trouble ye. Rancour will out. Proud prelate, in thy face I see thy fury. If I longer stay, We shall begin our ancient bickerings.— Lordings, farewell; and say, when I am gone, I prophesied France will be lost ere long.  [_Exit._]  CARDINAL. So, there goes our Protector in a rage. ’Tis known to you he is mine enemy, Nay, more, an enemy unto you all, And no great friend, I fear me, to the King. Consider, lords, he is the next of blood And heir apparent to the English crown. Had Henry got an empire by his marriage, And all the wealthy kingdoms of the west, There’s reason he should be displeased at it. Look to it, lords. Let not his smoothing words Bewitch your hearts; be wise and circumspect. What though the common people favour him, Calling him “Humphrey, the good Duke of Gloucester,” Clapping their hands, and crying with loud voice, “Jesu maintain your royal excellence!” With “God preserve the good Duke Humphrey!” I fear me, lords, for all this flattering gloss, He will be found a dangerous Protector.  BUCKINGHAM. Why should he, then, protect our sovereign, He being of age to govern of himself? Cousin of Somerset, join you with me, And all together, with the Duke of Suffolk, We’ll quickly hoist Duke Humphrey from his seat.  CARDINAL. This weighty business will not brook delay; I’ll to the Duke of Suffolk presently.  [_Exit._]  SOMERSET. Cousin of Buckingham, though Humphrey’s pride And greatness of his place be grief to us, Yet let us watch the haughty cardinal; His insolence is more intolerable Than all the princes’ in the land beside. If Gloucester be displaced, he’ll be Protector.  BUCKINGHAM. Or thou or I, Somerset, will be Protector, Despite Duke Humphrey or the Cardinal.  [_Exeunt Buckingham and Somerset._]  SALISBURY. Pride went before; 	Ambition follows him. While these do labour for their own preferment, Behoves it us to labour for the realm. I never saw but Humphrey Duke of Gloucester, Did bear him like a noble gentleman. Oft have I seen the haughty Cardinal, More like a soldier than a man o’ th’ church, As stout and proud as he were lord of all, Swear like a ruffian and demean himself Unlike the ruler of a commonweal.— Warwick my son, the comfort of my age, Thy deeds, thy plainness, and thy housekeeping, Hath won the greatest favour of the commons, Excepting none but good Duke Humphrey.— And, brother York, thy acts in Ireland, In bringing them to civil discipline, Thy late exploits done in the heart of France, When thou wert regent for our sovereign, Have made thee feared and honoured of the people. Join we together for the public good, In what we can to bridle and suppress The pride of Suffolk and the Cardinal, With Somerset’s and Buckingham’s ambition; And, as we may, cherish Duke Humphrey’s deeds While they do tend the profit of the land.  WARWICK. So God help Warwick, as he loves the land And common profit of his country!  YORK. And so says York, [_Aside_.] for he hath greatest cause.  SALISBURY. Then let’s make haste away and look unto the main.  WARWICK. Unto the main! O father, Maine is lost, That Maine which by main force Warwick did win, And would have kept so long as breath did last! Main chance, father, you meant; but I meant Maine, Which I will win from France, or else be slain.  [_Exeunt Warwick and Salisbury._]  YORK. Anjou and Maine are given to the French; Paris is lost; the state of Normandy Stands on a tickle point now they are gone. Suffolk concluded on the articles, The peers agreed, and Henry was well pleased To change two dukedoms for a duke’s fair daughter. I cannot blame them all. What is’t to them? ’Tis thine they give away, and not their own. Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage, And purchase friends, and give to courtesans, Still revelling like lords till all be gone; Whileas the silly owner of the goods Weeps over them, and wrings his hapless hands, And shakes his head, and trembling stands aloof, While all is shared and all is borne away, Ready to starve and dare not touch his own. So York must sit and fret and bite his tongue, While his own lands are bargained for and sold. Methinks the realms of England, France, and Ireland Bear that proportion to my flesh and blood As did the fatal brand Althaea burnt Unto the prince’s heart of Calydon. Anjou and Maine both given unto the French! Cold news for me, for I had hope of France, Even as I have of fertile England’s soil. A day will come when York shall claim his own; And therefore I will take the Nevilles’ parts, And make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey, And when I spy advantage, claim the crown, For that’s the golden mark I seek to hit. Nor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right, Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist, Nor wear the diadem upon his head, Whose church-like humours fits not for a crown. Then, York, be still awhile till time do serve. Watch thou and wake when others be asleep, To pry into the secrets of the state; Till Henry, surfeiting in joys of love With his new bride and England’s dear-bought Queen, And Humphrey with the peers be fallen at jars. Then will I raise aloft the milk-white rose, With whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed, And in my standard bear the arms of York, To grapple with the house of Lancaster; And force perforce I’ll make him yield the crown, Whose bookish rule hath pulled fair England down.  [_Exit._]  SCENE II. The Duke of Gloucester’s House  Enter Duke Humphrey of Gloucester and his wife Eleanor.  ELEANOR. Why droops my lord, like over-ripened corn Hanging the head at Ceres’ plenteous load? Why doth the great Duke Humphrey knit his brows, As frowning at the favours of the world? Why are thine eyes fixed to the sullen earth, Gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight? What seest thou there? King Henry’s diadem, Enchased with all the honours of the world? If so, gaze on, and grovel on thy face, Until thy head be circled with the same. Put forth thy hand, reach at the glorious gold. What, is’t too short? I’ll lengthen it with mine; And, having both together heaved it up, We’ll both together lift our heads to heaven, And never more abase our sight so low As to vouchsafe one glance unto the ground.  GLOUCESTER. O Nell, sweet Nell, if thou dost love thy lord, Banish the canker of ambitious thoughts. And may that hour when I imagine ill Against my King and nephew, virtuous Henry, Be my last breathing in this mortal world! My troublous dreams this night doth make me sad.  ELEANOR. What dreamed my lord? Tell me, and I’ll requite it With sweet rehearsal of my morning’s dream.  GLOUCESTER. Methought this staff, mine office-badge in court, Was broke in twain; by whom I have forgot, But, as I think, it was by th’ Cardinal, And on the pieces of the broken wand Were placed the heads of Edmund, Duke of Somerset And William de la Pole, first Duke of Suffolk. This was my dream; what it doth bode, God knows.  ELEANOR. Tut, this was nothing but an argument That he that breaks a stick of Gloucester’s grove Shall lose his head for his presumption. But list to me, my Humphrey, my sweet Duke: Methought I sat in seat of majesty In the cathedral church of Westminster And in that chair where kings and queens are crowned, Where Henry and Dame Margaret kneeled to me And on my head did set the diadem.  GLOUCESTER. Nay, Eleanor, then must I chide outright. Presumptuous dame, ill-nurtured Eleanor, Art thou not second woman in the realm, And the Protector’s wife, beloved of him? Hast thou not worldly pleasure at command, Above the reach or compass of thy thought? And wilt thou still be hammering treachery To tumble down thy husband and thyself From top of honour to disgrace’s feet? Away from me, and let me hear no more!  ELEANOR. What, what, my lord! Are you so choleric With Eleanor for telling but her dream? Next time I’ll keep my dreams unto myself, And not be checked.  GLOUCESTER. Nay, be not angry, I am pleased again.  Enter Messenger.  MESSENGER. My Lord Protector, ’tis his highness’ pleasure You do prepare to ride unto Saint Albans, Whereas the King and Queen do mean to hawk.  GLOUCESTER. I go. Come, Nell, thou wilt ride with us?  ELEANOR. Yes, my good lord, I’ll follow presently.  [_Exeunt Gloucester and Messenger._]  Follow I must; I cannot go before While Gloucester bears this base and humble mind. Were I a man, a duke, and next of blood, I would remove these tedious stumbling-blocks And smooth my way upon their headless necks; And, being a woman, I will not be slack To play my part in Fortune’s pageant.— Where are you there? Sir John! Nay, fear not, man, We are alone; here’s none but thee and I.  Enter Hume.  HUME. Jesus preserve your royal majesty!  ELEANOR. What sayst thou? Majesty! I am but grace.  HUME. But, by the grace of God, and Hume’s advice, Your grace’s title shall be multiplied.  ELEANOR. What sayst thou, man? Hast thou as yet conferred With Margery Jourdain, the cunning witch, With Roger Bolingbroke, the conjurer? And will they undertake to do me good?  HUME. This they have promised, to show your highness A spirit raised from depth of underground, That shall make answer to such questions As by your Grace shall be propounded him.  ELEANOR. It is enough, I’ll think upon the questions. When from Saint Albans we do make return, We’ll see these things effected to the full. Here, Hume, take this reward; make merry, man, With thy confederates in this weighty cause.  [_Exit._]  HUME. Hume must make merry with the Duchess’ gold. Marry, and shall. But, how now, Sir John Hume! Seal up your lips, and give no words but mum; The business asketh silent secrecy. Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch; Gold cannot come amiss, were she a devil. Yet have I gold flies from another coast. I dare not say, from the rich cardinal And from the great and new-made Duke of Suffolk, Yet I do find it so. For, to be plain, They, knowing Dame Eleanor’s aspiring humour, Have hired me to undermine the Duchess And buzz these conjurations in her brain. They say “A crafty knave does need no broker”, Yet am I Suffolk and the cardinal’s broker. Hume, if you take not heed, you shall go near To call them both a pair of crafty knaves. Well, so its stands; and thus, I fear, at last Hume’s knavery will be the Duchess’ wrack, And her attainture will be Humphrey’s fall. Sort how it will, I shall have gold for all.  [_Exit._]  SCENE III. London. The palace  Enter Peter and Petitioners.  1 PETITIONER. My masters, let’s stand close. My Lord Protector will come this way by and by, and then we may deliver our supplications in the quill.  2 PETITIONER. Marry, the Lord protect him, for he’s a good man! Jesu bless him!  Enter Suffolk and Queen.  1 PETITIONER. Here he comes, methinks, and the Queen with him. I’ll be the first, sure.  2 PETITIONER. Come back, fool! This is the Duke of Suffolk and not my Lord Protector.  SUFFOLK. How now, fellow; wouldst anything with me?  1 PETITIONER. I pray, my lord, pardon me, I took ye for my Lord Protector.  QUEEN MARGARET. [_Reading_.] “To my Lord Protector.” Are your supplications to his lordship? Let me see them. What is thine?  1 PETITIONER. Mine is, an ’t please your grace, against John Goodman, my Lord Cardinal’s man, for keeping my house and lands, and wife and all, from me.  SUFFOLK. Thy wife too! That’s some wrong, indeed.—What’s yours?—What’s here! [_Reads_.] _Against the Duke of Suffolk for enclosing the commons of Melford._ How now, sir knave!  2 PETITIONER. Alas, sir, I am but a poor petitioner of our whole township.  PETER. [_Giving his petition_.] Against my master, Thomas Horner, for saying that the Duke of York was rightful heir to the crown.  QUEEN MARGARET. What sayst thou? Did the Duke of York say he was rightful heir to the crown?  PETER. That my master was? No, forsooth, my master said that he was, and that the King was an usurper.  SUFFOLK. Who is there?  Enter Servant.  Take this fellow in, and send for his master with a pursuivant presently.—We’ll hear more of your matter before the King.  [_Exit Servant with Peter._]  QUEEN MARGARET. And as for you, that love to be protected Under the wings of our Protector’s grace, Begin your suits anew, and sue to him.  [_Tears the supplications._]  Away, base cullions!—Suffolk, let them go.  ALL. Come, let’s be gone.  [_Exeunt._]  QUEEN MARGARET. My Lord of Suffolk, say, is this the guise, Is this the fashion in the court of England? Is this the government of Britain’s isle, And this the royalty of Albion’s king? What, shall King Henry be a pupil still Under the surly Gloucester’s governance? Am I a queen in title and in style, And must be made a subject to a duke? I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours Thou ran’st atilt in honour of my love And stol’st away the ladies’ hearts of France, I thought King Henry had resembled thee In courage, courtship, and proportion. But all his mind is bent to holiness, To number Ave-Maries on his beads. His champions are the prophets and apostles, His weapons holy saws of sacred writ, His study is his tilt-yard, and his loves Are brazen images of canonized saints. I would the college of the cardinals Would choose him pope and carry him to Rome And set the triple crown upon his head! That were a state fit for his holiness.  SUFFOLK. Madam, be patient. As I was cause Your highness came to England, so will I In England work your grace’s full content.  QUEEN MARGARET. Beside the haughty Protector, have we Beaufort The imperious churchman, Somerset, Buckingham, And grumbling York; and not the least of these But can do more in England than the King.  SUFFOLK. And he of these that can do most of all Cannot do more in England than the Nevilles; Salisbury and Warwick are no simple peers.  QUEEN MARGARET. Not all these lords do vex me half so much As that proud dame, the Lord Protector’s wife. She sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies, More like an empress than Duke Humphrey’s wife. Strangers in court do take her for the Queen. She bears a duke’s revenues on her back, And in her heart she scorns our poverty. Shall I not live to be avenged on her? Contemptuous base-born callet as she is, She vaunted ’mongst her minions t’ other day The very train of her worst wearing gown Was better worth than all my father’s lands Till Suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter.  SUFFOLK. Madam, myself have limed a bush for her And placed a quire of such enticing birds That she will light to listen to the lays And never mount to trouble you again. So let her rest; and, madam, list to me, For I am bold to counsel you in this: Although we fancy not the Cardinal, Yet must we join with him and with the lords Till we have brought Duke Humphrey in disgrace. As for the Duke of York, this late complaint Will make but little for his benefit. So, one by one, we’ll weed them all at last, And you yourself shall steer the happy helm.  Sound a sennet. Enter the King, Gloucester, Cardinal Beaufort, Somerset, Buckingham, Salisbury, York, Warwick and the Duchess of Gloucester.  KING HENRY. For my part, noble lords, I care not which; Or Somerset or York, all’s one to me.  YORK. If York have ill demeaned himself in France, Then let him be denied the regentship.  SOMERSET. If Somerset be unworthy of the place, Let York be regent; I will yield to him.  WARWICK. Whether your Grace be worthy, yea or no, Dispute not that; York is the worthier.  CARDINAL. Ambitious Warwick, let thy betters speak.  WARWICK. The Cardinal’s not my better in the field.  BUCKINGHAM. All in this presence are thy betters, Warwick.  WARWICK. Warwick may live to be the best of all.  SALISBURY. Peace, son!—And show some reason, Buckingham, Why Somerset should be preferred in this.  QUEEN MARGARET. Because the King, forsooth, will have it so.  GLOUCESTER. Madam, the King is old enough himself To give his censure. These are no women’s matters.  QUEEN MARGARET. If he be old enough, what needs your grace To be Protector of his excellence?  GLOUCESTER. Madam, I am Protector of the realm, And at his pleasure will resign my place.  SUFFOLK. Resign it then, and leave thine insolence. Since thou wert king—as who is king but thou?— The commonwealth hath daily run to wrack, The Dauphin hath prevailed beyond the seas, And all the peers and nobles of the realm Have been as bondmen to thy sovereignty.  CARDINAL. The commons hast thou racked; the clergy’s bags Are lank and lean with thy extortions.  SOMERSET. Thy sumptuous buildings and thy wife’s attire Have cost a mass of public treasury.  BUCKINGHAM. Thy cruelty in execution Upon offenders hath exceeded law, And left thee to the mercy of the law.  QUEEN MARGARET. Thy sale of offices and towns in France, If they were known, as the suspect is great, Would make thee quickly hop without thy head.  [_Exit Gloucester. The Queen drops her fan._]  Give me my fan. What minion! Can ye not?  [_She gives the Duchess a box on the ear._]  I cry your mercy, madam; was it you?  ELEANOR. Was’t I! Yea, I it was, proud Frenchwoman. Could I come near your beauty with my nails, I’d set my ten commandments in your face.  KING HENRY. Sweet aunt, be quiet; ’twas against her will.  ELEANOR. Against her will! Good King, look to ’t in time; She’ll hamper thee and dandle thee like a baby. Though in this place most master wear no breeches, She shall not strike Dame Eleanor unrevenged.  [_Exit._]  BUCKINGHAM. Lord Cardinal, I will follow Eleanor, And listen after Humphrey, how he proceeds. She’s tickled now; her fume needs no spurs, She’ll gallop far enough to her destruction.  [_Exit._]  Enter Gloucester.  GLOUCESTER. Now, lords, my choler being overblown With walking once about the quadrangle, I come to talk of commonwealth affairs. As for your spiteful false objections, Prove them, and I lie open to the law; But God in mercy so deal with my soul As I in duty love my king and country! But, to the matter that we have in hand: I say, my sovereign, York is meetest man To be your regent in the realm of France.  SUFFOLK. Before we make election, give me leave To show some reason, of no little force, That York is most unmeet of any man.  YORK. I’ll tell thee, Suffolk, why I am unmeet: First, for I cannot flatter thee in pride; Next, if I be appointed for the place, My Lord of Somerset will keep me here Without discharge, money, or furniture, Till France be won into the Dauphin’s hands. Last time, I danced attendance on his will Till Paris was besieged, famished, and lost.  WARWICK. That can I witness, and a fouler fact Did never traitor in the land commit.  SUFFOLK. Peace, headstrong Warwick!  WARWICK. Image of pride, why should I hold my peace?  Enter Horner the armourer and his man Peter, guarded.  SUFFOLK. Because here is a man accused of treason. Pray God the Duke of York excuse himself!  YORK. Doth anyone accuse York for a traitor?  KING HENRY. What mean’st thou, Suffolk? Tell me, what are these?  SUFFOLK. Please it your majesty, this is the man That doth accuse his master of high treason. His words were these: that Richard, Duke of York Was rightful heir unto the English crown, And that your majesty was an usurper.  KING HENRY. Say, man, were these thy words?  HORNER. An ’t shall please your majesty, I never said nor thought any such matter. God is my witness, I am falsely accused by the villain.  PETER. By these ten bones, my lords, he did speak them to me in the garret one night as we were scouring my Lord of York’s armour.  YORK. Base dunghill villain and mechanical, I’ll have thy head for this thy traitor’s speech!— I do beseech your royal majesty, Let him have all the rigour of the law.  HORNER. Alas, my lord, hang me if ever I spake the words. My accuser is my prentice; and when I did correct him for his fault the other day, he did vow upon his knees he would be even with me. I have good witness of this, therefore I beseech your majesty, do not cast away an honest man for a villain’s accusation.  KING HENRY. Uncle, what shall we say to this in law?  GLOUCESTER. This doom, my lord, if I may judge: Let Somerset be regent o’er the French, Because in York this breeds suspicion; And let these have a day appointed them For single combat in convenient place, For he hath witness of his servant’s malice. This is the law, and this Duke Humphrey’s doom.  SOMERSET. I humbly thank your royal Majesty.  HORNER. And I accept the combat willingly.  PETER. Alas, my lord, I cannot fight; for God’s sake, pity my case! The spite of man prevaileth against me. O Lord, have mercy upon me! I shall never be able to fight a blow. O Lord, my heart!  GLOUCESTER. Sirrah, or you must fight or else be hanged.  KING HENRY. Away with them to prison; and the day Of combat shall be the last of the next month. Come, Somerset, we’ll see thee sent away.  [_Flourish. Exeunt._]  SCENE IV. Gloucester’s Garden  Enter the Witch Margery Jourdain, the two Priests, Hume, Southwell and Bolingbroke.  HUME. Come, my masters. The duchess, I tell you, expects performance of your promises.  BOLINGBROKE. Master Hume, we are therefore provided. Will her ladyship behold and hear our exorcisms?  HUME. Ay, what else? Fear you not her courage.  BOLINGBROKE. I have heard her reported to be a woman of an invincible spirit. But it shall be convenient, Master Hume, that you be by her aloft while we be busy below; and so, I pray you go, in God’s name, and leave us.  [_Exit Hume._]  Mother Jourdain, be you prostrate and grovel on the earth. John Southwell, read you; and let us to our work.  Enter Duchess aloft, Hume following.  ELEANOR. Well said, my masters; and welcome all. To this gear, the sooner the better.  BOLINGBROKE. Patience, good lady; wizards know their times. Deep night, dark night, the silent of the night, The time of night when Troy was set on fire, The time when screech-owls cry and ban-dogs howl, And spirits walk and ghosts break up their graves; That time best fits the work we have in hand. Madam, sit you and fear not. Whom we raise We will make fast within a hallowed verge.  [_Here they do the ceremonies belonging, and make the circle; Bolingbroke or Southwell reads_ “Conjuro te”, _etc. It thunders and lightens terribly; then the Spirit riseth._]  SPIRIT. _Adsum_.  M. JOURDAIN. Asnath, By the eternal God, whose name and power Thou tremblest at, answer that I shall ask; For till thou speak thou shalt not pass from hence.  SPIRIT. Ask what thou wilt. That I had said and done!  BOLINGBROKE. [_Reads_.] _First of the King: what shall of him become?_  SPIRIT. The duke yet lives that Henry shall depose, But him outlive and die a violent death.  [_As the Spirit speaks, Southwell writes the answer._]  BOLINGBROKE. [_Reads_.] _What fates await the Duke of Suffolk?_  SPIRIT. By water shall he die and take his end.  BOLINGBROKE. [_Reads_.] _What shall befall the Duke of Somerset?_  SPIRIT. Let him shun castles. Safer shall he be upon the sandy plains Than where castles mounted stand. Have done, for more I hardly can endure.  BOLINGBROKE. Descend to darkness and the burning lake! False fiend, avoid!  [_Thunder and lightning. Exit Spirit._]  Enter the Duke of York and the Duke of Buckingham with their Guard, and Sir Humphrey Stafford, and break in.  YORK. Lay hands upon these traitors and their trash. Beldam, I think we watched you at an inch. What, madam, are you there? The King and commonweal Are deeply indebted for this piece of pains. My Lord Protector will, I doubt it not, See you well guerdoned for these good deserts.  ELEANOR. Not half so bad as thine to England’s king, Injurious duke, that threatest where’s no cause.  BUCKINGHAM. True, madam, none at all. What call you this? Away with them! Let them be clapped up close And kept asunder.—You, madam, shall with us.— Stafford, take her to thee.  [_Exit Stafford._]  [_Exeunt above, Duchess and Hume, guarded._]  We’ll see your trinkets here all forthcoming. All, away!  [_Exeunt guard with  Jourdain, Southwell, Bolingbroke, etc._]  YORK. Lord Buckingham, methinks you watched her well. A pretty plot, well chosen to build upon! Now, pray, my lord, let’s see the devil’s writ. What have we here? [_Reads_.] _The duke yet lives that Henry shall depose. But him outlive and die a violent death._ Why, this is just _Aio te, Aeacida, Romanos vincere posse._ Well, to the rest: _Tell me what fate awaits the Duke of Suffolk? By water shall he die and take his end. What shall betide the Duke of Somerset? Let him shun castles; Safer shall he be upon the sandy plains Than where castles mounted stand._ Come, come, my lords, these oracles Are hardly attained, and hardly understood. The King is now in progress towards Saint Albans, With him the husband of this lovely lady. Thither go these news as fast as horse can carry them. A sorry breakfast for my Lord Protector.  BUCKINGHAM. Your Grace shall give me leave, my Lord of York, To be the post, in hope of his reward.  YORK. At your pleasure, my good lord.  [_Exit Buckingham._]  Who’s within there, ho!  Enter a Servingman.  Invite my Lords of Salisbury and Warwick To sup with me tomorrow night. Away!  [_Exeunt._]
  ACT II  SCENE I. Saint Albans
Enter the King, Queen, Gloucester, Cardinal and Suffolk with Falconers hallooing.  QUEEN MARGARET. Believe me, lords, for flying at the brook I saw not better sport these seven years’ day; Yet, by your leave, the wind was very high, And, ten to one, old Joan had not gone out.  KING HENRY. But what a point, my lord, your falcon made, And what a pitch she flew above the rest! To see how God in all His creatures works! Yea, man and birds are fain of climbing high.  SUFFOLK. No marvel, an it like your majesty, My Lord Protector’s hawks do tower so well; They know their master loves to be aloft, And bears his thoughts above his falcon’s pitch.  GLOUCESTER. My lord, ’tis but a base ignoble mind That mounts no higher than a bird can soar.  CARDINAL. I thought as much. He would be above the clouds.  GLOUCESTER. Ay, my Lord Cardinal, how think you by that? Were it not good your grace could fly to heaven?  KING HENRY. The treasury of everlasting joy.  CARDINAL. Thy heaven is on earth; thine eyes and thoughts Beat on a crown, the treasure of thy heart, Pernicious Protector, dangerous peer, That smooth’st it so with king and commonweal!  GLOUCESTER. What, cardinal, is your priesthood grown peremptory? _Tantaene animis coelestibus irae?_ Churchmen so hot? Good uncle, hide such malice. With such holiness can you do it?  SUFFOLK. No malice, sir; no more than well becomes So good a quarrel and so bad a peer.  GLOUCESTER. As who, my lord?  SUFFOLK. Why, as you, my lord, An ’t like your lordly Lord Protectorship.  GLOUCESTER. Why, Suffolk, England knows thine insolence.  QUEEN MARGARET. And thy ambition, Gloucester.  KING HENRY. I prithee, peace, good queen, And whet not on these furious peers; For blessed are the peacemakers on earth.  CARDINAL. Let me be blessed for the peace I make Against this proud Protector, with my sword!  GLOUCESTER. [_Aside to Cardinal_.] Faith, holy uncle, would ’twere come to that!  CARDINAL. [_Aside to Gloucester_.] Marry, when thou dar’st.  GLOUCESTER. [_Aside to Cardinal_.] Make up no factious numbers for the matter, In thine own person answer thy abuse.  CARDINAL. [_Aside to Gloucester_.] Ay, where thou dar’st not peep; an if thou dar’st, This evening, on the east side of the grove.  KING HENRY. How now, my lords?  CARDINAL. Believe me, cousin Gloucester, Had not your man put up the fowl so suddenly, We had had more sport.—[_Aside to Gloucester_.] Come with thy two-hand sword.  GLOUCESTER. True, uncle. [_Aside to Cardinal_.] Are ye advised? The east side of the grove?  CARDINAL. [_Aside to Gloucester_.] I am with you.  KING HENRY. Why, how now, uncle Gloucester?  GLOUCESTER. Talking of hawking; nothing else, my lord. [_Aside to Cardinal_.] Now, by God’s mother, priest, I’ll shave your crown for this, Or all my fence shall fail.  CARDINAL. [_Aside to Gloucester_.] _Medice, teipsum._— Protector, see to ’t well, protect yourself.  KING HENRY. The winds grow high; so do your stomachs, lords. How irksome is this music to my heart! When such strings jar, what hope of harmony? I pray, my lords, let me compound this strife.  Enter a Townsman of Saint Albans, crying, “A miracle!”  GLOUCESTER. What means this noise? Fellow, what miracle dost thou proclaim?  TOWNSMAN. A miracle! A miracle!  SUFFOLK. Come to the King, and tell him what miracle.  TOWNSMAN. Forsooth, a blind man at Saint Alban’s shrine, Within this half hour, hath received his sight, A man that ne’er saw in his life before.  KING HENRY. Now, God be praised, that to believing souls Gives light in darkness, comfort in despair!  Enter the Mayor of Saint Albans and his brethren, bearing Simpcox between two in a chair, Simpcox’s Wife following.  CARDINAL. Here comes the townsmen on procession, To present your highness with the man.  KING HENRY. Great is his comfort in this earthly vale, Although by his sight his sin be multiplied.  GLOUCESTER. Stand by, my masters. Bring him near the King. His highness’ pleasure is to talk with him.  KING HENRY. Good fellow, tell us here the circumstance, That we for thee may glorify the Lord. What, hast thou been long blind and now restored?  SIMPCOX. Born blind, an ’t please your grace.  WIFE. Ay, indeed, was he.  SUFFOLK. What woman is this?  WIFE. His wife, an ’t like your worship.  GLOUCESTER. Hadst thou been his mother, thou couldst have better told.  KING HENRY. Where wert thou born?  SIMPCOX. At Berwick in the north, an ’t like your grace.  KING HENRY. Poor soul, God’s goodness hath been great to thee. Let never day nor night unhallowed pass, But still remember what the Lord hath done.  QUEEN MARGARET. Tell me, good fellow, cam’st thou here by chance, Or of devotion, to this holy shrine?  SIMPCOX. God knows, of pure devotion; being called A hundred times and oftener, in my sleep, By good Saint Alban, who said “Simpcox, come, Come, offer at my shrine, and I will help thee.”  WIFE. Most true, forsooth; and many time and oft Myself have heard a voice to call him so.  CARDINAL. What, art thou lame?  SIMPCOX. Ay, God Almighty help me!  SUFFOLK. How cam’st thou so?  SIMPCOX. A fall off of a tree.  WIFE. A plum-tree, master.  GLOUCESTER. How long hast thou been blind?  SIMPCOX. O, born so, master.  GLOUCESTER. What, and wouldst climb a tree?  SIMPCOX. But that in all my life, when I was a youth.  WIFE. Too true; and bought his climbing very dear.  GLOUCESTER. Mass, thou lov’dst plums well, that wouldst venture so.  SIMPCOX. Alas, good master, my wife desired some damsons, And made me climb, with danger of my life.  GLOUCESTER. A subtle knave! But yet it shall not serve.— Let me see thine eyes. Wink now. Now open them. In my opinion yet thou seest not well.  SIMPCOX. Yes, master, clear as day, I thank God and Saint Alban.  GLOUCESTER. Sayst thou me so? What colour is this cloak of?  SIMPCOX. Red, master, red as blood.  GLOUCESTER. Why, that’s well said. What colour is my gown of?  SIMPCOX. Black, forsooth, coal-black as jet.  KING HENRY. Why, then, thou know’st what colour jet is of?  SUFFOLK. And yet, I think, jet did he never see.  GLOUCESTER. But cloaks and gowns before this day, a many.  WIFE. Never before this day in all his life.  GLOUCESTER. Tell me, sirrah, what’s my name?  SIMPCOX. Alas, master, I know not.  GLOUCESTER. What’s his name?  SIMPCOX. I know not.  GLOUCESTER. Nor his?  SIMPCOX. No, indeed, master.  GLOUCESTER. What’s thine own name?  SIMPCOX. Sander Simpcox, an if it please you, master.  GLOUCESTER. Then, Sander, sit there, the lyingest knave in Christendom. If thou hadst been born blind, thou mightst as well have known all our names as thus to name the several colours we do wear. Sight may distinguish of colours; but suddenly to nominate them all, it is impossible.—My lords, Saint Alban here hath done a miracle; and would ye not think his cunning to be great that could restore this cripple to his legs again?  SIMPCOX. O master, that you could!  GLOUCESTER. My masters of Saint Albans, have you not beadles in your town, and things called whips?  MAYOR. Yes, my lord, if it please your grace.  GLOUCESTER. Then send for one presently.  MAYOR. Sirrah, go fetch the beadle hither straight.  [_Exit a Townsman._]  GLOUCESTER. Now fetch me a stool hither by and by.—Now, sirrah, if you mean to save yourself from whipping, leap me over this stool and run away.  SIMPCOX. Alas, master, I am not able to stand alone. You go about to torture me in vain.  Enter a Beadle with whips.  GLOUCESTER. Well, sir, we must have you find your legs. Sirrah beadle, whip him till he leap over that same stool.  BEADLE. I will, my lord.—Come on, sirrah; off with your doublet quickly.  SIMPCOX. Alas, master, what shall I do? I am not able to stand.  [_After the Beadle hath hit him once, he leaps over the stool and runs away; and they follow and cry, “A miracle!”_]  KING HENRY. O God, seest Thou this, and bearest so long?  QUEEN MARGARET. It made me laugh to see the villain run.  GLOUCESTER. Follow the knave, and take this drab away.  WIFE. Alas, sir, we did it for pure need.  GLOUCESTER. Let them be whipped through every market town Till they come to Berwick, from whence they came.  [_Exeunt Wife, Beadle, Mayor, etc._]  CARDINAL. Duke Humphrey has done a miracle today.  SUFFOLK. True, made the lame to leap and fly away.  GLOUCESTER. But you have done more miracles than I. You made in a day, my lord, whole towns to fly.  Enter Buckingham.  KING HENRY. What tidings with our cousin Buckingham?  BUCKINGHAM. Such as my heart doth tremble to unfold. A sort of naughty persons, lewdly bent, Under the countenance and confederacy Of Lady Eleanor, the Protector’s wife, The ringleader and head of all this rout, Have practised dangerously against your state, Dealing with witches and with conjurers, Whom we have apprehended in the fact, Raising up wicked spirits from under ground, Demanding of King Henry’s life and death, And other of your highness’ Privy Council, As more at large your Grace shall understand.  CARDINAL. [_Aside to Gloucester_.] And so, my Lord Protector, by this means Your lady is forthcoming yet at London. This news, I think, hath turned your weapon’s edge; ’Tis like, my lord, you will not keep your hour.  GLOUCESTER. Ambitious churchman, leave to afflict my heart. Sorrow and grief have vanquished all my powers, And, vanquished as I am, I yield to thee, Or to the meanest groom.  KING HENRY. O God, what mischiefs work the wicked ones, Heaping confusion on their own heads thereby!  QUEEN MARGARET. Gloucester, see here the tainture of thy nest, And look thyself be faultless, thou wert best.  GLOUCESTER. Madam, for myself, to heaven I do appeal How I have loved my king and commonweal; And, for my wife, I know not how it stands. Sorry I am to hear what I have heard. Noble she is; but if she have forgot Honour and virtue, and conversed with such As like to pitch defile nobility, I banish her my bed and company And give her as a prey to law and shame That hath dishonoured Gloucester’s honest name.  KING HENRY. Well, for this night we will repose us here; Tomorrow toward London back again, To look into this business thoroughly, And call these foul offenders to their answers, And poise the cause in Justice’ equal scales, Whose beam stands sure, whose rightful cause prevails.  [_Flourish. Exeunt._]  SCENE II. London. The Duke of York’s Garden  Enter York, Salisbury and Warwick.  YORK. Now, my good Lords of Salisbury and Warwick, Our simple supper ended, give me leave In this close walk to satisfy myself In craving your opinion of my title, Which is infallible, to England’s crown.  SALISBURY. My lord, I long to hear it at full.  WARWICK. Sweet York, begin; and if thy claim be good, The Nevilles are thy subjects to command.  YORK. Then thus: Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons: The first, Edward the Black Prince, Prince of Wales; The second, William of Hatfield; and the third, Lionel, Duke of Clarence; next to whom Was John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster; The fifth was Edmund Langley, Duke of York; The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester; William of Windsor was the seventh and last. Edward the Black Prince died before his father And left behind him Richard, his only son, Who after Edward the Third’s death reigned as king, Till Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster, The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt, Crowned by the name of Henry the Fourth, Seized on the realm, deposed the rightful king, Sent his poor queen to France, from whence she came, And him to Pomfret; where, as all you know, Harmless Richard was murdered traitorously.  WARWICK. Father, the Duke hath told the truth; Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown.  YORK. Which now they hold by force and not by right; For Richard, the first son’s heir, being dead, The issue of the next son should have reigned.  SALISBURY. But William of Hatfield died without an heir.  YORK. The third son, Duke of Clarence, from whose line I claim the crown, had issue, Philippa, a daughter, Who married Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March. Edmund had issue, Roger, Earl of March; Roger had issue, Edmund, Anne, and Eleanor.  SALISBURY. This Edmund, in the reign of Bolingbroke, As I have read, laid claim unto the crown And, but for Owen Glendower, had been king, Who kept him in captivity till he died. But to the rest.  YORK. His eldest sister, Anne, My mother, being heir unto the crown, Married Richard Earl of Cambridge, who was son To Edmund Langley, Edward the Third’s fifth son. By her I claim the kingdom; she was heir To Roger, Earl of March, who was the son Of Edmund Mortimer, who married Philippa, Sole daughter unto Lionel, Duke of Clarence. So, if the issue of the elder son Succeed before the younger, I am king.  WARWICK. What plain proceeding is more plain than this? Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt, The fourth son; York claims it from the third. Till Lionel’s issue fails, his should not reign; It fails not yet, but flourishes in thee And in thy sons, fair slips of such a stock. Then, father Salisbury, kneel we together, And in this private plot be we the first That shall salute our rightful sovereign With honour of his birthright to the crown.  BOTH. Long live our sovereign Richard, England’s king!  YORK. We thank you, lords. But I am not your king Till I be crowned, and that my sword be stained With heart-blood of the house of Lancaster; And that’s not suddenly to be performed, But with advice and silent secrecy. Do you as I do in these dangerous days— Wink at the Duke of Suffolk’s insolence, At Beaufort’s pride, at Somerset’s ambition, At Buckingham, and all the crew of them, Till they have snared the shepherd of the flock, That virtuous prince, the good Duke Humphrey. ’Tis that they seek; and they, in seeking that, Shall find their deaths, if York can prophesy.  SALISBURY. My lord, break we off; we know your mind at full.  WARWICK. My heart assures me that the Earl of Warwick Shall one day make the Duke of York a king.  YORK. And, Neville, this I do assure myself: Richard shall live to make the Earl of Warwick The greatest man in England but the king.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. A Hall of Justice  Sound trumpets. Enter the King, the Queen, Gloucester, York, Suffolk and Salisbury; the Duchess of Gloucester, Margery Jourdain, Southwell, Hume and Bolingbroke under guard.  KING HENRY. Stand forth, Dame Eleanor Cobham, Gloucester’s wife. In sight of God and us, your guilt is great; Receive the sentence of the law for sins Such as by God’s book are adjudged to death. You four, from hence to prison back again; From thence unto the place of execution. The witch in Smithfield shall be burnt to ashes, And you three shall be strangled on the gallows. You, madam, for you are more nobly born, Despoiled of your honour in your life, Shall, after three days’ open penance done, Live in your country here in banishment, With Sir John Stanley in the Isle of Man.  ELEANOR. Welcome is banishment; welcome were my death.  GLOUCESTER. Eleanor, the law, thou seest, hath judged thee. I cannot justify whom the law condemns.  [_Exeunt Duchess and the other prisoners, guarded._]  Mine eyes are full of tears, my heart of grief. Ah, Humphrey, this dishonour in thine age Will bring thy head with sorrow to the ground!— I beseech your majesty, give me leave to go; Sorrow would solace, and mine age would ease.  KING HENRY. Stay, Humphrey Duke of Gloucester. Ere thou go, Give up thy staff. Henry will to himself Protector be; and God shall be my hope, My stay, my guide, and lantern to my feet. And go in peace, Humphrey, no less beloved Than when thou wert Protector to thy king.  QUEEN MARGARET. I see no reason why a king of years Should be to be protected like a child. God and King Henry govern England’s realm! Give up your staff, sir, and the King his realm.  GLOUCESTER. My staff? Here, noble Henry, is my staff. As willingly do I the same resign As e’er thy father Henry made it mine; And even as willingly at thy feet I leave it As others would ambitiously receive it. Farewell, good King. When I am dead and gone, May honourable peace attend thy throne.  [_Exit._]  QUEEN MARGARET. Why, now is Henry King and Margaret Queen, And Humphrey Duke of Gloucester scarce himself, That bears so shrewd a maim. Two pulls at once; His lady banished, and a limb lopped off. This staff of honour raught, there let it stand Where it best fits to be, in Henry’s hand.  SUFFOLK. Thus droops this lofty pine and hangs his sprays; Thus Eleanor’s pride dies in her youngest days.  YORK. Lords, let him go.—Please it your majesty, This is the day appointed for the combat, And ready are the appellant and defendant, The armourer and his man, to enter the lists, So please your highness to behold the fight.  QUEEN MARGARET. Ay, good my lord; for purposely therefore Left I the court to see this quarrel tried.  KING HENRY. I’ God’s name, see the lists and all things fit. Here let them end it, and God defend the right!  YORK. I never saw a fellow worse bested, Or more afraid to fight, than is the appellant, The servant of his armourer, my lords.  Enter at one door Horner the armourer, and his Neighbours, drinking to him so much that he is drunk; and he enters with a drum before him and his staff with a sandbag fastened to it; and at the other door Peter, his man, with a drum and sandbag, and Prentices  drinking to him.  1 NEIGHBOUR. Here, neighbour Horner, I drink to you in a cup of sack; and fear not, neighbour, you shall do well enough.  2 NEIGHBOUR. And here, neighbour, here’s a cup of charneco.  3 NEIGHBOUR. And here’s a pot of good double beer, neighbour. Drink, and fear not your man.  HORNER. Let it come, i’ faith, and I’ll pledge you all; and a fig for Peter!  1 PRENTICE. Here, Peter, I drink to thee, and be not afraid.  2 PRENTICE. Be merry, Peter, and fear not thy master. Fight for credit of the prentices.  PETER. I thank you all. Drink, and pray for me, I pray you, for I think I have taken my last draught in this world. Here, Robin, an if I die, I give thee my apron; and, Will, thou shalt have my hammer; and here, Tom, take all the money that I have. O Lord bless me! I pray God, for I am never able to deal with my master, he hath learnt so much fence already.  SALISBURY. Come, leave your drinking and fall to blows. Sirrah, what’s thy name?  PETER. Peter, forsooth.  SALISBURY. Peter? What more?  PETER. Thump.  SALISBURY. Thump! Then see thou thump thy master well.  HORNER. Masters, I am come hither, as it were, upon my man’s instigation, to prove him a knave and myself an honest man; and touching the Duke of York, I will take my death I never meant him any ill, nor the King, nor the Queen; and therefore, Peter, have at thee with a downright blow!  YORK. Dispatch! This knave’s tongue begins to double. Sound, trumpets. Alarum to the combatants!  [_They fight, and Peter strikes him down._]  HORNER. Hold, Peter, hold! I confess, I confess treason.  [_Dies._]  YORK. Take away his weapon.—Fellow, thank God and the good wine in thy master’s way.  PETER. O God, have I overcome mine enemies in this presence? O Peter, thou hast prevailed in right!  KING HENRY. Go, take hence that traitor from our sight, For by his death we do perceive his guilt. And God in justice hath revealed to us The truth and innocence of this poor fellow, Which he had thought to have murdered wrongfully. Come, fellow, follow us for thy reward.  [_Sound a flourish. Exeunt._]  SCENE IV. A Street  Enter Gloucester and his Servingmen in mourning cloaks.  GLOUCESTER. Thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud, And after summer evermore succeeds Barren winter, with his wrathful nipping cold; So cares and joys abound, as seasons fleet. Sirs, what’s o’clock?  SERVINGMEN. Ten, my lord.  GLOUCESTER. Ten is the hour that was appointed me To watch the coming of my punished duchess. Uneath may she endure the flinty streets, To tread them with her tender-feeling feet. Sweet Nell, ill can thy noble mind abrook The abject people gazing on thy face With envious looks, laughing at thy shame, That erst did follow thy proud chariot wheels When thou didst ride in triumph through the streets. But, soft! I think she comes; and I’ll prepare My tear-stained eyes to see her miseries.  Enter the Duchess of Gloucester in a white sheet, and a taper burning in her hand; with Sir John Stanley, the Sheriff, and Officers.  SERVINGMEN. So please your Grace, we’ll take her from the sheriff.  GLOUCESTER. No, stir not for your lives; let her pass by.  ELEANOR. Come you, my lord, to see my open shame? Now thou dost penance too. Look how they gaze! See how the giddy multitude do point, And nod their heads, and throw their eyes on thee. Ah, Gloucester, hide thee from their hateful looks, And, in thy closet pent up, rue my shame, And ban thine enemies, both mine and thine!  GLOUCESTER. Be patient, gentle Nell, forget this grief.  ELEANOR. Ah, Gloucester, teach me to forget myself! For whilst I think I am thy married wife And thou a prince, Protector of this land, Methinks I should not thus be led along, Mailed up in shame, with papers on my back, And followed with a rabble that rejoice To see my tears and hear my deep-fet groans. The ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet, And when I start, the envious people laugh And bid me be advised how I tread. Ah, Humphrey, can I bear this shameful yoke? Trowest thou that e’er I’ll look upon the world, Or count them happy that enjoy the sun? No, dark shall be my light and night my day; To think upon my pomp shall be my hell. Sometimes I’ll say, I am Duke Humphrey’s wife, And he a prince and ruler of the land; Yet so he ruled and such a prince he was As he stood by whilst I, his forlorn duchess, Was made a wonder and a pointing-stock To every idle rascal follower. But be thou mild and blush not at my shame, Nor stir at nothing till the axe of death Hang over thee, as, sure, it shortly will. For Suffolk, he that can do all in all With her that hateth thee and hates us all, And York and impious Beaufort, that false priest, Have all limed bushes to betray thy wings; And fly thou how thou canst, they’ll tangle thee. But fear not thou until thy foot be snared, Nor never seek prevention of thy foes.  GLOUCESTER. Ah, Nell, forbear! Thou aimest all awry. I must offend before I be attainted; And had I twenty times so many foes, And each of them had twenty times their power, All these could not procure me any scathe So long as I am loyal, true, and crimeless. Wouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach? Why, yet thy scandal were not wiped away, But I in danger for the breach of law. Thy greatest help is quiet, gentle Nell. I pray thee, sort thy heart to patience; These few days’ wonder will be quickly worn.  Enter a Herald.  HERALD. I summon your grace to his majesty’s parliament, Holden at Bury the first of this next month.  GLOUCESTER. And my consent ne’er asked herein before? This is close dealing. Well, I will be there.  [_Exit Herald._]  My Nell, I take my leave; and, master sheriff, Let not her penance exceed the King’s commission.  SHERIFF. An ’t please your grace, here my commission stays, And Sir John Stanley is appointed now To take her with him to the Isle of Man.  GLOUCESTER. Must you, Sir John, protect my lady here?  STANLEY. So am I given in charge, may ’t please your grace.  GLOUCESTER. Entreat her not the worse in that I pray You use her well. The world may laugh again, And I may live to do you kindness if You do it her. And so, Sir John, farewell.  ELEANOR. What, gone, my lord, and bid me not farewell?  GLOUCESTER. Witness my tears, I cannot stay to speak.  [_Exeunt Gloucester and Servingmen._]  ELEANOR. Art thou gone too? All comfort go with thee, For none abides with me; my joy is death; Death, at whose name I oft have been afeard, Because I wished this world’s eternity. Stanley, I prithee, go, and take me hence, I care not whither, for I beg no favour, Only convey me where thou art commanded.  STANLEY. Why, madam, that is to the Isle of Man, There to be used according to your state.  ELEANOR. That’s bad enough, for I am but reproach; And shall I then be used reproachfully?  STANLEY. Like to a duchess, and Duke Humphrey’s lady; According to that state you shall be used.  ELEANOR. Sheriff, farewell, and better than I fare, Although thou hast been conduct of my shame.  SHERIFF. It is my office; and, madam, pardon me.  ELEANOR. Ay, ay, farewell; thy office is discharged. Come, Stanley, shall we go?  STANLEY. Madam, your penance done, throw off this sheet, And go we to attire you for our journey.  ELEANOR. My shame will not be shifted with my sheet, No, it will hang upon my richest robes And show itself, attire me how I can. Go, lead the way, I long to see my prison.  [_Exeunt._]
  ACT III  SCENE I. The Abbey at Bury St. Edmund’s
  ACT IV  SCENE I. The Coast of Kent
  ACT V  SCENE I. Fields between Dartford and Blackheath
Enter York and his army of Irish, with drum and colours.  YORK. From Ireland thus comes York to claim his right And pluck the crown from feeble Henry’s head. Ring, bells, aloud; burn, bonfires, clear and bright, To entertain great England’s lawful king. Ah, _sancta majestas_, who would not buy thee dear? Let them obey that knows not how to rule. This hand was made to handle nought but gold. I cannot give due action to my words Except a sword or sceptre balance it. A sceptre shall it have, have I a soul, On which I’ll toss the fleur-de-luce of France.  Enter Buckingham.  Whom have we here? Buckingham, to disturb me? The King hath sent him, sure. I must dissemble.  BUCKINGHAM. York, if thou meanest well, I greet thee well.  YORK. Humphrey of Buckingham, I accept thy greeting. Art thou a messenger, or come of pleasure?  BUCKINGHAM. A messenger from Henry, our dread liege, To know the reason of these arms in peace; Or why thou, being a subject as I am, Against thy oath and true allegiance sworn, Should raise so great a power without his leave, Or dare to bring thy force so near the court.  YORK. [_Aside_.] Scarce can I speak, my choler is so great. O, I could hew up rocks and fight with flint, I am so angry at these abject terms; And now, like Ajax Telamonius, On sheep or oxen could I spend my fury. I am far better born than is the King, More like a king, more kingly in my thoughts. But I must make fair weather yet awhile, Till Henry be more weak and I more strong.— Buckingham, I prithee, pardon me, That I have given no answer all this while; My mind was troubled with deep melancholy. The cause why I have brought this army hither Is to remove proud Somerset from the King, Seditious to his grace and to the state.  BUCKINGHAM. That is too much presumption on thy part; But if thy arms be to no other end, The King hath yielded unto thy demand: The Duke of Somerset is in the Tower.  YORK. Upon thine honour, is he prisoner?  BUCKINGHAM. Upon mine honour, he is prisoner.  YORK. Then, Buckingham, I do dismiss my powers. Soldiers, I thank you all; disperse yourselves; Meet me tomorrow in Saint George’s field, You shall have pay and everything you wish.  [_Exeunt Soldiers._]  And let my sovereign, virtuous Henry, Command my eldest son, nay, all my sons, As pledges of my fealty and love, I’ll send them all as willing as I live. Lands, goods, horse, armour, anything I have Is his to use, so Somerset may die.  BUCKINGHAM. York, I commend this kind submission. We twain will go into his highness’ tent.  Enter King and Attendants.  KING HENRY. Buckingham, doth York intend no harm to us That thus he marcheth with thee arm in arm?  YORK. In all submission and humility York doth present himself unto your highness.  KING HENRY. Then what intends these forces thou dost bring?  YORK. To heave the traitor Somerset from hence And fight against that monstrous rebel Cade, Who since I heard to be discomfited.  Enter Iden with Cade’s head.  IDEN. If one so rude and of so mean condition May pass into the presence of a king, Lo, I present your grace a traitor’s head, The head of Cade, whom I in combat slew.  KING HENRY. The head of Cade! Great God, how just art Thou! O, let me view his visage, being dead, That living wrought me such exceeding trouble. Tell me, my friend, art thou the man that slew him?  IDEN. I was, an ’t like your majesty.  KING HENRY. How art thou called? And what is thy degree?  IDEN. Alexander Iden, that’s my name; A poor esquire of Kent, that loves his King.  BUCKINGHAM. So please it you, my lord, ’twere not amiss He were created knight for his good service.  KING HENRY. Iden, kneel down. [_He kneels_.] Rise up a knight. We give thee for reward a thousand marks, And will that thou henceforth attend on us.  IDEN. May Iden live to merit such a bounty, And never live but true unto his liege!  [_Rises._]  Enter Queen and Somerset.  KING HENRY. See, Buckingham, Somerset comes with the Queen. Go, bid her hide him quickly from the Duke.  QUEEN MARGARET. For thousand Yorks he shall not hide his head, But boldly stand and front him to his face.  YORK. How now? Is Somerset at liberty? Then, York, unloose thy long-imprisoned thoughts, And let thy tongue be equal with thy heart. Shall I endure the sight of Somerset? False king, why hast thou broken faith with me, Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse? “King” did I call thee? No, thou art not king, Not fit to govern and rule multitudes, Which dar’st not, no, nor canst not rule a traitor. That head of thine doth not become a crown; Thy hand is made to grasp a palmer’s staff, And not to grace an awful princely sceptre. That gold must round engirt these brows of mine, Whose smile and frown, like to Achilles’ spear, Is able with the change to kill and cure. Here is a hand to hold a sceptre up And with the same to act controlling laws. Give place! By heaven, thou shalt rule no more O’er him whom heaven created for thy ruler.  SOMERSET. O monstrous traitor! I arrest thee, York, Of capital treason ’gainst the King and crown. Obey, audacious traitor, kneel for grace.  YORK. Wouldst have me kneel? First let me ask of these If they can brook I bow a knee to man. Sirrah, call in my sons to be my bail.  [_Exit Attendant._]  I know, ere they will have me go to ward, They’ll pawn their swords for my enfranchisement.  QUEEN MARGARET. Call hither Clifford; bid him come amain, To say if that the bastard boys of York Shall be the surety for their traitor father.  [_Exit Buckingham._]  YORK. O blood-bespotted Neapolitan, Outcast of Naples, England’s bloody scourge! The sons of York, thy betters in their birth, Shall be their father’s bail; and bane to those That for my surety will refuse the boys!  Enter Edward and Richard.  See where they come; I’ll warrant they’ll make it good.  Enter old Clifford and his Son.  QUEEN MARGARET. And here comes Clifford to deny their bail.  CLIFFORD. Health and all happiness to my lord the King.  [_Rises._]  YORK. I thank thee, Clifford. Say, what news with thee? Nay, do not fright us with an angry look. We are thy sovereign, Clifford, kneel again. For thy mistaking so, we pardon thee.  CLIFFORD. This is my king, York, I do not mistake; But thou mistakes me much to think I do. To Bedlam with him! Is the man grown mad?  KING HENRY. Ay, Clifford; a bedlam and ambitious humour Makes him oppose himself against his king.  CLIFFORD. He is a traitor; let him to the Tower, And chop away that factious pate of his.  QUEEN MARGARET. He is arrested, but will not obey; His sons, he says, shall give their words for him.  YORK. Will you not, sons?  EDWARD. Ay, noble father, if our words will serve.  RICHARD. And if words will not, then our weapons shall.  CLIFFORD. Why, what a brood of traitors have we here!  YORK. Look in a glass, and call thy image so. I am thy king, and thou a false-heart traitor. Call hither to the stake my two brave bears, That with the very shaking of their chains They may astonish these fell-lurking curs. Bid Salisbury and Warwick come to me.  Enter the Earls of Warwick and Salisbury.  CLIFFORD. Are these thy bears? We’ll bait thy bears to death And manacle the bearherd in their chains, If thou dar’st bring them to the baiting-place.  RICHARD. Oft have I seen a hot o’erweening cur Run back and bite because he was withheld, Who, being suffered with the bear’s fell paw, Hath clapped his tail between his legs and cried; And such a piece of service will you do If you oppose yourselves to match Lord Warwick.  CLIFFORD. Hence, heap of wrath, foul indigested lump, As crooked in thy manners as thy shape!  YORK. Nay, we shall heat you thoroughly anon.  CLIFFORD. Take heed, lest by your heat you burn yourselves.  KING HENRY. Why, Warwick, hath thy knee forgot to bow? Old Salisbury, shame to thy silver hair, Thou mad misleader of thy brainsick son! What, wilt thou on thy deathbed play the ruffian, And seek for sorrow with thy spectacles? O, where is faith? O, where is loyalty? If it be banished from the frosty head, Where shall it find a harbour in the earth? Wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war, And shame thine honourable age with blood? Why art thou old, and want’st experience? Or wherefore dost abuse it, if thou hast it? For shame, in duty bend thy knee to me That bows unto the grave with mickle age.  SALISBURY. My lord, I have considered with myself The title of this most renowned duke, And in my conscience do repute his grace The rightful heir to England’s royal seat.  KING HENRY. Hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me?  SALISBURY. I have.  KING HENRY. Canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath?  SALISBURY. It is great sin to swear unto a sin, But greater sin to keep a sinful oath. Who can be bound by any solemn vow To do a murderous deed, to rob a man, To force a spotless virgin’s chastity, To reave the orphan of his patrimony, To wring the widow from her customed right, And have no other reason for this wrong But that he was bound by a solemn oath?  QUEEN MARGARET. A subtle traitor needs no sophister.  KING HENRY. Call Buckingham, and bid him arm himself.  YORK. Call Buckingham, and all the friends thou hast, I am resolved for death or dignity.  CLIFFORD. The first I warrant thee, if dreams prove true.  WARWICK. You were best to go to bed and dream again, To keep thee from the tempest of the field.  CLIFFORD. I am resolved to bear a greater storm Than any thou canst conjure up today; And that I’ll write upon thy burgonet, Might I but know thee by thy household badge.  WARWICK. Now, by my father’s badge, old Neville’s crest, The rampant bear chained to the ragged staff, This day I’ll wear aloft my burgonet, As on a mountain top the cedar shows That keeps his leaves in spite of any storm, Even to affright thee with the view thereof.  CLIFFORD. And from thy burgonet I’ll rend thy bear And tread it under foot with all contempt, Despite the bearherd that protects the bear.  YOUNG CLIFFORD. And so to arms, victorious father, To quell the rebels and their complices.  RICHARD. Fie, charity, for shame! Speak not in spite, For you shall sup with Jesu Christ tonight.  YOUNG CLIFFORD. Foul stigmatic, that’s more than thou canst tell.  RICHARD. If not in heaven, you’ll surely sup in hell.  [_Exeunt severally._]  SCENE II. Saint Albans  The sign of the Castle Inn is displayed. Alarums to the battle. Enter Warwick.  WARWICK. Clifford of Cumberland, ’tis Warwick calls; An if thou dost not hide thee from the bear, Now, when the angry trumpet sounds alarum And dead men’s cries do fill the empty air, Clifford, I say, come forth and fight with me! Proud northern lord, Clifford of Cumberland, Warwick is hoarse with calling thee to arms.  Enter York.  How now, my noble lord? What, all afoot?  YORK. The deadly-handed Clifford slew my steed, But match to match I have encountered him And made a prey for carrion kites and crows Even of the bonny beast he loved so well.  Enter old Clifford.  WARWICK. Of one or both of us the time is come.  YORK. Hold, Warwick, seek thee out some other chase, For I myself must hunt this deer to death.  WARWICK. Then, nobly, York; ’tis for a crown thou fight’st. As I intend, Clifford, to thrive today, It grieves my soul to leave thee unassailed.  [_Exit._]  CLIFFORD. What seest thou in me, York? Why dost thou pause?  YORK. With thy brave bearing should I be in love, But that thou art so fast mine enemy.  CLIFFORD. Nor should thy prowess want praise and esteem, But that ’tis shown ignobly and in treason.  YORK. So let it help me now against thy sword As I in justice and true right express it!  CLIFFORD. My soul and body on the action both!  YORK. A dreadful lay! Address thee instantly.  [_They fight and Clifford falls._]  CLIFFORD. _La fin couronne les oeuvres._  [_Dies._]  YORK. Thus war hath given thee peace, for thou art still. Peace with his soul, heaven, if it be thy will!  [_Exit._]  Enter young Clifford.  YOUNG CLIFFORD. Shame and confusion! All is on the rout, Fear frames disorder, and disorder wounds Where it should guard. O war, thou son of hell, Whom angry heavens do make their minister, Throw in the frozen bosoms of our part Hot coals of vengeance! Let no soldier fly. He that is truly dedicate to war Hath no self-love; nor he that loves himself Hath not essentially but by circumstance, The name of valour. [_Sees his dead father_.] O, let the vile world end And the premised flames of the last day Knit earth and heaven together! Now let the general trumpet blow his blast, Particularities and petty sounds To cease! Wast thou ordained, dear father, To lose thy youth in peace, and to achieve The silver livery of advised age, And, in thy reverence and thy chair-days, thus To die in ruffian battle? Even at this sight My heart is turned to stone, and while ’tis mine It shall be stony. York not our old men spares; No more will I their babes; tears virginal Shall be to me even as the dew to fire, And beauty, that the tyrant oft reclaims, Shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax. Henceforth I will not have to do with pity. Meet I an infant of the house of York, Into as many gobbets will I cut it As wild Medea young Absyrtus did. In cruelty will I seek out my fame.  [_He takes him up on his back._]  Come, thou new ruin of old Clifford’s house; As did Aeneas old Anchises bear, So bear I thee upon my manly shoulders; But then Aeneas bare a living load, Nothing so heavy as these woes of mine.  [_Exit, bearing off his father._]  Enter Richard and Somerset to fight. Somerset is killed.  RICHARD. So, lie thou there; For underneath an alehouse’ paltry sign, The Castle in Saint Albans, Somerset Hath made the wizard famous in his death. Sword, hold thy temper; heart, be wrathful still! Priests pray for enemies, but princes kill.  [_Exit._]  Fight. Excursions. Enter King, Queen and others.  QUEEN MARGARET. Away, my lord! You are slow, for shame, away!  KING HENRY. Can we outrun the heavens? Good Margaret, stay.  QUEEN MARGARET. What are you made of? You’ll nor fight nor fly. Now is it manhood, wisdom, and defence To give the enemy way, and to secure us By what we can, which can no more but fly.  [_Alarum afar off._]  If you be ta’en, we then should see the bottom Of all our fortunes; but if we haply scape, As well we may, if not through your neglect, We shall to London get, where you are loved And where this breach now in our fortunes made May readily be stopped.  Enter young Clifford.  YOUNG CLIFFORD. But that my heart’s on future mischief set, I would speak blasphemy ere bid you fly; But fly you must; uncurable discomfit Reigns in the hearts of all our present parts. Away, for your relief! And we will live To see their day and them our fortune give. Away, my lord, away!  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. Fields near Saint Albans  Alarum. Retreat. Enter York, Richard, Warwick and Soldiers with drum and colours.  YORK. Of Salisbury, who can report of him, That winter lion, who in rage forgets Aged contusions and all brush of time, And, like a gallant in the brow of youth, Repairs him with occasion? This happy day Is not itself, nor have we won one foot, If Salisbury be lost.  RICHARD. My noble father, Three times today I holp him to his horse, Three times bestrid him; thrice I led him off, Persuaded him from any further act; But still, where danger was, still there I met him, And like rich hangings in a homely house, So was his will in his old feeble body. But, noble as he is, look where he comes.  Enter Salisbury.  Now, by my sword, well hast thou fought today.  SALISBURY. By th’ mass, so did we all. I thank you, Richard. God knows how long it is I have to live, And it hath pleased him that three times today You have defended me from imminent death. Well, lords, we have not got that which we have; ’Tis not enough our foes are this time fled, Being opposites of such repairing nature.  YORK. I know our safety is to follow them; For, as I hear, the King is fled to London To call a present court of parliament. Let us pursue him ere the writs go forth. What says Lord Warwick? Shall we after them?  WARWICK. After them? Nay, before them, if we can. Now, by my hand, lords, ’twas a glorious day. Saint Albans battle won by famous York Shall be eternized in all age to come. Sound drums and trumpets, and to London all; And more such days as these to us befall!  [_Exeunt._]

Enter Richard (Duke of Gloucester), George (Duke of Clarence), Somerset and Montague.  RICHARD. Now tell me, brother Clarence, what think you Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey? Hath not our brother made a worthy choice?  GEORGE. Alas, you know ’tis far from hence to France! How could he stay till Warwick made return?  SOMERSET. My lords, forbear this talk; here comes the King.  Flourish. Enter King Edward, attended; Lady Grey as Queen Elizabeth; Pembroke, Stafford, Hastings and others. Four stand on one side, and four on the other.  RICHARD. And his well-chosen bride.  GEORGE. I mind to tell him plainly what I think.  KING EDWARD. Now, brother of Clarence, how like you our choice, That you stand pensive as half malcontent?  GEORGE. As well as Lewis of France or the Earl of Warwick, Which are so weak of courage and in judgment That they’ll take no offence at our abuse.  KING EDWARD. Suppose they take offence without a cause, They are but Lewis and Warwick; I am Edward, Your King and Warwick’s, and must have my will.  RICHARD. And shall have your will, because our King. Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well.  KING EDWARD. Yea, brother Richard, are you offended too?  RICHARD. Not I. No, God forbid that I should wish them severed Whom God hath joined together. Ay, and ’twere pity To sunder them that yoke so well together.  KING EDWARD. Setting your scorns and your mislike aside, Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey Should not become my wife and England’s queen. And you too, Somerset and Montague, Speak freely what you think.  GEORGE. Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis Becomes your enemy for mocking him About the marriage of the Lady Bona.  RICHARD. And Warwick, doing what you gave in charge, Is now dishonoured by this new marriage.  KING EDWARD. What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeased By such invention as I can devise?  MONTAGUE. Yet to have joined with France in such alliance Would more have strengthened this our commonwealth ’Gainst foreign storms than any home-bred marriage.  HASTINGS. Why, knows not Montague that of itself England is safe, if true within itself?  MONTAGUE. But the safer when ’tis backed with France.  HASTINGS. ’Tis better using France than trusting France. Let us be backed with God and with the seas Which He hath giv’n for fence impregnable, And with their helps only defend ourselves. In them and in ourselves our safety lies.  GEORGE. For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford.  KING EDWARD. Ay, what of that? It was my will and grant; And for this once my will shall stand for law.  RICHARD. And yet, methinks, your Grace hath not done well To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales Unto the brother of your loving bride. She better would have fitted me or Clarence; But in your bride you bury brotherhood.  GEORGE. Or else you would not have bestowed the heir Of the Lord Bonville on your new wife’s son, And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere.  KING EDWARD. Alas, poor Clarence, is it for a wife That thou art malcontent? I will provide thee.  GEORGE. In choosing for yourself you showed your judgment, Which being shallow, you shall give me leave To play the broker in mine own behalf; And to that end I shortly mind to leave you.  KING EDWARD. Leave me or tarry, Edward will be king, And not be tied unto his brother’s will.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. My lords, before it pleased his Majesty To raise my state to title of a queen, Do me but right, and you must all confess That I was not ignoble of descent, And meaner than myself have had like fortune. But as this title honours me and mine, So your dislikes, to whom I would be pleasing, Doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow.  KING EDWARD. My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns. What danger or what sorrow can befall thee So long as Edward is thy constant friend And their true sovereign, whom they must obey? Nay, whom they shall obey, and love thee too, Unless they seek for hatred at my hands; Which if they do, yet will I keep thee safe, And they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath.  RICHARD. [_Aside_.] I hear, yet say not much, but think the more.  Enter a Post.  KING EDWARD. Now, messenger, what letters or what news From France?  POST. My sovereign liege, no letters, and few words, But such as I, without your special pardon, Dare not relate.  KING EDWARD. Go to, we pardon thee. Therefore, in brief, Tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them. What answer makes King Lewis unto our letters?  POST. At my depart these were his very words: “Go tell false Edward, thy supposed king, That Lewis of France is sending over maskers To revel it with him and his new bride.”  KING EDWARD. Is Lewis so brave? Belike he thinks me Henry. But what said Lady Bona to my marriage?  POST. These were her words, uttered with mild disdain: “Tell him, in hope he’ll prove a widower shortly, I’ll wear the willow garland for his sake.”  KING EDWARD. I blame not her; she could say little less; She had the wrong. But what said Henry’s queen? For I have heard that she was there in place.  POST. “Tell him,” quoth she “my mourning weeds are done, And I am ready to put armour on.”  KING EDWARD. Belike she minds to play the Amazon. But what said Warwick to these injuries?  POST. He, more incensed against your Majesty Than all the rest, discharged me with these words: “Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong, And therefore I’ll uncrown him ere ’t be long.”  KING EDWARD. Ha! Durst the traitor breathe out so proud words? Well, I will arm me, being thus forewarned. They shall have wars and pay for their presumption. But say, is Warwick friends with Margaret?  POST. Ay, gracious sovereign, they are so linked in friendship That young Prince Edward marries Warwick’s daughter.  GEORGE. Belike the elder; Clarence will have the younger. Now, brother king, farewell, and sit you fast, For I will hence to Warwick’s other daughter; That, though I want a kingdom, yet in marriage I may not prove inferior to yourself. You that love me and Warwick, follow me.  [_Exit George and Somerset follows._]  RICHARD. [_Aside_.] Not I. My thoughts aim at a further matter; I stay not for the love of Edward, but the crown.  KING EDWARD. Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick! Yet am I armed against the worst can happen, And haste is needful in this desperate case. Pembroke and Stafford, you in our behalf Go levy men and make prepare for war; They are already, or quickly will be, landed. Myself in person will straight follow you.  [_Exeunt Pembroke and Stafford._]  But, ere I go, Hastings and Montague, Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest, Are near to Warwick by blood and by alliance. Tell me if you love Warwick more than me. If it be so, then both depart to him. I rather wish you foes than hollow friends. But if you mind to hold your true obedience, Give me assurance with some friendly vow, That I may never have you in suspect.  MONTAGUE. So God help Montague as he proves true!  HASTINGS. And Hastings as he favours Edward’s cause!  KING EDWARD. Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us?  RICHARD. Ay, in despite of all that shall withstand you.  KING EDWARD. Why, so! Then am I sure of victory. Now, therefore, let us hence, and lose no hour Till we meet Warwick with his foreign power.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. A Plain in Warwickshire  Enter Warwick and Oxford in England, with French Soldiers.  WARWICK. Trust me, my lord, all hitherto goes well; The common people by numbers swarm to us.  Enter George (Duke of Clarence) and Somerset.  But see where Somerset and Clarence comes. Speak suddenly, my lords: are we all friends?  GEORGE. Fear not that, my lord.  WARWICK. Then, gentle Clarence, welcome unto Warwick; And welcome, Somerset. I hold it cowardice To rest mistrustful where a noble heart Hath pawned an open hand in sign of love; Else might I think that Clarence, Edward’s brother, Were but a feigned friend to our proceedings. But welcome, sweet Clarence; my daughter shall be thine. And now what rests but, in night’s coverture, Thy brother being carelessly encamped, His soldiers lurking in the towns about, And but attended by a simple guard, We may surprise and take him at our pleasure? Our scouts have found the adventure very easy; That, as Ulysses and stout Diomede With sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus’ tents, And brought from thence the Thracian fatal steeds, So we, well covered with the night’s black mantle, At unawares may beat down Edward’s guard, And seize himself. I say not, slaughter him, For I intend but only to surprise him. You that will follow me to this attempt, Applaud the name of Henry with your leader.  [_They all cry “Henry!”_]  Why then, let’s on our way in silent sort, For Warwick and his friends, God and Saint George!  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. Edward’s Camp near Warwick  Enter three Watchmen to guard the King’s tent.  1 WATCHMAN. Come on, my masters, each man take his stand. The King by this is set him down to sleep.  2 WATCHMAN. What, will he not to bed?  1 WATCHMAN. Why, no; for he hath made a solemn vow Never to lie and take his natural rest Till Warwick or himself be quite suppressed.  2 WATCHMAN. Tomorrow, then, belike shall be the day, If Warwick be so near as men report.  3 WATCHMAN. But say, I pray, what nobleman is that That with the King here resteth in his tent?  1 WATCHMAN. ’Tis the Lord Hastings, the King’s chiefest friend.  3 WATCHMAN. O, is it so? But why commands the King That his chief followers lodge in towns about him, While he himself keeps in the cold field?  2 WATCHMAN. ’Tis the more honour, because more dangerous.  3 WATCHMAN. Ay, but give me worship and quietness; I like it better than dangerous honour. If Warwick knew in what estate he stands, ’Tis to be doubted he would waken him.  1 WATCHMAN. Unless our halberds did shut up his passage.  2 WATCHMAN. Ay, wherefore else guard we his royal tent But to defend his person from night-foes?  Enter Warwick, George (Duke of Clarence), Oxford, Somerset and French Soldiers, silent all.  WARWICK. This is his tent; and see where stand his guard. Courage, my masters! Honour now or never! But follow me, and Edward shall be ours.  1 WATCHMAN. Who goes there?  2 WATCHMAN. Stay, or thou diest.  [_Warwick and the rest cry all, “Warwick! Warwick!” and set upon the guard, who fly, crying “Arm! Arm!” Warwick  and the rest following them._]  The drum playing and trumpet sounding, enter Warwick, Somerset, and the rest, bringing the King out in his gown, sitting in a chair. Richard (Duke of Gloucester) and Hastings fly over the stage.  SOMERSET. What are they that fly there?  WARWICK. Richard and Hastings. Let them go. Here is the Duke.  KING EDWARD. The Duke? Why, Warwick, when we parted, Thou call’dst me king?  WARWICK. Ay, but the case is altered. When you disgraced me in my embassade, Then I degraded you from being king, And come now to create you Duke of York. Alas, how should you govern any kingdom That know not how to use ambassadors, Nor how to be contented with one wife, Nor how to use your brothers brotherly, Nor how to study for the people’s welfare, Nor how to shroud yourself from enemies?  KING EDWARD. Yea, brother of Clarence, art thou here too? Nay, then I see that Edward needs must down. Yet, Warwick, in despite of all mischance Of thee thyself and all thy complices, Edward will always bear himself as king. Though Fortune’s malice overthrow my state, My mind exceeds the compass of her wheel.  WARWICK. Then for his mind be Edward England’s king;  [_Takes off his crown._]  But Henry now shall wear the English crown And be true king indeed, thou but the shadow. My lord of Somerset, at my request, See that forthwith Duke Edward be conveyed Unto my brother, Archbishop of York. When I have fought with Pembroke and his fellows, I’ll follow you and tell what answer Lewis and the Lady Bona send to him. Now, for a while farewell, good Duke of York.  [_They begin to lead him out forcibly._]  KING EDWARD. What fates impose, that men must needs abide; It boots not to resist both wind and tide.  [_Exit King Edward, led out; Somerset with him._]  OXFORD. What now remains, my lords, for us to do, But march to London with our soldiers?  WARWICK. Ay, that’s the first thing that we have to do, To free King Henry from imprisonment And see him seated in the regal throne.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IV. London. The Palace  Enter Queen Elizabeth and Rivers.  RIVERS. Madam, what makes you in this sudden change?  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Why, brother Rivers, are you yet to learn What late misfortune is befall’n King Edward?  RIVERS. What, loss of some pitched battle against Warwick?  QUEEN ELIZABETH. No, but the loss of his own royal person.  RIVERS. Then is my sovereign slain?  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Ay, almost slain, for he is taken prisoner, Either betrayed by falsehood of his guard Or by his foe surprised at unawares; And, as I further have to understand, Is new committed to the Bishop of York, Fell Warwick’s brother and by that our foe.  RIVERS. These news, I must confess, are full of grief; Yet, gracious madam, bear it as you may. Warwick may lose that now hath won the day.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Till then, fair hope must hinder life’s decay; And I the rather wean me from despair For love of Edward’s offspring in my womb. This is it that makes me bridle passion And bear with mildness my misfortune’s cross, Ay, ay, for this I draw in many a tear And stop the rising of blood-sucking sighs, Lest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown King Edward’s fruit, true heir to th’ English crown.  RIVERS. But, madam, where is Warwick then become?  QUEEN ELIZABETH. I am informed that he comes towards London To set the crown once more on Henry’s head. Guess thou the rest: King Edward’s friends must down. But to prevent the tyrant’s violence— For trust not him that hath once broken faith— I’ll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary To save at least the heir of Edward’s right. There shall I rest secure from force and fraud. Come, therefore, let us fly while we may fly. If Warwick take us, we are sure to die.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE V. A park near Middleham Castle in Yorkshire  Enter Richard (Duke of Gloucester), Lord Hastings, Sir William Stanley and others.  RICHARD. Now, my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley, Leave off to wonder why I drew you hither Into this chiefest thicket of the park. Thus stands the case: you know our King, my brother, Is prisoner to the Bishop here, at whose hands He hath good usage and great liberty, And often but attended with weak guard, Comes hunting this way to disport himself. I have advertised him by secret means That if about this hour he make this way, Under the colour of his usual game, He shall here find his friends with horse and men To set him free from his captivity.  Enter King Edward and a Huntsman with him.  HUNTSMAN. This way, my lord, for this way lies the game.  KING EDWARD. Nay, this way, man. See where the huntsmen stand. Now, brother of Gloucester, Lord Hastings, and the rest, Stand you thus close to steal the Bishop’s deer?  RICHARD. Brother, the time and case requireth haste; Your horse stands ready at the park corner.  KING EDWARD. But whither shall we then?  HASTINGS. To Lynn, my lord, and shipped from thence to Flanders.  RICHARD. Well guessed, believe me, for that was my meaning.  KING EDWARD. Stanley, I will requite thy forwardness.  RICHARD. But wherefore stay we? ’Tis no time to talk.  KING EDWARD. Huntsman, what sayst thou? Wilt thou go along?  HUNTSMAN. Better do so than tarry and be hanged.  RICHARD. Come then, away! Let’s ha’ no more ado.  KING EDWARD. Bishop, farewell; shield thee from Warwick’s frown, And pray that I may repossess the crown.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE VI. London. The Tower  Enter King Henry, George (Duke of Clarence), Warwick, Somerset, young Richmond, Oxford, Montague, and Lieutenant of the Tower.  KING HENRY. Master Lieutenant, now that God and friends Have shaken Edward from the regal seat And turned my captive state to liberty, My fear to hope, my sorrows unto joys, At our enlargement what are thy due fees?  LIEUTENANT. Subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns; But if an humble prayer may prevail, I then crave pardon of your Majesty.  KING HENRY. For what, lieutenant? For well using me? Nay, be thou sure I’ll well requite thy kindness, For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure; Ay, such a pleasure as incaged birds Conceive when, after many moody thoughts, At last by notes of household harmony They quite forget their loss of liberty. But, Warwick, after God thou sett’st me free, And chiefly therefore I thank God and thee; He was the author, thou the instrument. Therefore, that I may conquer Fortune’s spite, By living low where Fortune cannot hurt me, And that the people of this blessed land May not be punished with my thwarting stars, Warwick, although my head still wear the crown, I here resign my government to thee, For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds.  WARWICK. Your Grace hath still been famed for virtuous, And now may seem as wise as virtuous By spying and avoiding Fortune’s malice, For few men rightly temper with the stars; Yet in this one thing let me blame your Grace, For choosing me when Clarence is in place.  GEORGE. No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway, To whom the heavens in thy nativity Adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown, As likely to be blest in peace and war; And therefore I yield thee my free consent.  WARWICK. And I choose Clarence only for Protector.  KING HENRY. Warwick and Clarence, give me both your hands. Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts, That no dissension hinder government. I make you both Protectors of this land, While I myself will lead a private life And in devotion spend my latter days, To sin’s rebuke and my Creator’s praise.  WARWICK. What answers Clarence to his sovereign’s will?  GEORGE. That he consents, if Warwick yield consent, For on thy fortune I repose myself.  WARWICK. Why, then, though loath, yet I must be content. We’ll yoke together, like a double shadow To Henry’s body, and supply his place; I mean, in bearing weight of government, While he enjoys the honour and his ease. And, Clarence, now then it is more than needful Forthwith that Edward be pronounced a traitor And all his lands and goods be confiscate.  GEORGE. What else? And that succession be determined.  WARWICK. Ay, therein Clarence shall not want his part.  KING HENRY. But with the first of all your chief affairs Let me entreat—for I command no more— That Margaret your Queen and my son Edward Be sent for to return from France with speed; For till I see them here, by doubtful fear My joy of liberty is half eclipsed.  GEORGE. It shall be done, my sovereign, with all speed.  KING HENRY. My Lord of Somerset, what youth is that Of whom you seem to have so tender care?  SOMERSET. My liege, it is young Henry, Earl of Richmond.  KING HENRY. Come hither, England’s hope. If secret powers  [_Lays his hand on his head._]  Suggest but truth to my divining thoughts, This pretty lad will prove our country’s bliss. His looks are full of peaceful majesty, His head by nature framed to wear a crown, His hand to wield a sceptre, and himself Likely in time to bless a regal throne. Make much of him, my lords, for this is he Must help you more than you are hurt by me.  Enter a Post.  WARWICK. What news, my friend?  POST. That Edward is escaped from your brother And fled, as he hears since, to Burgundy.  WARWICK. Unsavoury news! But how made he escape?  POST. He was conveyed by Richard, Duke of Gloucester And the Lord Hastings, who attended him In secret ambush on the forest side And from the Bishop’s huntsmen rescued him, For hunting was his daily exercise.  WARWICK. My brother was too careless of his charge. But let us hence, my sovereign, to provide A salve for any sore that may betide.  [_Exeunt all but Somerset, Richmond and Oxford._]  SOMERSET. My lord, I like not of this flight of Edward’s, For doubtless Burgundy will yield him help, And we shall have more wars before ’t be long. As Henry’s late presaging prophecy Did glad my heart with hope of this young Richmond, So doth my heart misgive me, in these conflicts What may befall him, to his harm and ours. Therefore, Lord Oxford, to prevent the worst, Forthwith we’ll send him hence to Brittany Till storms be past of civil enmity.  OXFORD. Ay, for if Edward repossess the crown, ’Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall down.  SOMERSET. It shall be so. He shall to Brittany. Come therefore, let’s about it speedily.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE VII. Before York  Flourish. Enter King Edward, Richard (Duke of Gloucester), Hastings and Soldiers.  KING EDWARD. Now, brother Richard, Lord Hastings, and the rest, Yet thus far Fortune maketh us amends, And says that once more I shall interchange My waned state for Henry’s regal crown. Well have we passed and now repassed the seas, And brought desired help from Burgundy. What then remains, we being thus arrived From Ravenspurgh haven before the gates of York, But that we enter as into our dukedom?  RICHARD. The gates made fast! Brother, I like not this; For many men that stumble at the threshold Are well foretold that danger lurks within.  KING EDWARD. Tush, man, abodements must not now affright us. By fair or foul means we must enter in, For hither will our friends repair to us.  HASTINGS. My liege, I’ll knock once more to summon them.  Enter on the walls, the Mayor of York and his Brethren.  MAYOR. My lords, we were forewarned of your coming And shut the gates for safety of ourselves, For now we owe allegiance unto Henry.  KING EDWARD. But, master Mayor, if Henry be your king, Yet Edward, at the least, is Duke of York.  MAYOR. True, my good lord, I know you for no less.  KING EDWARD. Why, and I challenge nothing but my dukedom, As being well content with that alone.  RICHARD. [_Aside_.] But when the fox hath once got in his nose, He’ll soon find means to make the body follow.  HASTINGS. Why, master Mayor, why stand you in a doubt? Open the gates; we are King Henry’s friends.  MAYOR. Ay, say you so? The gates shall then be opened.  [_He descends._]  RICHARD. A wise, stout captain, and soon persuaded.  HASTINGS. The good old man would fain that all were well, So ’twere not long of him; but, being entered, I doubt not, I, but we shall soon persuade Both him and all his brothers unto reason.  Enter the Mayor and two Aldermen below.  KING EDWARD. So, master Mayor, these gates must not be shut But in the night or in the time of war. What, fear not, man, but yield me up the keys;  [_Takes his keys._]  For Edward will defend the town and thee And all those friends that deign to follow me.  March. Enter Montgomery with drum and Soldiers.  RICHARD. Brother, this is Sir John Montgomery, Our trusty friend unless I be deceived.  KING EDWARD. Welcome, Sir John! But why come you in arms?  MONTGOMERY. To help King Edward in his time of storm, As every loyal subject ought to do.  KING EDWARD. Thanks, good Montgomery; but we now forget Our title to the crown, and only claim Our dukedom till God please to send the rest.  MONTGOMERY. Then fare you well, for I will hence again. I came to serve a king, and not a duke. Drummer, strike up, and let us march away.  [_The drum begins to march._]  KING EDWARD. Nay, stay, Sir John, a while, and we’ll debate By what safe means the crown may be recovered.  MONTGOMERY. What talk you of debating? In few words, If you’ll not here proclaim yourself our king, I’ll leave you to your fortune and be gone To keep them back that come to succour you. Why shall we fight if you pretend no title?  RICHARD. Why, brother, wherefore stand you on nice points?  KING EDWARD. When we grow stronger, then we’ll make our claim. Till then ’tis wisdom to conceal our meaning.  HASTINGS. Away with scrupulous wit! Now arms must rule.  RICHARD. And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns. Brother, we will proclaim you out of hand; The bruit thereof will bring you many friends.  KING EDWARD. Then be it as you will; for ’tis my right, And Henry but usurps the diadem.  MONTGOMERY. Ay, now my sovereign speaketh like himself, And now will I be Edward’s champion.  HASTINGS. Sound, trumpet; Edward shall be here proclaimed. Come, fellow soldier, make thou proclamation.  [_Gives him a paper. Flourish._]  SOLDIER. [_Reads_.] _Edward the Fourth, by the Grace of God, King of England and France, and Lord of Ireland, etc._  MONTGOMERY. And whoso’er gainsays King Edward’s right, By this I challenge him to single fight.  [_Throws down his gauntlet._]  ALL. Long live Edward the Fourth!  KING EDWARD. Thanks, brave Montgomery, and thanks unto you all. If Fortune serve me, I’ll requite this kindness. Now for this night let’s harbour here in York, And when the morning sun shall raise his car Above the border of this horizon We’ll forward towards Warwick and his mates; For well I wot that Henry is no soldier. Ah, froward Clarence, how evil it beseems thee To flatter Henry and forsake thy brother! Yet, as we may, we’ll meet both thee and Warwick. Come on, brave soldiers; doubt not of the day, And, that once gotten, doubt not of large pay.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE VIII. London. The Palace  Flourish. Enter King Henry, Warwick, Montague, George (Duke of Clarence), Oxford and Exeter.  WARWICK. What counsel, lords? Edward from Belgia, With hasty Germans and blunt Hollanders, Hath passed in safety through the Narrow Seas, And with his troops doth march amain to London; And many giddy people flock to him.  KING HENRY. Let’s levy men and beat him back again.  GEORGE. A little fire is quickly trodden out, Which, being suffered, rivers cannot quench.  WARWICK. In Warwickshire I have true-hearted friends, Not mutinous in peace, yet bold in war. Those will I muster up; and thou, son Clarence, Shalt stir up in Suffolk, Norfolk, and in Kent The knights and gentlemen to come with thee. Thou, brother Montague, in Buckingham, Northampton, and in Leicestershire shalt find Men well inclined to hear what thou command’st. And thou, brave Oxford, wondrous well beloved, In Oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends. My sovereign, with the loving citizens, Like to his island girt in with the ocean, Or modest Dian circled with her nymphs, Shall rest in London till we come to him. Fair lords, take leave and stand not to reply. Farewell, my sovereign.  KING HENRY. Farewell, my Hector, and my Troy’s true hope.  GEORGE. In sign of truth, I kiss your Highness’ hand.  KING HENRY. Well-minded Clarence, be thou fortunate.  MONTAGUE. Comfort, my lord; and so I take my leave.  OXFORD. And thus [_kissing Henry’s hand_] I seal my truth, and bid adieu.  KING HENRY. Sweet Oxford, and my loving Montague, And all at once, once more a happy farewell.  WARWICK. Farewell, sweet lords; let’s meet at Coventry.  [_Exeunt all but King Henry and Exeter._]  KING HENRY. Here at the palace will I rest a while. Cousin of Exeter, what thinks your lordship? Methinks the power that Edward hath in field Should not be able to encounter mine.  EXETER. The doubt is that he will seduce the rest.  KING HENRY. That’s not my fear; my meed hath got me fame. I have not stopped mine ears to their demands, Nor posted off their suits with slow delays; My pity hath been balm to heal their wounds, My mildness hath allayed their swelling griefs, My mercy dried their water-flowing tears. I have not been desirous of their wealth Nor much oppressed them with great subsidies, Nor forward of revenge, though they much erred. Then why should they love Edward more than me? No, Exeter, these graces challenge grace; And when the lion fawns upon the lamb, The lamb will never cease to follow him.  [_Shout within “A York! A York!”_]  EXETER. Hark, hark, my lord, what shouts are these?  Enter King Edward, Richard (Duke of Gloucester) and Soldiers.  KING EDWARD. Seize on the shame-faced Henry, bear him hence, And once again proclaim us King of England. You are the fount that makes small brooks to flow. Now stops thy spring; my sea shall suck them dry And swell so much the higher by their ebb. Hence with him to the Tower. Let him not speak.  [_Exeunt some with King Henry._]  And, lords, towards Coventry bend we our course, Where peremptory Warwick now remains. The sun shines hot, and, if we use delay, Cold biting winter mars our hoped-for hay.  RICHARD. Away betimes, before his forces join, And take the great-grown traitor unawares. Brave warriors, march amain towards Coventry.  [_Exeunt._]

  Enter Prologue.
THE PROLOGUE. I come no more to make you laugh. Things now That bear a weighty and a serious brow, Sad, high, and working, full of state and woe, Such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow, We now present. Those that can pity, here May, if they think it well, let fall a tear; The subject will deserve it. Such as give Their money out of hope they may believe May here find truth too. Those that come to see Only a show or two, and so agree The play may pass, if they be still and willing, I’ll undertake may see away their shilling Richly in two short hours. Only they That come to hear a merry bawdy play, A noise of targets, or to see a fellow In a long motley coat guarded with yellow, Will be deceived. For, gentle hearers, know To rank our chosen truth with such a show As fool and fight is, beside forfeiting Our own brains and the opinion that we bring To make that only true we now intend, Will leave us never an understanding friend. Therefore, for goodness’ sake, and as you are known The first and happiest hearers of the town, Be sad, as we would make ye. Think ye see The very persons of our noble story As they were living; think you see them great, And followed with the general throng and sweat Of thousand friends; then, in a moment, see How soon this mightiness meets misery; And if you can be merry then, I’ll say A man may weep upon his wedding day.  [_Exit._]
  ACT I  SCENE I. London. An ante-chamber in the palace.
Enter the Duke of Norfolk at one door; at the other, the Duke of Buckingham and the Lord Abergavenny.  BUCKINGHAM. Good morrow, and well met. How have ye done Since last we saw in France?
  ACT II  SCENE I. Westminster. A street.
  ACT III  SCENE I. London. The Queen’s apartments.
Enter Queen and her Women, as at work.  QUEEN KATHERINE. Take thy lute, wench. My soul grows sad with troubles. Sing, and disperse ’em, if thou canst. Leave working.  WOMAN [_sings song._]  Orpheus with his lute made trees And the mountain tops that freeze     Bow themselves when he did sing. To his music plants and flowers Ever sprung, as sun and showers     There had made a lasting spring.
  ACT IV  SCENE I. A street in Westminster.
Enter two Gentlemen, meeting one another.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. You’re well met once again.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. So are you.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. You come to take your stand here and behold The Lady Anne pass from her coronation?  SECOND GENTLEMAN. ’Tis all my business. At our last encounter, The Duke of Buckingham came from his trial.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. ’Tis very true. But that time offered sorrow, This, general joy.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. ’Tis well. The citizens, I am sure, have shown at full their royal minds, As, let ’em have their rights, they are ever forward In celebration of this day with shows, Pageants, and sights of honour.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Never greater, Nor, I’ll assure you, better taken, sir.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. May I be bold to ask what that contains, That paper in your hand?  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Yes, ’tis the list Of those that claim their offices this day By custom of the coronation. The Duke of Suffolk is the first, and claims To be High Steward; next, the Duke of Norfolk, He to be Earl Marshal. You may read the rest.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. I thank you, sir. Had I not known those customs, I should have been beholding to your paper. But I beseech you, what’s become of Katherine, The Princess Dowager? How goes her business?  FIRST GENTLEMAN. That I can tell you too. The Archbishop Of Canterbury, accompanied with other Learned and reverend fathers of his order, Held a late court at Dunstable, six miles off From Ampthill where the Princess lay; to which She was often cited by them, but appeared not; And, to be short, for not appearance and The King’s late scruple, by the main assent Of all these learned men she was divorced, And the late marriage made of none effect; Since which she was removed to Kimbolton, Where she remains now sick.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Alas, good lady!  [_Trumpets._]  The trumpets sound. Stand close. The Queen is coming.  _The order of the coronation_.
_1. A lively flourish of trumpets. 2. Then, two Judges. 3. Lord Chancellor, with purse and mace before him. 4. Choristers, singing. Music. 5. Mayor of London, bearing the mace. Then Garter, in his coat of arms, and on his head he wore a gilt copper crown. 6. Marquess Dorset, bearing a sceptre of gold, on his head a demi-coronal of gold. With him, the Earl of Surrey, bearing the rod of silver with the dove, crowned with an earl’s coronet. Collars of S’s. 7. Duke of Suffolk, in his robe of estate, his coronet on his head, bearing a long white wand, as High Steward. With him, the Duke of Norfolk, with the rod of marshalship, a coronet on his head. Collars of S’s. 8. A canopy, borne by four of the Cinque Ports; under it, the Queen in her robe, in her hair, richly adorned with pearl, crowned. On each side her, the Bishops of London and Winchester. 9. The old Duchess of Norfolk, in a coronal of gold wrought with flowers, bearing the Queen’s train. 10. Certain Ladies or Countesses, with plain circlets of gold without flowers._  [_Exeunt, first passing over the stage in order and state, and then a great flourish of trumpets._]  SECOND GENTLEMAN. A royal train, believe me. These I know. Who’s that that bears the sceptre?  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Marquess Dorset, And that the Earl of Surrey with the rod.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. A bold brave gentleman. That should be The Duke of Suffolk.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. ’Tis the same: High Steward.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. And that my Lord of Norfolk?  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Yes.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. [_Sees the Queen_.] Heaven bless thee! Thou hast the sweetest face I ever looked on. Sir, as I have a soul, she is an angel. Our King has all the Indies in his arms, And more, and richer, when he strains that lady. I cannot blame his conscience.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. They that bear The cloth of honour over her are four barons Of the Cinque Ports.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Those men are happy, and so are all are near her. I take it she that carries up the train Is that old noble lady, Duchess of Norfolk.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. It is, and all the rest are countesses.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Their coronets say so. These are stars indeed.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. And sometimes falling ones.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. No more of that.  [_Exit the last of the procession._]  Enter a third Gentleman.  God save you, sir. Where have you been broiling?  THIRD GENTLEMAN. Among the crowds i’ th’ Abbey, where a finger Could not be wedged in more. I am stifled With the mere rankness of their joy.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. You saw The ceremony?  THIRD GENTLEMAN. That I did.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. How was it?  THIRD GENTLEMAN. Well worth the seeing.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Good sir, speak it to us.  THIRD GENTLEMAN. As well as I am able. The rich stream Of lords and ladies, having brought the Queen To a prepared place in the choir, fell off A distance from her, while her Grace sat down To rest a while, some half an hour or so, In a rich chair of state, opposing freely The beauty of her person to the people. Believe me, sir, she is the goodliest woman That ever lay by man, which when the people Had the full view of, such a noise arose As the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest, As loud and to as many tunes. Hats, cloaks, Doublets, I think, flew up, and had their faces Been loose, this day they had been lost. Such joy I never saw before. Great-bellied women That had not half a week to go, like rams In the old time of war, would shake the press And make ’em reel before ’em. No man living Could say “This is my wife” there, all were woven So strangely in one piece.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. But what followed?  THIRD GENTLEMAN. At length her Grace rose, and with modest paces Came to the altar, where she kneeled and saintlike Cast her fair eyes to heaven and prayed devoutly; Then rose again and bowed her to the people, When by the Archbishop of Canterbury She had all the royal makings of a queen, As holy oil, Edward Confessor’s crown, The rod, and bird of peace, and all such emblems Laid nobly on her; which performed, the choir, With all the choicest music of the kingdom, Together sung _Te Deum_. So she parted, And with the same full state paced back again To York Place, where the feast is held.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Sir, You must no more call it “York Place”, that’s past; For since the Cardinal fell, that title’s lost. ’Tis now the King’s, and called “Whitehall”.  THIRD GENTLEMAN. I know it, But ’tis so lately altered that the old name Is fresh about me.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. What two reverend bishops Were those that went on each side of the Queen?  THIRD GENTLEMAN. Stokesley and Gardiner, the one of Winchester, Newly preferred from the King’s secretary; The other, London.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. He of Winchester Is held no great good lover of the Archbishop’s, The virtuous Cranmer.  THIRD GENTLEMAN. All the land knows that. However, yet there is no great breach. When it comes, Cranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Who may that be, I pray you?  THIRD GENTLEMAN. Thomas Cromwell, A man in much esteem with th’ King, and truly A worthy friend. The King has made him Master o’ th’ Jewel House, And one already of the Privy Council.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. He will deserve more.  THIRD GENTLEMAN. Yes, without all doubt. Come, gentlemen, ye shall go my way, Which is to th’ court, and there ye shall be my guests, Something I can command. As I walk thither, I’ll tell ye more.  BOTH. You may command us, sir.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. Kimbolton.  Enter Katherine Dowager, sick, led between Griffith, her gentleman usher, and Patience, her woman.  GRIFFITH. How does your Grace?  QUEEN KATHERINE. O Griffith, sick to death. My legs like loaden branches bow to th’ earth, Willing to leave their burden. Reach a chair.  [_She sits._]  So. Now, methinks, I feel a little ease. Didst thou not tell me, Griffith, as thou ledst me, That the great child of honour, Cardinal Wolsey, Was dead?  GRIFFITH. Yes, madam, but I think your Grace, Out of the pain you suffered, gave no ear to’t.  QUEEN KATHERINE. Prithee, good Griffith, tell me how he died. If well, he stepped before me happily For my example.  GRIFFITH. Well, the voice goes, madam. For after the stout Earl Northumberland Arrested him at York and brought him forward, As a man sorely tainted, to his answer, He fell sick suddenly and grew so ill He could not sit his mule.  QUEEN KATHERINE. Alas, poor man!  GRIFFITH. At last, with easy roads, he came to Leicester, Lodged in the abbey, where the reverend abbot, With all his covent, honourably received him; To whom he gave these words: “O father abbot, An old man, broken with the storms of state, Is come to lay his weary bones among ye. Give him a little earth for charity.” So went to bed, where eagerly his sickness Pursued him still; and three nights after this, About the hour of eight, which he himself Foretold should be his last, full of repentance, Continual meditations, tears, and sorrows, He gave his honours to the world again, His blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace.  QUEEN KATHERINE. So may he rest. His faults lie gently on him! Yet thus far, Griffith, give me leave to speak him, And yet with charity. He was a man Of an unbounded stomach, ever ranking Himself with princes; one that by suggestion Tied all the kingdom. Simony was fair-play. His own opinion was his law. I’ th’ presence He would say untruths, and be ever double Both in his words and meaning. He was never, But where he meant to ruin, pitiful. His promises were, as he then was, mighty; But his performance, as he is now, nothing. Of his own body he was ill, and gave The clergy ill example.  GRIFFITH. Noble madam, Men’s evil manners live in brass; their virtues We write in water. May it please your Highness To hear me speak his good now?  QUEEN KATHERINE. Yes, good Griffith; I were malicious else.  GRIFFITH. This Cardinal, Though from an humble stock, undoubtedly Was fashioned to much honour. From his cradle He was a scholar, and a ripe and good one, Exceeding wise, fair-spoken, and persuading; Lofty and sour to them that loved him not, But to those men that sought him, sweet as summer. And though he were unsatisfied in getting, Which was a sin, yet in bestowing, madam, He was most princely. Ever witness for him Those twins of learning that he raised in you, Ipswich and Oxford, one of which fell with him, Unwilling to outlive the good that did it; The other, though unfinished, yet so famous, So excellent in art, and still so rising, That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue. His overthrow heaped happiness upon him, For then, and not till then, he felt himself, And found the blessedness of being little. And, to add greater honours to his age Than man could give him, he died fearing God.  QUEEN KATHERINE. After my death I wish no other herald, No other speaker of my living actions, To keep mine honour from corruption But such an honest chronicler as Griffith. Whom I most hated living, thou hast made me, With thy religious truth and modesty, Now in his ashes honour. Peace be with him! Patience, be near me still, and set me lower: I have not long to trouble thee. Good Griffith, Cause the musicians play me that sad note I named my knell, whilst I sit meditating On that celestial harmony I go to.  [_Sad and solemn music._]  GRIFFITH. She is asleep. Good wench, let’s sit down quiet, For fear we wake her. Softly, gentle Patience.  _The vision._
Enter, solemnly tripping one after another, six Personages, clad in white robes, wearing on their heads garlands of bays, and golden vizards on their faces, branches of bays or palm in their hands. They first congee unto her, then dance; and, at certain changes, the first two hold a spare garland over her head, at which the other four make reverent curtsies. Then the two that held the garland deliver the same to the other next two, who observe the same order in their changes and holding the garland over her head; which done, they deliver the same garland to the last two, who likewise observe the same order. At which, as it were by inspiration, she makes in her sleep signs of rejoicing and holdeth up her hands to heaven. And so in their dancing, vanish, carrying the garland with them. The music continues.  QUEEN KATHERINE. Spirits of peace, where are ye? Are ye all gone, And leave me here in wretchedness behind ye?  GRIFFITH. Madam, we are here.  QUEEN KATHERINE. It is not you I call for. Saw ye none enter since I slept?  GRIFFITH. None, madam.  QUEEN KATHERINE. No? Saw you not, even now, a blessed troop Invite me to a banquet, whose bright faces Cast thousand beams upon me, like the sun? They promised me eternal happiness And brought me garlands, Griffith, which I feel I am not worthy yet to wear. I shall, assuredly.  GRIFFITH. I am most joyful, madam, such good dreams Possess your fancy.  QUEEN KATHERINE. Bid the music leave, They are harsh and heavy to me.  [_Music ceases._]  PATIENCE. Do you note How much her Grace is altered on the sudden? How long her face is drawn? How pale she looks, And of an earthly cold? Mark her eyes.  GRIFFITH. She is going, wench. Pray, pray.  PATIENCE. Heaven comfort her!  Enter a Messenger.  MESSENGER. An’t like your Grace—  QUEEN KATHERINE. You are a saucy fellow. Deserve we no more reverence?  GRIFFITH. You are to blame, Knowing she will not lose her wonted greatness, To use so rude behaviour. Go to, kneel.  MESSENGER. I humbly do entreat your Highness’ pardon. My haste made me unmannerly. There is staying A gentleman sent from the King to see you.  QUEEN KATHERINE. Admit him entrance, Griffith. But this fellow Let me ne’er see again.  [_Exit Messenger._]  Enter Lord Caputius.  If my sight fail not, You should be lord ambassador from the Emperor, My royal nephew, and your name Caputius.  CAPUTIUS. Madam, the same. Your servant.  QUEEN KATHERINE. O my lord, The times and titles now are altered strangely With me since first you knew me. But I pray you, What is your pleasure with me?  CAPUTIUS. Noble lady, First, mine own service to your Grace; the next, The King’s request that I would visit you, Who grieves much for your weakness, and by me Sends you his princely commendations, And heartily entreats you take good comfort.  QUEEN KATHERINE. O my good lord, that comfort comes too late; ’Tis like a pardon after execution. That gentle physic given in time had cured me, But now I am past all comforts here but prayers. How does his Highness?  CAPUTIUS. Madam, in good health.  QUEEN KATHERINE. So may he ever do, and ever flourish, When I shall dwell with worms, and my poor name Banished the kingdom. Patience, is that letter I caused you write yet sent away?  PATIENCE. No, madam.  [_Giving it to Katherine._]  QUEEN KATHERINE. Sir, I most humbly pray you to deliver This to my lord the King.  CAPUTIUS. Most willing, madam.  QUEEN KATHERINE. In which I have commended to his goodness The model of our chaste loves, his young daughter— The dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her!— Beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding— She is young and of a noble modest nature; I hope she will deserve well—and a little To love her for her mother’s sake that loved him, Heaven knows how dearly. My next poor petition Is that his noble Grace would have some pity Upon my wretched women, that so long Have followed both my fortunes faithfully; Of which there is not one, I dare avow— And now I should not lie—but will deserve, For virtue and true beauty of the soul, For honesty and decent carriage, A right good husband. Let him be a noble; And sure those men are happy that shall have ’em. The last is for my men—they are the poorest, But poverty could never draw ’em from me— That they may have their wages duly paid ’em, And something over to remember me by. If heaven had pleased to have given me longer life And able means, we had not parted thus. These are the whole contents, and, good my lord, By that you love the dearest in this world, As you wish Christian peace to souls departed, Stand these poor people’s friend, and urge the King To do me this last right.  CAPUTIUS. By heaven, I will, Or let me lose the fashion of a man!  QUEEN KATHERINE. I thank you, honest lord. Remember me In all humility unto his Highness. Say his long trouble now is passing Out of this world. Tell him in death I blessed him, For so I will. Mine eyes grow dim. Farewell, My lord. Griffith, farewell. Nay, Patience, You must not leave me yet. I must to bed; Call in more women. When I am dead, good wench, Let me be used with honour. Strew me over With maiden flowers, that all the world may know I was a chaste wife to my grave. Embalm me, Then lay me forth. Although unqueened, yet like A queen and daughter to a king inter me. I can no more.  [_Exeunt leading Katherine._]
  ACT V  SCENE I. A gallery in the palace.
Enter Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester, a Page with a torch before him, met by Sir Thomas Lovell.  GARDINER. It’s one o’clock, boy, is’t not?  PAGE. It hath struck.  GARDINER. These should be hours for necessities, Not for delights; times to repair our nature With comforting repose, and not for us To waste these times. Good hour of night, Sir Thomas! Whither so late?  LOVELL. Came you from the King, my lord?  GARDINER. I did, Sir Thomas, and left him at primero With the Duke of Suffolk.  LOVELL. I must to him too, Before he go to bed. I’ll take my leave.  GARDINER. Not yet, Sir Thomas Lovell. What’s the matter? It seems you are in haste. An if there be No great offence belongs to’t, give your friend Some touch of your late business. Affairs that walk, As they say spirits do, at midnight have In them a wilder nature than the business That seeks despatch by day.  LOVELL. My lord, I love you, And durst commend a secret to your ear Much weightier than this work. The Queen’s in labour— They say in great extremity, and feared She’ll with the labour end.  GARDINER. The fruit she goes with I pray for heartily, that it may find Good time, and live; but for the stock, Sir Thomas, I wish it grubbed up now.  LOVELL. Methinks I could Cry the amen, and yet my conscience says She’s a good creature and, sweet lady, does Deserve our better wishes.  GARDINER. But, sir, sir, Hear me, Sir Thomas. You’re a gentleman Of mine own way. I know you wise, religious; And let me tell you, it will ne’er be well, ’Twill not, Sir Thomas Lovell, take’t of me, Till Cranmer, Cromwell, her two hands, and she Sleep in their graves.  LOVELL. Now, sir, you speak of two The most remarked i’ th’ kingdom. As for Cromwell, Beside that of the Jewel House, is made Master O’ th’ Rolls, and the King’s secretary; further, sir, Stands in the gap and trade of more preferments, With which the time will load him. Th’ Archbishop Is the King’s hand and tongue, and who dare speak One syllable against him?  GARDINER. Yes, yes, Sir Thomas, There are that dare, and I myself have ventured To speak my mind of him. And indeed this day, Sir—I may tell it you, I think—I have Incensed the lords o’ th’ Council, that he is— For so I know he is, they know he is— A most arch heretic, a pestilence That does infect the land; with which they, moved, Have broken with the King, who hath so far Given ear to our complaint, of his great grace And princely care foreseeing those fell mischiefs Our reasons laid before him, hath commanded Tomorrow morning to the Council board He be convented. He’s a rank weed, Sir Thomas, And we must root him out. From your affairs I hinder you too long. Good night, Sir Thomas.  LOVELL. Many good nights, my lord. I rest your servant.  [_Exeunt Gardiner and Page._]  Enter King and Suffolk.  KING. Charles, I will play no more tonight. My mind’s not on’t; you are too hard for me.  SUFFOLK. Sir, I did never win of you before.  KING. But little, Charles, Nor shall not, when my fancy’s on my play. Now, Lovell, from the Queen what is the news?  LOVELL. I could not personally deliver to her What you commanded me, but by her woman I sent your message, who returned her thanks In the great’st humbleness, and desired your Highness Most heartily to pray for her.  KING. What sayst thou, ha? To pray for her? What, is she crying out?  LOVELL. So said her woman, and that her suff’rance made Almost each pang a death.  KING. Alas, good lady!  SUFFOLK. God safely quit her of her burden, and With gentle travail, to the gladding of Your Highness with an heir!  KING. ’Tis midnight, Charles. Prithee, to bed, and in thy prayers remember Th’ estate of my poor Queen. Leave me alone, For I must think of that which company Will not be friendly to.  SUFFOLK. I wish your Highness A quiet night, and my good mistress will Remember in my prayers.  KING. Charles, good night.  [_Exit Suffolk._]  Enter Sir Anthony Denny.  Well, sir, what follows?  DENNY. Sir, I have brought my lord the Archbishop, As you commanded me.  KING. Ha! Canterbury?  DENNY. Ay, my good lord.  KING. ’Tis true. Where is he, Denny?  DENNY. He attends your Highness’ pleasure.  KING. Bring him to us.  [_Exit Denny._]  LOVELL. [_Aside_.] This is about that which the Bishop spake. I am happily come hither.  Enter Cranmer and Denny.  KING. Avoid the gallery. [_Lovell seems to stay_.] Ha! I have said. Be gone. What!  [_Exeunt Lovell and Denny._]  CRANMER. [_Aside_.] I am fearful. Wherefore frowns he thus? ’Tis his aspect of terror. All’s not well.  KING. How now, my lord? You do desire to know Wherefore I sent for you.  CRANMER. [_Kneeling_.] It is my duty T’ attend your Highness’ pleasure.  KING. Pray you, arise, My good and gracious Lord of Canterbury. Come, you and I must walk a turn together. I have news to tell you. Come, come, give me your hand. Ah, my good lord, I grieve at what I speak, And am right sorry to repeat what follows. I have, and most unwillingly, of late Heard many grievous—I do say, my lord, Grievous—complaints of you, which, being considered, Have moved us and our Council that you shall This morning come before us, where I know, You cannot with such freedom purge yourself But that, till further trial in those charges Which will require your answer, you must take Your patience to you and be well contented To make your house our Tower. You a brother of us, It fits we thus proceed, or else no witness Would come against you.  CRANMER. [_Kneeling_.] I humbly thank your Highness, And am right glad to catch this good occasion Most throughly to be winnowed, where my chaff And corn shall fly asunder. For I know There’s none stands under more calumnious tongues Than I myself, poor man.  KING. Stand up, good Canterbury! Thy truth and thy integrity is rooted In us, thy friend. Give me thy hand. Stand up. Prithee, let’s walk. Now, by my halidom, What manner of man are you? My lord, I looked You would have given me your petition that I should have ta’en some pains to bring together Yourself and your accusers and to have heard you Without endurance, further.  CRANMER. Most dread liege, The good I stand on is my truth and honesty. If they shall fail, I with mine enemies Will triumph o’er my person, which I weigh not, Being of those virtues vacant. I fear nothing What can be said against me.  KING. Know you not How your state stands i’ th’ world, with the whole world? Your enemies are many, and not small; their practices Must bear the same proportion, and not ever The justice and the truth o’ th’ question carries The due o’ th’ verdict with it. At what ease Might corrupt minds procure knaves as corrupt To swear against you? Such things have been done. You are potently opposed, and with a malice Of as great size. Ween you of better luck, I mean in perjured witness, than your master, Whose minister you are, whiles here he lived Upon this naughty earth? Go to, go to. You take a precipice for no leap of danger, And woo your own destruction.  CRANMER. God and your Majesty Protect mine innocence, or I fall into The trap is laid for me.  KING. Be of good cheer. They shall no more prevail than we give way to. Keep comfort to you, and this morning see You do appear before them. If they shall chance, In charging you with matters, to commit you, The best persuasions to the contrary Fail not to use, and with what vehemency Th’ occasion shall instruct you. If entreaties Will render you no remedy, this ring Deliver them, and your appeal to us There make before them. Look, the good man weeps! He’s honest, on mine honour. God’s blest mother, I swear he is true-hearted, and a soul None better in my kingdom.—Get you gone, And do as I have bid you.  [_Exit Cranmer._]  He has strangled His language in his tears.  LOVELL. [_Within_.] Come back! What mean you?  Enter Old Lady; Lovell follows.  OLD LADY. I’ll not come back. The tidings that I bring Will make my boldness manners. Now, good angels Fly o’er thy royal head and shade thy person Under their blessed wings!  KING. Now by thy looks I guess thy message. Is the Queen delivered? Say “Ay, and of a boy”.  OLD LADY. Ay, ay, my liege, And of a lovely boy. The God of heaven Both now and ever bless her! ’Tis a girl Promises boys hereafter. Sir, your Queen Desires your visitation, and to be Acquainted with this stranger. ’Tis as like you As cherry is to cherry.  KING. Lovell.  LOVELL. Sir?  KING. Give her an hundred marks. I’ll to the Queen.  [_Exit King._]  OLD LADY. An hundred marks? By this light, I’ll ha’ more. An ordinary groom is for such payment. I will have more or scold it out of him. Said I for this the girl was like to him? I’ll have more, or else unsay’t. And now, While ’tis hot, I’ll put it to the issue.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. Lobby before the council-chamber.  Enter Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury.  CRANMER. I hope I am not too late, and yet the gentleman That was sent to me from the Council prayed me To make great haste. All fast? What means this? Ho! Who waits there?  Enter Keeper.  Sure you know me?  KEEPER. Yes, my lord, But yet I cannot help you.  CRANMER. Why?  KEEPER. Your Grace must wait till you be called for.  Enter  Doctor Butts.  CRANMER. So.  BUTTS. [_Aside_.] This is a piece of malice. I am glad I came this way so happily. The King Shall understand it presently.  [_Exit._]  CRANMER. [_Aside_.] ’Tis Butts, The King’s physician. As he passed along, How earnestly he cast his eyes upon me! Pray heaven he sound not my disgrace. For certain, This is of purpose laid by some that hate me— God turn their hearts! I never sought their malice— To quench mine honour. They would shame to make me Wait else at door, a fellow councillor, ’Mong boys, grooms, and lackeys. But their pleasures Must be fulfilled, and I attend with patience.  Enter the King and Butts at a window above.  BUTTS. I’ll show your Grace the strangest sight.  KING. What’s that, Butts?  BUTTS. I think your Highness saw this many a day.  KING. Body o’ me, where is it?  BUTTS. There, my lord: The high promotion of his Grace of Canterbury, Who holds his state at door, ’mongst pursuivants, Pages, and footboys.  KING. Ha! ’Tis he, indeed. Is this the honour they do one another? ’Tis well there’s one above ’em yet. I had thought They had parted so much honesty among ’em— At least good manners—as not thus to suffer A man of his place, and so near our favour, To dance attendance on their lordships’ pleasures, And at the door too, like a post with packets. By holy Mary, Butts, there’s knavery! Let ’em alone, and draw the curtain close. We shall hear more anon.  [_Exeunt._]  A council table brought in with chairs and stools and placed under the state. Enter Lord Chancellor, places himself at the upper end of the table on the left hand, a seat being left void above him, as for Canterbury’s seat. Duke of Suffolk, Duke of Norfolk, Surrey, Lord Chamberlain, Gardiner seat themselves in order on each side; Cromwell at lower end, as secretary.  CHANCELLOR. Speak to the business, master secretary. Why are we met in council?  CROMWELL. Please your honours, The chief cause concerns his Grace of Canterbury.  GARDINER. Has he had knowledge of it?  CROMWELL. Yes.  NORFOLK. Who waits there?  KEEPER. Without, my noble lords?  GARDINER. Yes.  KEEPER. My lord Archbishop, And has done half an hour, to know your pleasures.  CHANCELLOR. Let him come in.  KEEPER. Your Grace may enter now.  Cranmer approaches the council table.  CHANCELLOR. My good lord Archbishop, I’m very sorry To sit here at this present and behold That chair stand empty. But we all are men, In our own natures frail, and capable Of our flesh—few are angels—out of which frailty And want of wisdom, you that best should teach us, Have misdemeaned yourself, and not a little, Toward the King first, then his laws, in filling The whole realm, by your teaching and your chaplains’— For so we are informed—with new opinions, Divers and dangerous, which are heresies And, not reformed, may prove pernicious.  GARDINER. Which reformation must be sudden too, My noble lords; for those that tame wild horses Pace ’em not in their hands to make ’em gentle, But stop their mouth with stubborn bits and spur ’em Till they obey the manage. If we suffer, Out of our easiness and childish pity To one man’s honour, this contagious sickness, Farewell, all physic. And what follows then? Commotions, uproars, with a general taint Of the whole state, as of late days our neighbours, The upper Germany, can dearly witness, Yet freshly pitied in our memories.  CRANMER. My good lords, hitherto in all the progress Both of my life and office, I have laboured, And with no little study, that my teaching And the strong course of my authority Might go one way, and safely; and the end Was ever to do well. Nor is there living— I speak it with a single heart, my lords— A man that more detests, more stirs against, Both in his private conscience and his place, Defacers of a public peace than I do. Pray heaven the King may never find a heart With less allegiance in it! Men that make Envy and crooked malice nourishment Dare bite the best. I do beseech your lordships That, in this case of justice, my accusers, Be what they will, may stand forth face to face And freely urge against me.  SUFFOLK. Nay, my lord, That cannot be. You are a councillor, And by that virtue no man dare accuse you.  GARDINER. My lord, because we have business of more moment, We will be short with you. ’Tis his Highness’ pleasure And our consent, for better trial of you, From hence you be committed to the Tower, Where, being but a private man again, You shall know many dare accuse you boldly— More than, I fear, you are provided for.  CRANMER. Ah, my good Lord of Winchester, I thank you. You are always my good friend. If your will pass, I shall both find your lordship judge and juror, You are so merciful. I see your end: ’Tis my undoing. Love and meekness, lord, Become a churchman better than ambition. Win straying souls with modesty again; Cast none away. That I shall clear myself, Lay all the weight ye can upon my patience, I make as little doubt as you do conscience In doing daily wrongs. I could say more, But reverence to your calling makes me modest.  GARDINER. My lord, my lord, you are a sectary, That’s the plain truth. Your painted gloss discovers, To men that understand you, words and weakness.  CROMWELL. My Lord of Winchester, you are a little, By your good favour, too sharp. Men so noble, However faulty, yet should find respect For what they have been. ’Tis a cruelty To load a falling man.  GARDINER. Good master secretary, I cry your honour mercy: you may worst Of all this table say so.  CROMWELL. Why, my lord?  GARDINER. Do not I know you for a favourer Of this new sect? Ye are not sound.  CROMWELL. Not sound?  GARDINER. Not sound, I say.  CROMWELL. Would you were half so honest! Men’s prayers then would seek you, not their fears.  GARDINER. I shall remember this bold language.  CROMWELL. Do. Remember your bold life too.  CHANCELLOR. This is too much. Forbear, for shame, my lords.  GARDINER. I have done.  CROMWELL. And I.  CHANCELLOR. Then thus for you, my lord: it stands agreed, I take it, by all voices, that forthwith You be conveyed to th’ Tower a prisoner, There to remain till the King’s further pleasure Be known unto us. Are you all agreed, lords?  ALL. We are.  CRANMER. Is there no other way of mercy But I must needs to th’ Tower, my lords?  GARDINER. What other Would you expect? You are strangely troublesome. Let some o’ th’ guard be ready there.  Enter the guard.  CRANMER. For me? Must I go like a traitor thither?  GARDINER. Receive him, And see him safe i’ th’ Tower.  CRANMER. Stay, good my lords, I have a little yet to say. Look there, my lords. By virtue of that ring, I take my cause Out of the gripes of cruel men and give it To a most noble judge, the King my master.  CHAMBERLAIN. This is the King’s ring.  SURREY. ’Tis no counterfeit.  SUFFOLK. ’Tis the right ring, by heaven! I told ye all, When we first put this dangerous stone a-rolling, ’Twould fall upon ourselves.  NORFOLK. Do you think, my lords, The King will suffer but the little finger Of this man to be vexed?  CHAMBERLAIN. ’Tis now too certain. How much more is his life in value with him? Would I were fairly out on’t!  CROMWELL. My mind gave me, In seeking tales and informations Against this man, whose honesty the devil And his disciples only envy at, Ye blew the fire that burns ye. Now have at ye!  Enter King, frowning on them; takes his seat.  GARDINER. Dread sovereign, how much are we bound to heaven In daily thanks, that gave us such a prince, Not only good and wise, but most religious; One that, in all obedience, makes the Church The chief aim of his honour and, to strengthen That holy duty out of dear respect, His royal self in judgement comes to hear The cause betwixt her and this great offender.  KING. You were ever good at sudden commendations, Bishop of Winchester. But know I come not To hear such flattery now, and in my presence They are too thin and bare to hide offences. To me you cannot reach, you play the spaniel, And think with wagging of your tongue to win me; But whatsoe’er thou tak’st me for, I’m sure Thou hast a cruel nature and a bloody. [_To Cranmer_.] Good man, sit down. Now let me see the proudest He, that dares most, but wag his finger at thee. By all that’s holy, he had better starve Than but once think this place becomes thee not.  SURREY. May it please your Grace—  KING. No, sir, it does not please me. I had thought I had had men of some understanding And wisdom of my Council, but I find none. Was it discretion, lords, to let this man, This good man—few of you deserve that title— This honest man, wait like a lousy footboy At chamber door? And one as great as you are? Why, what a shame was this! Did my commission Bid ye so far forget yourselves? I gave ye Power as he was a councillor to try him, Not as a groom. There’s some of ye, I see, More out of malice than integrity, Would try him to the utmost, had ye mean, Which ye shall never have while I live.  CHANCELLOR. Thus far, My most dread sovereign, may it like your Grace To let my tongue excuse all. What was purposed Concerning his imprisonment was rather, If there be faith in men, meant for his trial And fair purgation to the world than malice, I’m sure, in me.  KING. Well, well, my lords, respect him. Take him, and use him well; he’s worthy of it. I will say thus much for him: if a prince May be beholding to a subject, I Am, for his love and service, so to him. Make me no more ado, but all embrace him. Be friends, for shame, my lords! My Lord of Canterbury, I have a suit which you must not deny me: That is, a fair young maid that yet wants baptism. You must be godfather and answer for her.  CRANMER. The greatest monarch now alive may glory In such an honour. How may I deserve it, That am a poor and humble subject to you?  KING. Come, come, my lord, you’d spare your spoons. You shall have two noble partners with you: the old Duchess of Norfolk and Lady Marquess Dorset. Will these please you? Once more, my Lord of Winchester, I charge you, Embrace and love this man.  GARDINER. With a true heart And brother-love I do it.  CRANMER. And let heaven Witness how dear I hold this confirmation.  KING. Good man, those joyful tears show thy true heart. The common voice, I see, is verified Of thee, which says thus: “Do my Lord of Canterbury A shrewd turn, and he is your friend for ever.” Come, lords, we trifle time away. I long To have this young one made a Christian. As I have made ye one, lords, one remain. So I grow stronger, you more honour gain.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. The palace yard.  Noise and tumult within. Enter Porter and his Man.  PORTER. You’ll leave your noise anon, ye rascals. Do you take the court for Parish Garden? Ye rude slaves, leave your gaping.  ONE. [_Within_.] Good master porter, I belong to th’ larder.  PORTER. Belong to th’ gallows, and be hanged, ye rogue! Is this a place to roar in? Fetch me a dozen crab-tree staves, and strong ones. These are but switches to ’em. I’ll scratch your heads. You must be seeing christenings? Do you look for ale and cakes here, you rude rascals?  PORTER’S MAN. Pray, sir, be patient. ’Tis as much impossible— Unless we sweep ’em from the door with cannons— To scatter ’em as ’tis to make ’em sleep On May-day morning, which will never be. We may as well push against Paul’s as stir ’em.  PORTER. How got they in, and be hanged?  PORTER’S MAN. Alas, I know not. How gets the tide in? As much as one sound cudgel of four foot— You see the poor remainder—could distribute, I made no spare, sir.  PORTER. You did nothing, sir.  PORTER’S MAN. I am not Samson, nor Sir Guy, nor Colbrand, To mow ’em down before me; but if I spared any That had a head to hit, either young or old, He or she, cuckold or cuckold-maker, Let me ne’er hope to see a chine again— And that I would not for a cow, God save her!  ONE. [_Within_.] Do you hear, master porter?  PORTER. I shall be with you presently, good master puppy.— Keep the door close, sirrah.  PORTER’S MAN. What would you have me do?  PORTER. What should you do, but knock ’em down by th’ dozens? Is this Moorfields to muster in? Or have we some strange Indian with the great tool come to court, the women so besiege us? Bless me, what a fry of fornication is at door! On my Christian conscience, this one christening will beget a thousand; here will be father, godfather, and all together.  PORTER’S MAN. The spoons will be the bigger, sir. There is a fellow somewhat near the door—he should be a brazier by his face, for, o’ my conscience, twenty of the dog-days now reign in’s nose. All that stand about him are under the line; they need no other penance. That fire-drake did I hit three times on the head, and three times was his nose discharged against me. He stands there, like a mortar-piece, to blow us. There was a haberdasher’s wife of small wit near him that railed upon me till her pinked porringer fell off her head for kindling such a combustion in the state. I missed the meteor once and hit that woman, who cried out “Clubs!” when I might see from far some forty truncheoners draw to her succour, which were the hope o’ th’ Strand, where she was quartered. They fell on; I made good my place; at length they came to th’ broomstaff to me; I defied ’em still, when suddenly a file of boys behind ’em, loose shot, delivered such a shower of pebbles that I was fain to draw mine honour in and let ’em win the work. The devil was amongst ’em, I think, surely.  PORTER. These are the youths that thunder at a playhouse and fight for bitten apples, that no audience but the tribulation of Tower Hill or the limbs of Limehouse, their dear brothers, are able to endure. I have some of ’em in _Limbo Patrum_, and there they are like to dance these three days, besides the running banquet of two beadles that is to come.  Enter Lord Chamberlain.  CHAMBERLAIN. Mercy o’ me, what a multitude are here! They grow still too. From all parts they are coming, As if we kept a fair here! Where are these porters, These lazy knaves? You’ve made a fine hand, fellows! There’s a trim rabble let in. Are all these Your faithful friends o’ th’ suburbs? We shall have Great store of room, no doubt, left for the ladies, When they pass back from the christening.  PORTER. An’t please your honour, We are but men; and what so many may do, Not being torn a-pieces, we have done. An army cannot rule ’em.  CHAMBERLAIN. As I live, If the King blame me for’t, I’ll lay ye all By th’ heels, and suddenly, and on your heads Clap round fines for neglect. You’re lazy knaves, And here ye lie baiting of bombards, when Ye should do service. Hark, the trumpets sound! They’re come already from the christening. Go break among the press, and find a way out To let the troops pass fairly, or I’ll find A Marshalsea shall hold ye play these two months.  PORTER. Make way there for the Princess!  PORTER’S MAN. You great fellow, Stand close up, or I’ll make your head ache.  PORTER. You i’ th’ camlet, get up o’ th’ rail! I’ll peck you o’er the pales else.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IV. The palace.  Enter Trumpets, sounding; then two Aldermen, Lord Mayor, Garter, Cranmer, Duke of Norfolk with his marshal’s staff, Duke of Suffolk, two Noblemen bearing great standing bowls for the christening gifts; then four Noblemen bearing a canopy, under which the Duchess of Norfolk, godmother, bearing the child richly habited in a mantle, etc., train borne by a Lady; then follows the Marchioness Dorset, the other godmother, and Ladies. The troop pass once about the stage, and Garter speaks.  GARTER. Heaven, from thy endless goodness, send prosperous life, long and ever happy, to the high and mighty Princess of England, Elizabeth.  Flourish. Enter King and Guard.  CRANMER. [_Kneeling_.] And to your royal Grace and the good Queen, My noble partners and myself thus pray All comfort, joy, in this most gracious lady Heaven ever laid up to make parents happy May hourly fall upon ye!  KING. Thank you, good lord Archbishop. What is her name?  CRANMER. Elizabeth.  KING. Stand up, lord.  [_The King kisses the child._]  With this kiss take my blessing: God protect thee, Into whose hand I give thy life.  CRANMER. Amen.  KING. My noble gossips, you’ve have been too prodigal. I thank ye heartily; so shall this lady, When she has so much English.  CRANMER. Let me speak, sir, For heaven now bids me; and the words I utter Let none think flattery, for they’ll find ’em truth. This royal infant—heaven still move about her!— Though in her cradle, yet now promises Upon this land a thousand thousand blessings, Which time shall bring to ripeness. She shall be— But few now living can behold that goodness— A pattern to all princes living with her And all that shall succeed. Saba was never More covetous of wisdom and fair virtue Than this pure soul shall be. All princely graces That mould up such a mighty piece as this is, With all the virtues that attend the good, Shall still be doubled on her. Truth shall nurse her; Holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her. She shall be loved and feared. Her own shall bless her; Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn, And hang their heads with sorrow. Good grows with her. In her days every man shall eat in safety Under his own vine what he plants, and sing The merry songs of peace to all his neighbours. God shall be truly known, and those about her From her shall read the perfect ways of honour And by those claim their greatness, not by blood. Nor shall this peace sleep with her; but as when The bird of wonder dies, the maiden phoenix, Her ashes new create another heir As great in admiration as herself, So shall she leave her blessedness to one, When heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness, Who from the sacred ashes of her honour Shall star-like rise as great in fame as she was And so stand fixed. Peace, plenty, love, truth, terror, That were the servants to this chosen infant, Shall then be his, and like a vine grow to him. Wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine, His honour and the greatness of his name Shall be, and make new nations. He shall flourish, And, like a mountain cedar, reach his branches To all the plains about him. Our children’s children Shall see this and bless heaven.  KING. Thou speakest wonders.  CRANMER. She shall be to the happiness of England An aged princess; many days shall see her, And yet no day without a deed to crown it. Would I had known no more! But she must die, She must, the saints must have her; yet a virgin, A most unspotted lily, shall she pass to the ground, And all the world shall mourn her.  KING. O lord Archbishop, Thou hast made me now a man. Never before This happy child did I get anything. This oracle of comfort has so pleased me That when I am in heaven I shall desire To see what this child does and praise my Maker. I thank ye all. To you, my good Lord Mayor, And you, good brethren, I am much beholding. I have received much honour by your presence, And ye shall find me thankful. Lead the way, lords. Ye must all see the Queen, and she must thank ye; She will be sick else. This day, no man think ’Has business at his house, for all shall stay. This little one shall make it holiday.  [_Exeunt._]  Epilogue  Enter Epilogue.  EPILOGUE. ’Tis ten to one this play can never please All that are here. Some come to take their ease, And sleep an act or two—but those, we fear, We’ve frighted with our trumpets; so, ’tis clear, They’ll say ’tis naught—others, to hear the city Abused extremely and to cry “That’s witty!”— Which we have not done neither—that I fear All the expected good we’re like to hear For this play at this time is only in The merciful construction of good women, For such a one we showed ’em. If they smile And say ’twill do, I know within a while All the best men are ours; for ’tis ill hap If they hold when their ladies bid ’em clap.  [_Exit._]

  ACT I
SCENE I. Northampton. A Room of State in the Palace.  Enter King John, Queen Eleanor, Pembroke, Essex, Salisbury and others with Chatillion.  KING JOHN. Now, say, Chatillion, what would France with us?  CHATILLION. Thus, after greeting, speaks the King of France In my behaviour to the majesty, The borrow’d majesty, of England here.  QUEEN ELEANOR. A strange beginning: “borrow’d majesty”!  KING JOHN. Silence, good mother; hear the embassy.  CHATILLION. Philip of France, in right and true behalf Of thy deceased brother Geoffrey’s son, Arthur Plantagenet, lays most lawful claim To this fair island and the territories, To Ireland, Poitiers, Anjou, Touraine, Maine, Desiring thee to lay aside the sword Which sways usurpingly these several titles, And put the same into young Arthur’s hand, Thy nephew and right royal sovereign.  KING JOHN. What follows if we disallow of this?  CHATILLION. The proud control of fierce and bloody war, To enforce these rights so forcibly withheld.  KING JOHN. Here have we war for war and blood for blood, Controlment for controlment: so answer France.  CHATILLION. Then take my king’s defiance from my mouth, The farthest limit of my embassy.  KING JOHN. Bear mine to him, and so depart in peace. Be thou as lightning in the eyes of France, For ere thou canst report, I will be there, The thunder of my cannon shall be heard. So, hence! Be thou the trumpet of our wrath And sullen presage of your own decay.— An honourable conduct let him have. Pembroke, look to ’t. Farewell, Chatillion.  [_Exeunt Chatillion and Pembroke._]  QUEEN ELEANOR. What now, my son! Have I not ever said How that ambitious Constance would not cease Till she had kindled France and all the world Upon the right and party of her son? This might have been prevented and made whole With very easy arguments of love, Which now the manage of two kingdoms must With fearful bloody issue arbitrate.  KING JOHN. Our strong possession and our right for us.  QUEEN ELEANOR. Your strong possession much more than your right, Or else it must go wrong with you and me: So much my conscience whispers in your ear, Which none but heaven and you and I shall hear.  Enter a Sheriff, who whispers to Essex.  ESSEX. My liege, here is the strangest controversy, Come from the country to be judg’d by you, That e’er I heard. Shall I produce the men?  KING JOHN. Let them approach.  [_Exit Sheriff._]  Our abbeys and our priories shall pay This expedition’s charge.  Enter Robert Faulconbridge and Philip, his Bastard brother.  What men are you?  BASTARD. Your faithful subject I, a gentleman Born in Northamptonshire, and eldest son, As I suppose, to Robert Faulconbridge, A soldier by the honour-giving hand Of Cœur-de-lion knighted in the field.  KING JOHN. What art thou?  ROBERT. The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge.  KING JOHN. Is that the elder, and art thou the heir? You came not of one mother then, it seems.  BASTARD. Most certain of one mother, mighty king; That is well known; and, as I think, one father. But for the certain knowledge of that truth I put you o’er to heaven and to my mother. Of that I doubt, as all men’s children may.  QUEEN ELEANOR. Out on thee, rude man! Thou dost shame thy mother And wound her honour with this diffidence.  BASTARD. I, madam? No, I have no reason for it; That is my brother’s plea, and none of mine; The which if he can prove, he pops me out At least from fair five hundred pound a year. Heaven guard my mother’s honour and my land!  KING JOHN. A good blunt fellow. Why, being younger born, Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance?  BASTARD. I know not why, except to get the land. But once he slander’d me with bastardy. But whe’er I be as true begot or no, That still I lay upon my mother’s head; But that I am as well begot, my liege— Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me!— Compare our faces and be judge yourself. If old Sir Robert did beget us both And were our father, and this son like him, O old Sir Robert, father, on my knee I give heaven thanks I was not like to thee!  KING JOHN. Why, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!  QUEEN ELEANOR. He hath a trick of Cœur-de-lion’s face; The accent of his tongue affecteth him. Do you not read some tokens of my son In the large composition of this man?  KING JOHN. Mine eye hath well examined his parts And finds them perfect Richard. Sirrah, speak, What doth move you to claim your brother’s land?  BASTARD. Because he hath a half-face, like my father. With half that face would he have all my land: A half-fac’d groat five hundred pound a year!  ROBERT. My gracious liege, when that my father liv’d, Your brother did employ my father much—  BASTARD. Well, sir, by this you cannot get my land. Your tale must be how he employ’d my mother.  ROBERT. And once dispatch’d him in an embassy To Germany, there with the emperor To treat of high affairs touching that time. Th’ advantage of his absence took the King And in the meantime sojourn’d at my father’s; Where how he did prevail I shame to speak; But truth is truth: large lengths of seas and shores Between my father and my mother lay, As I have heard my father speak himself, When this same lusty gentleman was got. Upon his death-bed he by will bequeath’d His lands to me, and took it, on his death That this my mother’s son was none of his; And if he were, he came into the world Full fourteen weeks before the course of time. Then, good my liege, let me have what is mine, My father’s land, as was my father’s will.  KING JOHN. Sirrah, your brother is legitimate; Your father’s wife did after wedlock bear him, And if she did play false, the fault was hers; Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands That marry wives. Tell me, how if my brother, Who, as you say, took pains to get this son, Had of your father claim’d this son for his? In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept This calf, bred from his cow, from all the world; In sooth, he might; then, if he were my brother’s, My brother might not claim him; nor your father, Being none of his, refuse him. This concludes; My mother’s son did get your father’s heir; Your father’s heir must have your father’s land.  ROBERT. Shall then my father’s will be of no force To dispossess that child which is not his?  BASTARD. Of no more force to dispossess me, sir, Than was his will to get me, as I think.  QUEEN ELEANOR. Whether hadst thou rather be: a Faulconbridge And like thy brother, to enjoy thy land, Or the reputed son of Cœur-de-lion, Lord of thy presence and no land besides?  BASTARD. Madam, and if my brother had my shape And I had his, Sir Robert’s his, like him; And if my legs were two such riding-rods, My arms such eel-skins stuff’d, my face so thin That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose Lest men should say “Look where three-farthings goes!” And, to his shape, were heir to all this land, Would I might never stir from off this place, I would give it every foot to have this face. I would not be Sir Nob in any case.  QUEEN ELEANOR. I like thee well. Wilt thou forsake thy fortune, Bequeath thy land to him, and follow me? I am a soldier and now bound to France.  BASTARD. Brother, take you my land, I’ll take my chance. Your face hath got five hundred pound a year, Yet sell your face for five pence and ’tis dear. Madam, I’ll follow you unto the death.  QUEEN ELEANOR. Nay, I would have you go before me thither.  BASTARD. Our country manners give our betters way.  KING JOHN. What is thy name?  BASTARD. Philip, my liege, so is my name begun; Philip, good old Sir Robert’s wife’s eldest son.  KING JOHN. From henceforth bear his name whose form thou bearest. Kneel thou down Philip, but rise more great, Arise Sir Richard and Plantagenet.  BASTARD. Brother by th’ mother’s side, give me your hand. My father gave me honour, yours gave land. Now blessed be the hour, by night or day, When I was got, Sir Robert was away!  QUEEN ELEANOR. The very spirit of Plantagenet! I am thy grandam, Richard; call me so.  BASTARD. Madam, by chance but not by truth; what though? Something about, a little from the right, In at the window, or else o’er the hatch. Who dares not stir by day must walk by night, And have is have, however men do catch. Near or far off, well won is still well shot, And I am I, howe’er I was begot.  KING JOHN. Go, Faulconbridge; now hast thou thy desire. A landless knight makes thee a landed squire. Come, madam, and come, Richard, we must speed For France, for France, for it is more than need.  BASTARD. Brother, adieu, good fortune come to thee! For thou wast got i’ th’ way of honesty.  [_Exeunt all but the Bastard._]  A foot of honour better than I was, But many a many foot of land the worse. Well, now can I make any Joan a lady. “Good den, Sir Richard!” “God-a-mercy, fellow!” And if his name be George, I’ll call him Peter; For new-made honour doth forget men’s names: ’Tis too respective and too sociable For your conversion. Now your traveller, He and his toothpick at my worship’s mess, And when my knightly stomach is suffic’d, Why then I suck my teeth and catechize My picked man of countries: “My dear sir,” Thus leaning on mine elbow I begin, “I shall beseech you”—that is Question now; And then comes Answer like an absey book: “O sir,” says Answer “at your best command; At your employment; at your service, sir.” “No, sir,” says Question, “I, sweet sir, at yours.” And so, ere Answer knows what Question would, Saving in dialogue of compliment, And talking of the Alps and Apennines, The Pyrenean and the river Po, It draws toward supper in conclusion so. But this is worshipful society, And fits the mounting spirit like myself; For he is but a bastard to the time That doth not smack of observation, And so am I, whether I smack or no; And not alone in habit and device, Exterior form, outward accoutrement, But from the inward motion to deliver Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age’s tooth, Which, though I will not practise to deceive, Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn; For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising. But who comes in such haste in riding-robes? What woman-post is this? Hath she no husband That will take pains to blow a horn before her?  Enter Lady Faulconbridge and James Gurney.  O me, ’tis my mother!—How now, good lady? What brings you here to court so hastily?  LADY FAULCONBRIDGE. Where is that slave, thy brother? Where is he That holds in chase mine honour up and down?  BASTARD. My brother Robert, old Sir Robert’s son? Colbrand the giant, that same mighty man? Is it Sir Robert’s son that you seek so?  LADY FAULCONBRIDGE. Sir Robert’s son! Ay, thou unreverend boy, Sir Robert’s son. Why scorn’st thou at Sir Robert? He is Sir Robert’s son, and so art thou.  BASTARD. James Gurney, wilt thou give us leave awhile?  GURNEY. Good leave, good Philip.  BASTARD. Philip?—sparrow!—James, There’s toys abroad. Anon I’ll tell thee more.  [_Exit Gurney._]  Madam, I was not old Sir Robert’s son. Sir Robert might have eat his part in me Upon Good Friday, and ne’er broke his fast. Sir Robert could do well—marry, to confess— Could … get me. Sir Robert could not do it. We know his handiwork. Therefore, good mother, To whom am I beholding for these limbs? Sir Robert never holp to make this leg.  LADY FAULCONBRIDGE. Hast thou conspired with thy brother too, That for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honour? What means this scorn, thou most untoward knave?  BASTARD. Knight, knight, good mother, Basilisco-like. What! I am dubb’d! I have it on my shoulder. But, mother, I am not Sir Robert’s son. I have disclaim’d Sir Robert and my land; Legitimation, name, and all is gone. Then, good my mother, let me know my father— Some proper man, I hope. Who was it, mother?  LADY FAULCONBRIDGE. Hast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge?  BASTARD. As faithfully as I deny the devil.  LADY FAULCONBRIDGE. King Richard Cœur-de-lion was thy father. By long and vehement suit I was seduc’d To make room for him in my husband’s bed. Heaven lay not my transgression to my charge! Thou art the issue of my dear offence, Which was so strongly urg’d, past my defence.  BASTARD. Now, by this light, were I to get again, Madam, I would not wish a better father. Some sins do bear their privilege on earth, And so doth yours. Your fault was not your folly. Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose, Subjected tribute to commanding love, Against whose fury and unmatched force The aweless lion could not wage the fight, Nor keep his princely heart from Richard’s hand. He that perforce robs lions of their hearts May easily win a woman’s. Ay, my mother, With all my heart I thank thee for my father! Who lives and dares but say thou didst not well When I was got, I’ll send his soul to hell. Come, lady, I will show thee to my kin; And they shall say when Richard me begot, If thou hadst said him nay, it had been sin. Who says it was, he lies. I say ’twas not.  [_Exeunt._]

  ACT V
SCENE I. Northampton. A Room in the Palace.  Enter King John, Pandulph with the crown, and Attendants.  KING JOHN. Thus have I yielded up into your hand The circle of my glory.  PANDULPH. [_Giving King John the crown._] Take again From this my hand, as holding of the pope, Your sovereign greatness and authority.  KING JOHN. Now keep your holy word. Go meet the French, And from his holiness use all your power To stop their marches ’fore we are inflam’d. Our discontented counties do revolt; Our people quarrel with obedience, Swearing allegiance and the love of soul To stranger blood, to foreign royalty. This inundation of mistemper’d humour Rests by you only to be qualified. Then pause not; for the present time’s so sick That present med’cine must be minist’red Or overthrow incurable ensues.  PANDULPH. It was my breath that blew this tempest up, Upon your stubborn usage of the pope; But since you are a gentle convertite, My tongue shall hush again this storm of war And make fair weather in your blust’ring land. On this Ascension-day, remember well, Upon your oath of service to the pope, Go I to make the French lay down their arms.  [_Exit._]  KING JOHN. Is this Ascension-day? Did not the prophet Say that before Ascension-day at noon My crown I should give off? Even so I have. I did suppose it should be on constraint; But, heaven be thank’d, it is but voluntary.  Enter the Bastard.  BASTARD. All Kent hath yielded. Nothing there holds out But Dover Castle. London hath receiv’d, Like a kind host, the Dauphin and his powers. Your nobles will not hear you, but are gone To offer service to your enemy; And wild amazement hurries up and down The little number of your doubtful friends.  KING JOHN. Would not my lords return to me again After they heard young Arthur was alive?  BASTARD. They found him dead and cast into the streets, An empty casket, where the jewel of life By some damn’d hand was robb’d and ta’en away.  KING JOHN. That villain Hubert told me he did live.  BASTARD. So, on my soul, he did, for aught he knew. But wherefore do you droop? Why look you sad? Be great in act, as you have been in thought; Let not the world see fear and sad distrust Govern the motion of a kingly eye. Be stirring as the time; be fire with fire; Threaten the threat’ner, and outface the brow Of bragging horror. So shall inferior eyes, That borrow their behaviours from the great, Grow great by your example and put on The dauntless spirit of resolution. Away, and glister like the god of war When he intendeth to become the field. Show boldness and aspiring confidence. What, shall they seek the lion in his den, And fright him there? And make him tremble there? O, let it not be said! Forage, and run To meet displeasure farther from the doors, And grapple with him ere he come so nigh.  KING JOHN. The legate of the pope hath been with me, And I have made a happy peace with him; And he hath promis’d to dismiss the powers Led by the Dauphin.  BASTARD. O inglorious league! Shall we, upon the footing of our land, Send fair-play orders and make compromise, Insinuation, parley, and base truce To arms invasive? Shall a beardless boy, A cocker’d silken wanton, brave our fields, And flesh his spirit in a warlike soil, Mocking the air with colours idly spread, And find no check? Let us, my liege, to arms! Perchance the cardinal cannot make your peace; Or if he do, let it at least be said They saw we had a purpose of defence.  KING JOHN. Have thou the ordering of this present time.  BASTARD. Away, then, with good courage! Yet, I know Our party may well meet a prouder foe.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. Near Saint Edmundsbury. The French Camp.  Enter, in arms, Louis, Salisbury, Melun, Pembroke, Bigot and soldiers.  LOUIS. My Lord Melun, let this be copied out, And keep it safe for our remembrance. Return the precedent to these lords again; That, having our fair order written down, Both they and we, perusing o’er these notes, May know wherefore we took the sacrament, And keep our faiths firm and inviolable.  SALISBURY. Upon our sides it never shall be broken. And, noble Dauphin, albeit we swear A voluntary zeal and an unurg’d faith To your proceedings; yet believe me, prince, I am not glad that such a sore of time Should seek a plaster by contemn’d revolt, And heal the inveterate canker of one wound By making many. O, it grieves my soul That I must draw this metal from my side To be a widow-maker! O, and there Where honourable rescue and defence Cries out upon the name of Salisbury! But such is the infection of the time, That, for the health and physic of our right, We cannot deal but with the very hand Of stern injustice and confused wrong. And is’t not pity, O my grieved friends, That we, the sons and children of this isle, Were born to see so sad an hour as this; Wherein we step after a stranger, march Upon her gentle bosom, and fill up Her enemies’ ranks? I must withdraw and weep Upon the spot of this enforced cause, To grace the gentry of a land remote, And follow unacquainted colours here. What, here? O nation, that thou couldst remove! That Neptune’s arms, who clippeth thee about, Would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself And grapple thee unto a pagan shore, Where these two Christian armies might combine The blood of malice in a vein of league, And not to spend it so unneighbourly!  LOUIS. A noble temper dost thou show in this; And great affections wrestling in thy bosom Doth make an earthquake of nobility. O, what a noble combat hast thou fought Between compulsion and a brave respect! Let me wipe off this honourable dew That silverly doth progress on thy cheeks. My heart hath melted at a lady’s tears, Being an ordinary inundation; But this effusion of such manly drops, This shower, blown up by tempest of the soul, Startles mine eyes and makes me more amaz’d Than had I seen the vaulty top of heaven Figur’d quite o’er with burning meteors. Lift up thy brow, renowned Salisbury, And with a great heart heave away this storm. Commend these waters to those baby eyes That never saw the giant world enrag’d, Nor met with fortune other than at feasts, Full of warm blood, of mirth, of gossiping. Come, come; for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep Into the purse of rich prosperity As Louis himself.—So, nobles, shall you all, That knit your sinews to the strength of mine. And even there, methinks, an angel spake.  Enter Pandulph.  Look, where the holy legate comes apace, To give us warrant from the hand of heaven, And on our actions set the name of right With holy breath.  PANDULPH. Hail, noble prince of France! The next is this: King John hath reconcil’d Himself to Rome; his spirit is come in, That so stood out against the holy church, The great metropolis and see of Rome. Therefore thy threat’ning colours now wind up, And tame the savage spirit of wild war, That, like a lion foster’d up at hand, It may lie gently at the foot of peace And be no further harmful than in show.  LOUIS. Your grace shall pardon me, I will not back. I am too high-born to be propertied, To be a secondary at control, Or useful serving-man and instrument To any sovereign state throughout the world. Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars Between this chastis’d kingdom and myself, And brought in matter that should feed this fire; And now ’tis far too huge to be blown out With that same weak wind which enkindled it. You taught me how to know the face of right, Acquainted me with interest to this land, Yea, thrust this enterprise into my heart; And come ye now to tell me John hath made His peace with Rome? What is that peace to me? I, by the honour of my marriage-bed, After young Arthur, claim this land for mine; And, now it is half-conquer’d, must I back Because that John hath made his peace with Rome? Am I Rome’s slave? What penny hath Rome borne, What men provided, what munition sent, To underprop this action? Is’t not I That undergo this charge? Who else but I, And such as to my claim are liable, Sweat in this business and maintain this war? Have I not heard these islanders shout out _Vive le Roi!_ as I have bank’d their towns? Have I not here the best cards for the game To win this easy match play’d for a crown? And shall I now give o’er the yielded set? No, no, on my soul, it never shall be said.  PANDULPH. You look but on the outside of this work.  LOUIS. Outside or inside, I will not return Till my attempt so much be glorified As to my ample hope was promised Before I drew this gallant head of war, And cull’d these fiery spirits from the world, To outlook conquest and to win renown Even in the jaws of danger and of death.  [_Trumpet sounds._]  What lusty trumpet thus doth summon us?  Enter the Bastard, attended.  BASTARD. According to the fair play of the world, Let me have audience; I am sent to speak, My holy lord of Milan, from the King I come to learn how you have dealt for him; And, as you answer, I do know the scope And warrant limited unto my tongue.  PANDULPH. The Dauphin is too wilful-opposite, And will not temporize with my entreaties; He flatly says he’ll not lay down his arms.  BASTARD. By all the blood that ever fury breath’d, The youth says well. Now hear our English king, For thus his royalty doth speak in me: He is prepar’d, and reason too he should. This apish and unmannerly approach, This harness’d masque and unadvised revel, This unhair’d sauciness and boyish troops, The King doth smile at; and is well prepar’d To whip this dwarfish war, these pigmy arms, From out the circle of his territories. That hand which had the strength, even at your door, To cudgel you and make you take the hatch, To dive like buckets in concealed wells, To crouch in litter of your stable planks, To lie like pawns lock’d up in chests and trunks, To hug with swine, to seek sweet safety out In vaults and prisons, and to thrill and shake Even at the crying of your nation’s crow, Thinking this voice an armed Englishman; Shall that victorious hand be feebled here That in your chambers gave you chastisement? No! Know the gallant monarch is in arms And like an eagle o’er his aery towers To souse annoyance that comes near his nest.— And you degenerate, you ingrate revolts, You bloody Neroes, ripping up the womb Of your dear mother England, blush for shame! For your own ladies and pale-visag’d maids Like Amazons come tripping after drums, Their thimbles into armed gauntlets change, Their needles to lances, and their gentle hearts To fierce and bloody inclination.  LOUIS. There end thy brave, and turn thy face in peace; We grant thou canst outscold us. Fare thee well; We hold our time too precious to be spent With such a brabbler.  PANDULPH. Give me leave to speak.  BASTARD. No, I will speak.  LOUIS. We will attend to neither. Strike up the drums; and let the tongue of war, Plead for our interest and our being here.  BASTARD. Indeed, your drums, being beaten, will cry out; And so shall you, being beaten. Do but start And echo with the clamour of thy drum, And even at hand a drum is ready brac’d That shall reverberate all as loud as thine. Sound but another, and another shall, As loud as thine, rattle the welkin’s ear And mock the deep-mouth’d thunder. For at hand, Not trusting to this halting legate here, Whom he hath us’d rather for sport than need, Is warlike John; and in his forehead sits A bare-ribb’d death, whose office is this day To feast upon whole thousands of the French.  LOUIS. Strike up our drums, to find this danger out.  BASTARD. And thou shalt find it, Dauphin, do not doubt.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. The same. The Field of Battle.  Alarums. Enter King John and Hubert.  KING JOHN. How goes the day with us? O, tell me, Hubert.  HUBERT. Badly, I fear. How fares your majesty?  KING JOHN. This fever that hath troubled me so long Lies heavy on me. O, my heart is sick!  Enter a Messenger.  MESSENGER. My lord, your valiant kinsman, Faulconbridge, Desires your majesty to leave the field And send him word by me which way you go.  KING JOHN. Tell him, toward Swinstead, to the abbey there.  MESSENGER. Be of good comfort; for the great supply That was expected by the Dauphin here Are wrack’d three nights ago on Goodwin Sands. This news was brought to Richard but even now. The French fight coldly, and retire themselves.  KING JOHN. Ay me, this tyrant fever burns me up And will not let me welcome this good news. Set on toward Swinstead. To my litter straight. Weakness possesseth me, and I am faint.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IV. The same. Another part of the same.  Enter Salisbury, Pembroke and Bigot.  SALISBURY. I did not think the King so stor’d with friends.  PEMBROKE. Up once again; put spirit in the French. If they miscarry, we miscarry too.  SALISBURY. That misbegotten devil, Faulconbridge, In spite of spite, alone upholds the day.  PEMBROKE. They say King John, sore sick, hath left the field.  Enter Melun wounded, and led by Soldiers.  MELUN. Lead me to the revolts of England here.  SALISBURY. When we were happy we had other names.  PEMBROKE. It is the Count Melun.  SALISBURY. Wounded to death.  MELUN. Fly, noble English, you are bought and sold; Unthread the rude eye of rebellion And welcome home again discarded faith. Seek out King John and fall before his feet; For if the French be lords of this loud day, He means to recompense the pains you take By cutting off your heads. Thus hath he sworn, And I with him, and many more with me, Upon the altar at Saint Edmundsbury; Even on that altar where we swore to you Dear amity and everlasting love.  SALISBURY. May this be possible? May this be true?  MELUN. Have I not hideous death within my view, Retaining but a quantity of life, Which bleeds away even as a form of wax Resolveth from his figure ’gainst the fire? What in the world should make me now deceive, Since I must lose the use of all deceit? Why should I then be false, since it is true That I must die here and live hence by truth? I say again, if Louis do win the day, He is forsworn if e’er those eyes of yours Behold another day break in the east. But even this night, whose black contagious breath Already smokes about the burning crest Of the old, feeble, and day-wearied sun, Even this ill night, your breathing shall expire, Paying the fine of rated treachery Even with a treacherous fine of all your lives, If Louis by your assistance win the day. Commend me to one Hubert, with your king; The love of him, and this respect besides, For that my grandsire was an Englishman, Awakes my conscience to confess all this. In lieu whereof, I pray you, bear me hence From forth the noise and rumour of the field, Where I may think the remnant of my thoughts In peace, and part this body and my soul With contemplation and devout desires.  SALISBURY. We do believe thee, and beshrew my soul But I do love the favour and the form Of this most fair occasion, by the which We will untread the steps of damned flight, And like a bated and retired flood, Leaving our rankness and irregular course, Stoop low within those bounds we have o’erlook’d, And calmly run on in obedience Even to our ocean, to our great King John. My arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence; For I do see the cruel pangs of death Right in thine eye.—Away, my friends! New flight, And happy newness, that intends old right.  [_Exeunt, leading off Melun._]  SCENE V. The same. The French camp.  Enter Louis and his train.  LOUIS. The sun of heaven, methought, was loath to set, But stay’d, and made the western welkin blush, When the English measure backward their own ground In faint retire. O, bravely came we off, When with a volley of our needless shot, After such bloody toil, we bid good night, And wound our tott’ring colours clearly up, Last in the field, and almost lords of it!  Enter a Messenger.  MESSENGER. Where is my prince, the Dauphin?  LOUIS. Here. What news?  MESSENGER. The Count Melun is slain; the English lords By his persuasion are again fall’n off, And your supply, which you have wish’d so long, Are cast away and sunk on Goodwin Sands.  LOUIS. Ah, foul shrewd news! Beshrew thy very heart! I did not think to be so sad tonight As this hath made me. Who was he that said King John did fly an hour or two before The stumbling night did part our weary powers?  MESSENGER. Whoever spoke it, it is true, my lord.  LOUIS. Well, keep good quarter and good care tonight. The day shall not be up so soon as I, To try the fair adventure of tomorrow.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE VI. An open place in the neighborhood of Swinstead Abbey.  Enter the Bastard and Hubert, meeting.  HUBERT. Who’s there? Speak, ho! Speak quickly, or I shoot.  BASTARD. A friend. What art thou?  HUBERT. Of the part of England.  BASTARD. Whither dost thou go?  HUBERT. What’s that to thee? Why may I not demand Of thine affairs, as well as thou of mine?  BASTARD. Hubert, I think.  HUBERT. Thou hast a perfect thought. I will, upon all hazards, well believe Thou art my friend, that know’st my tongue so well. Who art thou?  BASTARD. Who thou wilt. And if thou please, Thou mayst befriend me so much as to think I come one way of the Plantagenets.  HUBERT. Unkind remembrance! Thou and eyeless night Have done me shame. Brave soldier, pardon me, That any accent breaking from thy tongue Should ’scape the true acquaintance of mine ear.  BASTARD. Come, come; sans compliment, what news abroad?  HUBERT. Why, here walk I in the black brow of night, To find you out.  BASTARD. Brief, then; and what’s the news?  HUBERT. O, my sweet sir, news fitting to the night, Black, fearful, comfortless, and horrible.  BASTARD. Show me the very wound of this ill news. I am no woman, I’ll not swoon at it.  HUBERT. The King, I fear, is poison’d by a monk. I left him almost speechless, and broke out To acquaint you with this evil, that you might The better arm you to the sudden time, Than if you had at leisure known of this.  BASTARD. How did he take it? Who did taste to him?  HUBERT. A monk, I tell you, a resolved villain, Whose bowels suddenly burst out. The King Yet speaks, and peradventure may recover.  BASTARD. Who didst thou leave to tend his majesty?  HUBERT. Why, know you not? The lords are all come back, And brought Prince Henry in their company; At whose request the King hath pardon’d them, And they are all about his majesty.  BASTARD. Withhold thine indignation, mighty heaven, And tempt us not to bear above our power! I’ll tell thee, Hubert, half my power this night, Passing these flats, are taken by the tide; These Lincoln Washes have devoured them; Myself, well mounted, hardly have escap’d. Away, before. Conduct me to the King; I doubt he will be dead or ere I come.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE VII. The orchard of Swinstead Abbey.  Enter Prince Henry, Salisbury and Bigot.  PRINCE HENRY. It is too late. The life of all his blood Is touch’d corruptibly, and his pure brain, Which some suppose the soul’s frail dwelling-house, Doth, by the idle comments that it makes, Foretell the ending of mortality.  Enter Pembroke.  PEMBROKE. His Highness yet doth speak, and holds belief That, being brought into the open air, It would allay the burning quality Of that fell poison which assaileth him.  PRINCE HENRY. Let him be brought into the orchard here. Doth he still rage?  [_Exit Bigot._]  PEMBROKE. He is more patient Than when you left him; even now he sung.  PRINCE HENRY. O vanity of sickness! Fierce extremes In their continuance will not feel themselves. Death, having prey’d upon the outward parts, Leaves them invisible, and his siege is now Against the mind, the which he pricks and wounds With many legions of strange fantasies, Which, in their throng and press to that last hold, Confound themselves. ’Tis strange that death should sing. I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan, Who chants a doleful hymn to his own death And from the organ-pipe of frailty sings His soul and body to their lasting rest.  SALISBURY. Be of good comfort, prince; for you are born To set a form upon that indigest Which he hath left so shapeless and so rude.  Enter Bigot and Attendants, who bring in King John in a chair.  KING JOHN. Ay, marry, now my soul hath elbow-room It would not out at windows nor at doors. There is so hot a summer in my bosom That all my bowels crumble up to dust. I am a scribbled form, drawn with a pen Upon a parchment, and against this fire Do I shrink up.  PRINCE HENRY. How fares your majesty?  KING JOHN. Poison’d, ill fare; dead, forsook, cast off, And none of you will bid the winter come To thrust his icy fingers in my maw, Nor let my kingdom’s rivers take their course Through my burn’d bosom, nor entreat the north To make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips And comfort me with cold. I do not ask you much, I beg cold comfort; and you are so strait, And so ingrateful, you deny me that.  PRINCE HENRY. O, that there were some virtue in my tears That might relieve you!  KING JOHN. The salt in them is hot. Within me is a hell; and there the poison Is, as a fiend, confin’d to tyrannize On unreprievable condemned blood.  Enter the Bastard.  BASTARD. O, I am scalded with my violent motion And spleen of speed to see your majesty!  KING JOHN. O cousin, thou art come to set mine eye. The tackle of my heart is crack’d and burn’d, And all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail Are turned to one thread, one little hair. My heart hath one poor string to stay it by, Which holds but till thy news be uttered; And then all this thou seest is but a clod And module of confounded royalty.  BASTARD. The Dauphin is preparing hitherward, Where God He knows how we shall answer him; For in a night the best part of my power, As I upon advantage did remove, Were in the Washes all unwarily Devoured by the unexpected flood.  [_The King dies._]  SALISBURY. You breathe these dead news in as dead an ear. My liege! My lord!—But now a king, now thus.  PRINCE HENRY. Even so must I run on, and even so stop. What surety of the world, what hope, what stay, When this was now a king, and now is clay?  BASTARD. Art thou gone so? I do but stay behind To do the office for thee of revenge, And then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven, As it on earth hath been thy servant still. Now, now, you stars that move in your right spheres, Where be your powers? Show now your mended faiths, And instantly return with me again, To push destruction and perpetual shame Out of the weak door of our fainting land. Straight let us seek, or straight we shall be sought; The Dauphin rages at our very heels.  SALISBURY. It seems you know not, then, so much as we. The Cardinal Pandulph is within at rest, Who half an hour since came from the Dauphin, And brings from him such offers of our peace As we with honour and respect may take, With purpose presently to leave this war.  BASTARD. He will the rather do it when he sees Ourselves well sinewed to our defence.  SALISBURY. Nay, ’tis in a manner done already, For many carriages he hath dispatch’d To the sea-side, and put his cause and quarrel To the disposing of the cardinal, With whom yourself, myself, and other lords, If you think meet, this afternoon will post To consummate this business happily.  BASTARD. Let it be so. And you, my noble prince, With other princes that may best be spar’d, Shall wait upon your father’s funeral.  PRINCE HENRY. At Worcester must his body be interr’d; For so he will’d it.  BASTARD. Thither shall it, then, And happily may your sweet self put on The lineal state and glory of the land! To whom, with all submission, on my knee, I do bequeath my faithful services And true subjection everlastingly.  SALISBURY. And the like tender of our love we make, To rest without a spot for evermore.  PRINCE HENRY. I have a kind soul that would give you thanks And knows not how to do it but with tears.  BASTARD. O, let us pay the time but needful woe, Since it hath been beforehand with our griefs. This England never did, nor never shall, Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror, But when it first did help to wound itself. Now these her princes are come home again, Come the three corners of the world in arms And we shall shock them. Nought shall make us rue, If England to itself do rest but true.  [_Exeunt._]

  ACT I  SCENE I. Rome. A street.
  ACT II  SCENE I. Rome. Brutus’ orchard.
Enter Brutus.  BRUTUS. What, Lucius, ho! I cannot, by the progress of the stars, Give guess how near to day.—Lucius, I say! I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly. When, Lucius, when? Awake, I say! What, Lucius!  Enter Lucius.  LUCIUS. Call’d you, my lord?  BRUTUS. Get me a taper in my study, Lucius: When it is lighted, come and call me here.  LUCIUS. I will, my lord.  [_Exit._]  BRUTUS. It must be by his death: and for my part, I know no personal cause to spurn at him, But for the general. He would be crown’d: How that might change his nature, there’s the question. It is the bright day that brings forth the adder, And that craves wary walking. Crown him?—that; And then, I grant, we put a sting in him, That at his will he may do danger with. Th’ abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins Remorse from power; and, to speak truth of Caesar, I have not known when his affections sway’d More than his reason. But ’tis a common proof, That lowliness is young ambition’s ladder, Whereto the climber-upward turns his face; But when he once attains the upmost round, He then unto the ladder turns his back, Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees By which he did ascend. So Caesar may; Then lest he may, prevent. And since the quarrel Will bear no colour for the thing he is, Fashion it thus: that what he is, augmented, Would run to these and these extremities: And therefore think him as a serpent’s egg Which hatch’d, would, as his kind grow mischievous; And kill him in the shell.  Enter Lucius.  LUCIUS. The taper burneth in your closet, sir. Searching the window for a flint, I found This paper, thus seal’d up, and I am sure It did not lie there when I went to bed.  [_Gives him the letter._]  BRUTUS. Get you to bed again; it is not day. Is not tomorrow, boy, the Ides of March?  LUCIUS. I know not, sir.  BRUTUS. Look in the calendar, and bring me word.  LUCIUS. I will, sir.  [_Exit._]  BRUTUS. The exhalations, whizzing in the air Give so much light that I may read by them.  [_Opens the letter and reads._]  _Brutus, thou sleep’st: awake and see thyself. Shall Rome, &c. Speak, strike, redress!_ “Brutus, thou sleep’st: awake!” Such instigations have been often dropp’d Where I have took them up. “Shall Rome, &c.” Thus must I piece it out: Shall Rome stand under one man’s awe? What, Rome? My ancestors did from the streets of Rome The Tarquin drive, when he was call’d a king. “Speak, strike, redress!” Am I entreated To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise, If the redress will follow, thou receivest Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus.  Enter Lucius.  LUCIUS. Sir, March is wasted fifteen days.  [_Knock within._]  BRUTUS. ’Tis good. Go to the gate, somebody knocks.  [_Exit Lucius._]  Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar, I have not slept. Between the acting of a dreadful thing And the first motion, all the interim is Like a phantasma, or a hideous dream: The genius and the mortal instruments Are then in council; and the state of man, Like to a little kingdom, suffers then The nature of an insurrection.  Enter Lucius.  LUCIUS. Sir, ’tis your brother Cassius at the door, Who doth desire to see you.  BRUTUS. Is he alone?  LUCIUS. No, sir, there are moe with him.  BRUTUS. Do you know them?  LUCIUS. No, sir, their hats are pluck’d about their ears, And half their faces buried in their cloaks, That by no means I may discover them By any mark of favour.  BRUTUS. Let ’em enter.  [_Exit Lucius._]  They are the faction. O conspiracy, Sham’st thou to show thy dangerous brow by night, When evils are most free? O, then, by day Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, conspiracy; Hide it in smiles and affability: For if thou path, thy native semblance on, Not Erebus itself were dim enough To hide thee from prevention.  Enter Cassius, Casca, Decius, Cinna, Metellus Cimber and Trebonius.  CASSIUS. I think we are too bold upon your rest: Good morrow, Brutus; do we trouble you?  BRUTUS. I have been up this hour, awake all night. Know I these men that come along with you?  CASSIUS. Yes, every man of them; and no man here But honours you; and everyone doth wish You had but that opinion of yourself Which every noble Roman bears of you. This is Trebonius.  BRUTUS. He is welcome hither.  CASSIUS. This Decius Brutus.  BRUTUS. He is welcome too.  CASSIUS. This, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber.  BRUTUS. They are all welcome. What watchful cares do interpose themselves Betwixt your eyes and night?  CASSIUS. Shall I entreat a word?  [_They whisper._]  DECIUS. Here lies the east: doth not the day break here?  CASCA. No.  CINNA. O, pardon, sir, it doth; and yon grey lines That fret the clouds are messengers of day.  CASCA. You shall confess that you are both deceiv’d. Here, as I point my sword, the Sun arises; Which is a great way growing on the South, Weighing the youthful season of the year. Some two months hence, up higher toward the North He first presents his fire; and the high East Stands, as the Capitol, directly here.  BRUTUS. Give me your hands all over, one by one.  CASSIUS. And let us swear our resolution.  BRUTUS. No, not an oath. If not the face of men, The sufferance of our souls, the time’s abuse— If these be motives weak, break off betimes, And every man hence to his idle bed. So let high-sighted tyranny range on, Till each man drop by lottery. But if these, As I am sure they do, bear fire enough To kindle cowards, and to steel with valour The melting spirits of women; then, countrymen, What need we any spur but our own cause To prick us to redress? what other bond Than secret Romans, that have spoke the word, And will not palter? and what other oath Than honesty to honesty engag’d, That this shall be, or we will fall for it? Swear priests and cowards, and men cautelous, Old feeble carrions, and such suffering souls That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain The even virtue of our enterprise, Nor th’ insuppressive mettle of our spirits, To think that or our cause or our performance Did need an oath; when every drop of blood That every Roman bears, and nobly bears, Is guilty of a several bastardy, If he do break the smallest particle Of any promise that hath pass’d from him.  CASSIUS. But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him? I think he will stand very strong with us.  CASCA. Let us not leave him out.  CINNA. No, by no means.  METELLUS. O, let us have him, for his silver hairs Will purchase us a good opinion, And buy men’s voices to commend our deeds. It shall be said, his judgement rul’d our hands; Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear, But all be buried in his gravity.  BRUTUS. O, name him not; let us not break with him; For he will never follow anything That other men begin.  CASSIUS. Then leave him out.  CASCA. Indeed, he is not fit.  DECIUS. Shall no man else be touch’d but only Caesar?  CASSIUS. Decius, well urg’d. I think it is not meet, Mark Antony, so well belov’d of Caesar, Should outlive Caesar: we shall find of him A shrewd contriver; and you know, his means, If he improve them, may well stretch so far As to annoy us all; which to prevent, Let Antony and Caesar fall together.  BRUTUS. Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius, To cut the head off, and then hack the limbs, Like wrath in death, and envy afterwards; For Antony is but a limb of Caesar. Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius. We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar, And in the spirit of men there is no blood. O, that we then could come by Caesar’s spirit, And not dismember Caesar! But, alas, Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends, Let’s kill him boldly, but not wrathfully; Let’s carve him as a dish fit for the gods, Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds. And let our hearts, as subtle masters do, Stir up their servants to an act of rage, And after seem to chide ’em. This shall mark Our purpose necessary, and not envious; Which so appearing to the common eyes, We shall be call’d purgers, not murderers. And for Mark Antony, think not of him; For he can do no more than Caesar’s arm When Caesar’s head is off.  CASSIUS. Yet I fear him; For in the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar—  BRUTUS. Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him: If he love Caesar, all that he can do Is to himself; take thought and die for Caesar. And that were much he should; for he is given To sports, to wildness, and much company.  TREBONIUS. There is no fear in him; let him not die; For he will live, and laugh at this hereafter.  [_Clock strikes._]  BRUTUS. Peace! count the clock.  CASSIUS. The clock hath stricken three.  TREBONIUS. ’Tis time to part.  CASSIUS. But it is doubtful yet Whether Caesar will come forth today or no; For he is superstitious grown of late, Quite from the main opinion he held once Of fantasy, of dreams, and ceremonies. It may be these apparent prodigies, The unaccustom’d terror of this night, And the persuasion of his augurers, May hold him from the Capitol today.  DECIUS. Never fear that: if he be so resolved, I can o’ersway him, for he loves to hear That unicorns may be betray’d with trees, And bears with glasses, elephants with holes, Lions with toils, and men with flatterers. But when I tell him he hates flatterers, He says he does, being then most flattered. Let me work; For I can give his humour the true bent, And I will bring him to the Capitol.  CASSIUS. Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.  BRUTUS. By the eighth hour: is that the uttermost?  CINNA. Be that the uttermost; and fail not then.  METELLUS. Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard, Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey; I wonder none of you have thought of him.  BRUTUS. Now, good Metellus, go along by him: He loves me well, and I have given him reason; Send him but hither, and I’ll fashion him.  CASSIUS. The morning comes upon’s. We’ll leave you, Brutus. And, friends, disperse yourselves; but all remember What you have said, and show yourselves true Romans.  BRUTUS. Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily; Let not our looks put on our purposes, But bear it as our Roman actors do, With untired spirits and formal constancy. And so, good morrow to you everyone.  [_Exeunt all but Brutus._]  Boy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter; Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber: Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies, Which busy care draws in the brains of men; Therefore thou sleep’st so sound.  Enter Portia.  PORTIA. Brutus, my lord.  BRUTUS. Portia, what mean you? Wherefore rise you now? It is not for your health thus to commit Your weak condition to the raw cold morning.  PORTIA. Nor for yours neither. Y’ have ungently, Brutus, Stole from my bed; and yesternight at supper, You suddenly arose, and walk’d about, Musing and sighing, with your arms across; And when I ask’d you what the matter was, You star’d upon me with ungentle looks. I urg’d you further; then you scratch’d your head, And too impatiently stamp’d with your foot; Yet I insisted, yet you answer’d not, But with an angry wafture of your hand Gave sign for me to leave you. So I did, Fearing to strengthen that impatience Which seem’d too much enkindled; and withal Hoping it was but an effect of humour, Which sometime hath his hour with every man. It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep; And could it work so much upon your shape As it hath much prevail’d on your condition, I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord, Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.  BRUTUS. I am not well in health, and that is all.  PORTIA. Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health, He would embrace the means to come by it.  BRUTUS. Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.  PORTIA. Is Brutus sick, and is it physical To walk unbraced and suck up the humours Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick, And will he steal out of his wholesome bed To dare the vile contagion of the night, And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus; You have some sick offence within your mind, Which, by the right and virtue of my place, I ought to know of: and, upon my knees, I charm you, by my once commended beauty, By all your vows of love, and that great vow Which did incorporate and make us one, That you unfold to me, your self, your half, Why you are heavy, and what men tonight Have had resort to you; for here have been Some six or seven, who did hide their faces Even from darkness.  BRUTUS. Kneel not, gentle Portia.  PORTIA. I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus. Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus, Is it excepted I should know no secrets That appertain to you? Am I your self But, as it were, in sort or limitation, To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed, And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs Of your good pleasure? If it be no more, Portia is Brutus’ harlot, not his wife.  BRUTUS. You are my true and honourable wife, As dear to me as are the ruddy drops That visit my sad heart.  PORTIA. If this were true, then should I know this secret. I grant I am a woman; but withal A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife; I grant I am a woman; but withal A woman well reputed, Cato’s daughter. Think you I am no stronger than my sex, Being so father’d and so husbanded? Tell me your counsels, I will not disclose ’em. I have made strong proof of my constancy, Giving myself a voluntary wound Here, in the thigh: can I bear that with patience And not my husband’s secrets?  BRUTUS. O ye gods, Render me worthy of this noble wife!  [_Knock._]  Hark, hark, one knocks. Portia, go in awhile; And by and by thy bosom shall partake The secrets of my heart. All my engagements I will construe to thee, All the charactery of my sad brows. Leave me with haste.  [_Exit Portia._]  Enter Lucius with Ligarius.  Lucius, who’s that knocks?  LUCIUS. Here is a sick man that would speak with you.  BRUTUS. Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of. Boy, stand aside. Caius Ligarius, how?  LIGARIUS. Vouchsafe good-morrow from a feeble tongue.  BRUTUS. O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius, To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!  LIGARIUS. I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand Any exploit worthy the name of honour.  BRUTUS. Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius, Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.  LIGARIUS. By all the gods that Romans bow before, I here discard my sickness. Soul of Rome! Brave son, derived from honourable loins! Thou, like an exorcist, hast conjur’d up My mortified spirit. Now bid me run, And I will strive with things impossible, Yea, get the better of them. What’s to do?  BRUTUS. A piece of work that will make sick men whole.  LIGARIUS. But are not some whole that we must make sick?  BRUTUS. That must we also. What it is, my Caius, I shall unfold to thee, as we are going, To whom it must be done.  LIGARIUS. Set on your foot, And with a heart new-fir’d I follow you, To do I know not what; but it sufficeth That Brutus leads me on.  [_Thunder._]  BRUTUS. Follow me then.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. A room in Caesar’s palace.  Thunder and lightning. Enter Caesar, in his nightgown.  CAESAR. Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight: Thrice hath Calphurnia in her sleep cried out, “Help, ho! They murder Caesar!” Who’s within?  Enter a Servant.  SERVANT. My lord?  CAESAR. Go bid the priests do present sacrifice, And bring me their opinions of success.  SERVANT. I will, my lord.  [_Exit._]  Enter Calphurnia.  CALPHURNIA. What mean you, Caesar? Think you to walk forth? You shall not stir out of your house today.  CAESAR. Caesar shall forth. The things that threaten’d me Ne’er look’d but on my back; when they shall see The face of Caesar, they are vanished.  CALPHURNIA. Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies, Yet now they fright me. There is one within, Besides the things that we have heard and seen, Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch. A lioness hath whelped in the streets, And graves have yawn’d, and yielded up their dead; Fierce fiery warriors fight upon the clouds In ranks and squadrons and right form of war, Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol; The noise of battle hurtled in the air, Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan, And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets. O Caesar, these things are beyond all use, And I do fear them!  CAESAR. What can be avoided Whose end is purpos’d by the mighty gods? Yet Caesar shall go forth; for these predictions Are to the world in general as to Caesar.  CALPHURNIA. When beggars die, there are no comets seen; The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.  CAESAR. Cowards die many times before their deaths; The valiant never taste of death but once. Of all the wonders that I yet have heard, It seems to me most strange that men should fear, Seeing that death, a necessary end, Will come when it will come.  Enter Servant.  What say the augurers?  SERVANT. They would not have you to stir forth today. Plucking the entrails of an offering forth, They could not find a heart within the beast.  CAESAR. The gods do this in shame of cowardice: Caesar should be a beast without a heart If he should stay at home today for fear. No, Caesar shall not. Danger knows full well That Caesar is more dangerous than he. We are two lions litter’d in one day, And I the elder and more terrible, And Caesar shall go forth.  CALPHURNIA. Alas, my lord, Your wisdom is consum’d in confidence. Do not go forth today: call it my fear That keeps you in the house, and not your own. We’ll send Mark Antony to the Senate-house, And he shall say you are not well today. Let me upon my knee prevail in this.  CAESAR. Mark Antony shall say I am not well, And for thy humour, I will stay at home.  Enter Decius.  Here’s Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so.  DECIUS. Caesar, all hail! Good morrow, worthy Caesar. I come to fetch you to the Senate-house.  CAESAR. And you are come in very happy time To bear my greeting to the Senators, And tell them that I will not come today. Cannot, is false; and that I dare not, falser: I will not come today. Tell them so, Decius.  CALPHURNIA. Say he is sick.  CAESAR. Shall Caesar send a lie? Have I in conquest stretch’d mine arm so far, To be afeard to tell grey-beards the truth? Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.  DECIUS. Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause, Lest I be laugh’d at when I tell them so.  CAESAR. The cause is in my will; I will not come. That is enough to satisfy the Senate. But for your private satisfaction, Because I love you, I will let you know: Calphurnia here, my wife, stays me at home. She dreamt tonight she saw my statue, Which like a fountain with an hundred spouts Did run pure blood; and many lusty Romans Came smiling, and did bathe their hands in it. And these does she apply for warnings and portents And evils imminent; and on her knee Hath begg’d that I will stay at home today.  DECIUS. This dream is all amiss interpreted: It was a vision fair and fortunate. Your statue spouting blood in many pipes, In which so many smiling Romans bath’d, Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck Reviving blood, and that great men shall press For tinctures, stains, relics, and cognizance. This by Calphurnia’s dream is signified.  CAESAR. And this way have you well expounded it.  DECIUS. I have, when you have heard what I can say; And know it now. The Senate have concluded To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar. If you shall send them word you will not come, Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock Apt to be render’d, for someone to say, “Break up the Senate till another time, When Caesar’s wife shall meet with better dreams.” If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper “Lo, Caesar is afraid”? Pardon me, Caesar; for my dear dear love To your proceeding bids me tell you this, And reason to my love is liable.  CAESAR. How foolish do your fears seem now, Calphurnia! I am ashamed I did yield to them. Give me my robe, for I will go.  Enter Brutus, Ligarius, Metellus, Casca, Trebonius, Cinna and Publius.  And look where Publius is come to fetch me.  PUBLIUS. Good morrow, Caesar.  CAESAR. Welcome, Publius. What, Brutus, are you stirr’d so early too? Good morrow, Casca. Caius Ligarius, Caesar was ne’er so much your enemy As that same ague which hath made you lean. What is’t o’clock?  BRUTUS. Caesar, ’tis strucken eight.  CAESAR. I thank you for your pains and courtesy.  Enter Antony.  See! Antony, that revels long a-nights, Is notwithstanding up. Good morrow, Antony.  ANTONY. So to most noble Caesar.  CAESAR. Bid them prepare within. I am to blame to be thus waited for. Now, Cinna; now, Metellus; what, Trebonius! I have an hour’s talk in store for you: Remember that you call on me today; Be near me, that I may remember you.  TREBONIUS. Caesar, I will. [_Aside._] and so near will I be, That your best friends shall wish I had been further.  CAESAR. Good friends, go in, and taste some wine with me; And we, like friends, will straightway go together.  BRUTUS. [_Aside._] That every like is not the same, O Caesar, The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. A street near the Capitol.  Enter Artemidorus, reading a paper.  ARTEMIDORUS. _“Caesar, beware of Brutus; take heed of Cassius; come not near Casca; have an eye to Cinna; trust not Trebonius; mark well Metellus Cimber; Decius Brutus loves thee not; thou hast wrong’d Caius Ligarius. There is but one mind in all these men, and it is bent against Caesar. If thou be’st not immortal, look about you: security gives way to conspiracy. The mighty gods defend thee! Thy lover, Artemidorus.”_ Here will I stand till Caesar pass along, And as a suitor will I give him this. My heart laments that virtue cannot live Out of the teeth of emulation. If thou read this, O Caesar, thou mayest live; If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive.
[_Exit._]  SCENE IV. Another part of the same street, before the house of Brutus.  Enter Portia and Lucius.  PORTIA. I pr’ythee, boy, run to the Senate-house; Stay not to answer me, but get thee gone. Why dost thou stay?  LUCIUS. To know my errand, madam.  PORTIA. I would have had thee there and here again, Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there. [_Aside._] O constancy, be strong upon my side, Set a huge mountain ’tween my heart and tongue! I have a man’s mind, but a woman’s might. How hard it is for women to keep counsel! Art thou here yet?  LUCIUS. Madam, what should I do? Run to the Capitol, and nothing else? And so return to you, and nothing else?  PORTIA. Yes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look well, For he went sickly forth: and take good note What Caesar doth, what suitors press to him. Hark, boy, what noise is that?  LUCIUS. I hear none, madam.  PORTIA. Pr’ythee, listen well. I heard a bustling rumour, like a fray, And the wind brings it from the Capitol.  LUCIUS. Sooth, madam, I hear nothing.  Enter the Soothsayer.  PORTIA. Come hither, fellow: Which way hast thou been?  SOOTHSAYER. At mine own house, good lady.  PORTIA. What is’t o’clock?  SOOTHSAYER. About the ninth hour, lady.  PORTIA. Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?  SOOTHSAYER. Madam, not yet. I go to take my stand, To see him pass on to the Capitol.  PORTIA. Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not?  SOOTHSAYER. That I have, lady, if it will please Caesar To be so good to Caesar as to hear me, I shall beseech him to befriend himself.  PORTIA. Why, know’st thou any harm’s intended towards him?  SOOTHSAYER. None that I know will be, much that I fear may chance. Good morrow to you. Here the street is narrow. The throng that follows Caesar at the heels, Of Senators, of Praetors, common suitors, Will crowd a feeble man almost to death: I’ll get me to a place more void, and there Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.  [_Exit._]  PORTIA. I must go in. [_Aside._] Ay me, how weak a thing The heart of woman is! O Brutus, The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise! Sure, the boy heard me. Brutus hath a suit That Caesar will not grant. O, I grow faint. Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord; Say I am merry; come to me again, And bring me word what he doth say to thee.  [_Exeunt._]
  ACT III  SCENE I. Rome. Before the Capitol; the Senate sitting.
A crowd of people in the street leading to the Capitol. Flourish. Enter Caesar, Brutus, Cassius, Casca, Decius, Metellus, Trebonius, Cinna, Antony, Lepidus, Artemidorus, Publius, Popilius and the Soothsayer.  CAESAR. The Ides of March are come.  SOOTHSAYER. Ay, Caesar; but not gone.  ARTEMIDORUS. Hail, Caesar! Read this schedule.  DECIUS. Trebonius doth desire you to o’er-read, At your best leisure, this his humble suit.  ARTEMIDORUS. O Caesar, read mine first; for mine’s a suit That touches Caesar nearer. Read it, great Caesar.  CAESAR. What touches us ourself shall be last serv’d.  ARTEMIDORUS. Delay not, Caesar. Read it instantly.  CAESAR. What, is the fellow mad?  PUBLIUS. Sirrah, give place.  CASSIUS. What, urge you your petitions in the street? Come to the Capitol.  Caesar enters the Capitol, the rest following. All the Senators rise.  POPILIUS. I wish your enterprise today may thrive.  CASSIUS. What enterprise, Popilius?  POPILIUS. Fare you well.  [_Advances to Caesar._]  BRUTUS. What said Popilius Lena?  CASSIUS. He wish’d today our enterprise might thrive. I fear our purpose is discovered.  BRUTUS. Look how he makes to Caesar: mark him.  CASSIUS. Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention. Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known, Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back, For I will slay myself.  BRUTUS. Cassius, be constant: Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes; For look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change.  CASSIUS. Trebonius knows his time, for look you, Brutus, He draws Mark Antony out of the way.  [_Exeunt Antony and Trebonius. Caesar and the Senators take their seats._]  DECIUS. Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go, And presently prefer his suit to Caesar.  BRUTUS. He is address’d; press near and second him.  CINNA. Casca, you are the first that rears your hand.  CAESAR. Are we all ready? What is now amiss That Caesar and his Senate must redress?  METELLUS. Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar, Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat An humble heart.  [_Kneeling._]  CAESAR. I must prevent thee, Cimber. These couchings and these lowly courtesies Might fire the blood of ordinary men, And turn pre-ordinance and first decree Into the law of children. Be not fond, To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood That will be thaw’d from the true quality With that which melteth fools; I mean sweet words, Low-crooked curtsies, and base spaniel fawning. Thy brother by decree is banished: If thou dost bend, and pray, and fawn for him, I spurn thee like a cur out of my way. Know, Caesar dost not wrong, nor without cause Will he be satisfied.  METELLUS. Is there no voice more worthy than my own, To sound more sweetly in great Caesar’s ear For the repealing of my banish’d brother?  BRUTUS. I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar; Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may Have an immediate freedom of repeal.  CAESAR. What, Brutus?  CASSIUS. Pardon, Caesar; Caesar, pardon: As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall, To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.  CAESAR. I could be well mov’d, if I were as you; If I could pray to move, prayers would move me: But I am constant as the northern star, Of whose true-fix’d and resting quality There is no fellow in the firmament. The skies are painted with unnumber’d sparks, They are all fire, and every one doth shine; But there’s but one in all doth hold his place. So in the world; ’tis furnish’d well with men, And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive; Yet in the number I do know but one That unassailable holds on his rank, Unshak’d of motion: and that I am he, Let me a little show it, even in this, That I was constant Cimber should be banish’d, And constant do remain to keep him so.  CINNA. O Caesar,—  CAESAR. Hence! wilt thou lift up Olympus?  DECIUS. Great Caesar,—  CAESAR. Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?  CASCA. Speak, hands, for me!  [_Casca stabs Caesar in the neck. Caesar catches hold of his arm. He is then stabbed by several other Conspirators, and at last by Marcus Brutus._]  CAESAR. _Et tu, Brute?_—Then fall, Caesar!  [_Dies. The Senators and People retire in confusion._]  CINNA. Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead! Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.  CASSIUS. Some to the common pulpits and cry out, “Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement!”  BRUTUS. People and Senators, be not affrighted. Fly not; stand still; ambition’s debt is paid.  CASCA. Go to the pulpit, Brutus.  DECIUS. And Cassius too.  BRUTUS. Where’s Publius?  CINNA. Here, quite confounded with this mutiny.  METELLUS. Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar’s Should chance—  BRUTUS. Talk not of standing. Publius, good cheer! There is no harm intended to your person, Nor to no Roman else. So tell them, Publius.  CASSIUS. And leave us, Publius; lest that the people Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief.  BRUTUS. Do so; and let no man abide this deed But we the doers.  Enter Trebonius.  CASSIUS. Where’s Antony?  TREBONIUS. Fled to his house amaz’d. Men, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run, As it were doomsday.  BRUTUS. Fates, we will know your pleasures. That we shall die, we know; ’tis but the time And drawing days out, that men stand upon.  CASCA. Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life Cuts off so many years of fearing death.  BRUTUS. Grant that, and then is death a benefit: So are we Caesar’s friends, that have abridg’d His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop, And let us bathe our hands in Caesar’s blood Up to the elbows, and besmear our swords: Then walk we forth, even to the market-place, And waving our red weapons o’er our heads, Let’s all cry, “Peace, freedom, and liberty!”  CASSIUS. Stoop then, and wash. How many ages hence Shall this our lofty scene be acted over In States unborn, and accents yet unknown!  BRUTUS. How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport, That now on Pompey’s basis lies along, No worthier than the dust!  CASSIUS. So oft as that shall be, So often shall the knot of us be call’d The men that gave their country liberty.  DECIUS. What, shall we forth?  CASSIUS. Ay, every man away. Brutus shall lead; and we will grace his heels With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.  Enter a Servant.  BRUTUS. Soft, who comes here? A friend of Antony’s.  SERVANT. Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel; Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down; And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say: Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest; Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving; Say I love Brutus and I honour him; Say I fear’d Caesar, honour’d him, and lov’d him. If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony May safely come to him, and be resolv’d How Caesar hath deserv’d to lie in death, Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead So well as Brutus living; but will follow The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus Thorough the hazards of this untrod state, With all true faith. So says my master Antony.  BRUTUS. Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman; I never thought him worse. Tell him, so please him come unto this place, He shall be satisfied and, by my honour, Depart untouch’d.  SERVANT. I’ll fetch him presently.  [_Exit._]  BRUTUS. I know that we shall have him well to friend.  CASSIUS. I wish we may: but yet have I a mind That fears him much; and my misgiving still Falls shrewdly to the purpose.  Enter Antony.  BRUTUS. But here comes Antony. Welcome, Mark Antony.  ANTONY. O mighty Caesar! Dost thou lie so low? Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils, Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well. I know not, gentlemen, what you intend, Who else must be let blood, who else is rank: If I myself, there is no hour so fit As Caesar’s death’s hour; nor no instrument Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich With the most noble blood of all this world. I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard, Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke, Fulfill your pleasure. Live a thousand years, I shall not find myself so apt to die. No place will please me so, no means of death, As here by Caesar, and by you cut off, The choice and master spirits of this age.  BRUTUS. O Antony, beg not your death of us. Though now we must appear bloody and cruel, As by our hands and this our present act You see we do; yet see you but our hands And this the bleeding business they have done. Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful; And pity to the general wrong of Rome— As fire drives out fire, so pity pity— Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part, To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony; Our arms in strength of malice, and our hearts Of brothers’ temper, do receive you in With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.  CASSIUS. Your voice shall be as strong as any man’s In the disposing of new dignities.  BRUTUS. Only be patient till we have appeas’d The multitude, beside themselves with fear, And then we will deliver you the cause Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him, Have thus proceeded.  ANTONY. I doubt not of your wisdom. Let each man render me his bloody hand. First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you; Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand. Now, Decius Brutus, yours; now yours, Metellus; Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours; Though last, not least in love, yours, good Trebonius. Gentlemen all—alas, what shall I say? My credit now stands on such slippery ground, That one of two bad ways you must conceit me, Either a coward or a flatterer. That I did love thee, Caesar, O, ’tis true: If then thy spirit look upon us now, Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death, To see thy Antony making his peace, Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes, Most noble, in the presence of thy corse? Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds, Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood, It would become me better than to close In terms of friendship with thine enemies. Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay’d, brave hart; Here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand, Sign’d in thy spoil, and crimson’d in thy lethe. O world, thou wast the forest to this hart; And this indeed, O world, the heart of thee. How like a deer strucken by many princes, Dost thou here lie!  CASSIUS. Mark Antony,—  ANTONY. Pardon me, Caius Cassius: The enemies of Caesar shall say this; Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.  CASSIUS. I blame you not for praising Caesar so; But what compact mean you to have with us? Will you be prick’d in number of our friends, Or shall we on, and not depend on you?  ANTONY. Therefore I took your hands; but was indeed Sway’d from the point, by looking down on Caesar. Friends am I with you all, and love you all, Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons Why, and wherein, Caesar was dangerous.  BRUTUS. Or else were this a savage spectacle. Our reasons are so full of good regard That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar, You should be satisfied.  ANTONY. That’s all I seek, And am moreover suitor that I may Produce his body to the market-place; And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend, Speak in the order of his funeral.  BRUTUS. You shall, Mark Antony.  CASSIUS. Brutus, a word with you. [_Aside to Brutus._] You know not what you do. Do not consent That Antony speak in his funeral. Know you how much the people may be mov’d By that which he will utter?  BRUTUS. [_Aside to Cassius._] By your pardon: I will myself into the pulpit first, And show the reason of our Caesar’s death. What Antony shall speak, I will protest He speaks by leave and by permission; And that we are contented Caesar shall Have all true rights and lawful ceremonies. It shall advantage more than do us wrong.  CASSIUS. [_Aside to Brutus._] I know not what may fall; I like it not.  BRUTUS. Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar’s body. You shall not in your funeral speech blame us, But speak all good you can devise of Caesar, And say you do’t by our permission; Else shall you not have any hand at all About his funeral. And you shall speak In the same pulpit whereto I am going, After my speech is ended.  ANTONY. Be it so; I do desire no more.  BRUTUS. Prepare the body, then, and follow us.  [_Exeunt all but Antony._]  ANTONY. O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth, That I am meek and gentle with these butchers. Thou art the ruins of the noblest man That ever lived in the tide of times. Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood! Over thy wounds now do I prophesy, Which, like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue, A curse shall light upon the limbs of men; Domestic fury and fierce civil strife Shall cumber all the parts of Italy; Blood and destruction shall be so in use, And dreadful objects so familiar, That mothers shall but smile when they behold Their infants quartered with the hands of war; All pity chok’d with custom of fell deeds: And Caesar’s spirit, ranging for revenge, With Ate by his side come hot from Hell, Shall in these confines with a monarch’s voice Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war, That this foul deed shall smell above the earth With carrion men, groaning for burial.  Enter a Servant.  You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?  SERVANT. I do, Mark Antony.  ANTONY. Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.  SERVANT. He did receive his letters, and is coming, And bid me say to you by word of mouth,— [_Seeing the body._] O Caesar!  ANTONY. Thy heart is big, get thee apart and weep. Passion, I see, is catching; for mine eyes, Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine, Began to water. Is thy master coming?  SERVANT. He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome.  ANTONY. Post back with speed, and tell him what hath chanc’d. Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome, No Rome of safety for Octavius yet. Hie hence, and tell him so. Yet stay awhile; Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse Into the market-place: there shall I try, In my oration, how the people take The cruel issue of these bloody men; According to the which thou shalt discourse To young Octavius of the state of things. Lend me your hand.  [_Exeunt with Caesar’s body._]  SCENE II. The same. The Forum.  Enter Brutus and goes into the pulpit, and Cassius, with a throng of Citizens.  CITIZENS. We will be satisfied; let us be satisfied.  BRUTUS. Then follow me, and give me audience, friends. Cassius, go you into the other street And part the numbers. Those that will hear me speak, let ’em stay here; Those that will follow Cassius, go with him; And public reasons shall be rendered Of Caesar’s death.  FIRST CITIZEN. I will hear Brutus speak.  SECOND CITIZEN. I will hear Cassius; and compare their reasons, When severally we hear them rendered.  [_Exit Cassius, with some of the Citizens. Brutus goes into the rostrum._]  THIRD CITIZEN. The noble Brutus is ascended: silence!  BRUTUS. Be patient till the last. Romans, countrymen, and lovers, hear me for my cause; and be silent, that you may hear. Believe me for mine honour, and have respect to mine honour, that you may believe. Censure me in your wisdom, and awake your senses, that you may the better judge. If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar’s, to him I say that Brutus’ love to Caesar was no less than his. If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer: Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living, and die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live all free men? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him; as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was valiant, I honour him; but, as he was ambitious, I slew him. There is tears, for his love; joy for his fortune; honour for his valour; and death, for his ambition. Who is here so base, that would be a bondman? If any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so rude, that would not be a Roman? If any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so vile, that will not love his country? If any, speak; for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.  CITIZENS. None, Brutus, none.  BRUTUS. Then none have I offended. I have done no more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of his death is enroll’d in the Capitol, his glory not extenuated, wherein he was worthy; nor his offences enforc’d, for which he suffered death.  Enter Antony and others, with Caesar’s body.  Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony, who, though he had no hand in his death, shall receive the benefit of his dying, a place in the commonwealth; as which of you shall not? With this I depart, that, as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself, when it shall please my country to need my death.  CITIZENS. Live, Brutus! live, live!  FIRST CITIZEN. Bring him with triumph home unto his house.  SECOND CITIZEN. Give him a statue with his ancestors.  THIRD CITIZEN. Let him be Caesar.  FOURTH CITIZEN. Caesar’s better parts Shall be crown’d in Brutus.  FIRST CITIZEN. We’ll bring him to his house with shouts and clamours.  BRUTUS. My countrymen,—  SECOND CITIZEN. Peace! Silence! Brutus speaks.  FIRST CITIZEN. Peace, ho!  BRUTUS. Good countrymen, let me depart alone, And, for my sake, stay here with Antony. Do grace to Caesar’s corpse, and grace his speech Tending to Caesar’s glories, which Mark Antony, By our permission, is allow’d to make. I do entreat you, not a man depart, Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.  [_Exit._]  FIRST CITIZEN. Stay, ho! and let us hear Mark Antony.  THIRD CITIZEN. Let him go up into the public chair. We’ll hear him. Noble Antony, go up.  ANTONY. For Brutus’ sake, I am beholding to you.  [_Goes up._]  FOURTH CITIZEN. What does he say of Brutus?  THIRD CITIZEN. He says, for Brutus’ sake He finds himself beholding to us all.  FOURTH CITIZEN. ’Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here!  FIRST CITIZEN. This Caesar was a tyrant.  THIRD CITIZEN. Nay, that’s certain. We are blest that Rome is rid of him.  SECOND CITIZEN. Peace! let us hear what Antony can say.  ANTONY. You gentle Romans,—  CITIZENS. Peace, ho! let us hear him.  ANTONY. Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears; I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him. The evil that men do lives after them, The good is oft interred with their bones; So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus Hath told you Caesar was ambitious. If it were so, it was a grievous fault, And grievously hath Caesar answer’d it. Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest, For Brutus is an honourable man, So are they all, all honourable men, Come I to speak in Caesar’s funeral. He was my friend, faithful and just to me; But Brutus says he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honourable man. He hath brought many captives home to Rome, Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: Did this in Caesar seem ambitious? When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept; Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; And Brutus is an honourable man. You all did see that on the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown, Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; And sure he is an honourable man. I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, But here I am to speak what I do know. You all did love him once, not without cause; What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? O judgement, thou art fled to brutish beasts, And men have lost their reason. Bear with me. My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar, And I must pause till it come back to me.  FIRST CITIZEN. Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.  SECOND CITIZEN. If thou consider rightly of the matter, Caesar has had great wrong.  THIRD CITIZEN. Has he, masters? I fear there will a worse come in his place.  FOURTH CITIZEN. Mark’d ye his words? He would not take the crown; Therefore ’tis certain he was not ambitious.  FIRST CITIZEN. If it be found so, some will dear abide it.  SECOND CITIZEN. Poor soul, his eyes are red as fire with weeping.  THIRD CITIZEN. There’s not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.  FOURTH CITIZEN. Now mark him; he begins again to speak.  ANTONY. But yesterday the word of Caesar might Have stood against the world; now lies he there, And none so poor to do him reverence. O masters! If I were dispos’d to stir Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage, I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong, Who, you all know, are honourable men. I will not do them wrong; I rather choose To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you, Than I will wrong such honourable men. But here’s a parchment with the seal of Caesar, I found it in his closet; ’tis his will: Let but the commons hear this testament, Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read, And they would go and kiss dead Caesar’s wounds, And dip their napkins in his sacred blood; Yea, beg a hair of him for memory, And, dying, mention it within their wills, Bequeathing it as a rich legacy Unto their issue.  FOURTH CITIZEN. We’ll hear the will. Read it, Mark Antony.  CITIZENS. The will, the will! We will hear Caesar’s will.  ANTONY. Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it. It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you. You are not wood, you are not stones, but men; And being men, hearing the will of Caesar, It will inflame you, it will make you mad. ’Tis good you know not that you are his heirs; For if you should, O, what would come of it?  FOURTH CITIZEN. Read the will! We’ll hear it, Antony; You shall read us the will, Caesar’s will!  ANTONY. Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile? I have o’ershot myself to tell you of it. I fear I wrong the honourable men Whose daggers have stabb’d Caesar; I do fear it.  FOURTH CITIZEN. They were traitors. Honourable men!  CITIZENS. The will! The testament!  SECOND CITIZEN. They were villains, murderers. The will! Read the will!  ANTONY. You will compel me then to read the will? Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar, And let me show you him that made the will. Shall I descend? and will you give me leave?  CITIZENS. Come down.  SECOND CITIZEN. Descend.  [_He comes down._]  THIRD CITIZEN. You shall have leave.  FOURTH CITIZEN. A ring! Stand round.  FIRST CITIZEN. Stand from the hearse, stand from the body.  SECOND CITIZEN. Room for Antony, most noble Antony!  ANTONY. Nay, press not so upon me; stand far off.  CITIZENS. Stand back; room! bear back.  ANTONY. If you have tears, prepare to shed them now. You all do know this mantle. I remember The first time ever Caesar put it on; ’Twas on a Summer’s evening, in his tent, That day he overcame the Nervii. Look, in this place ran Cassius’ dagger through: See what a rent the envious Casca made: Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb’d; And as he pluck’d his cursed steel away, Mark how the blood of Caesar follow’d it, As rushing out of doors, to be resolv’d If Brutus so unkindly knock’d, or no; For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar’s angel. Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar lov’d him. This was the most unkindest cut of all; For when the noble Caesar saw him stab, Ingratitude, more strong than traitors’ arms, Quite vanquish’d him: then burst his mighty heart; And in his mantle muffling up his face, Even at the base of Pompey’s statue Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell. O, what a fall was there, my countrymen! Then I, and you, and all of us fell down, Whilst bloody treason flourish’d over us. O, now you weep; and I perceive you feel The dint of pity. These are gracious drops. Kind souls, what weep you when you but behold Our Caesar’s vesture wounded? Look you here, Here is himself, marr’d, as you see, with traitors.  FIRST CITIZEN. O piteous spectacle!  SECOND CITIZEN. O noble Caesar!  THIRD CITIZEN. O woeful day!  FOURTH CITIZEN. O traitors, villains!  FIRST CITIZEN. O most bloody sight!  SECOND CITIZEN. We will be revenged.  CITIZENS. Revenge,—about,—seek,—burn,—fire,—kill,—slay,—let not a traitor live!  ANTONY. Stay, countrymen.  FIRST CITIZEN. Peace there! Hear the noble Antony.  SECOND CITIZEN. We’ll hear him, we’ll follow him, we’ll die with him.  ANTONY. Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up To such a sudden flood of mutiny. They that have done this deed are honourable. What private griefs they have, alas, I know not, That made them do it. They’re wise and honourable, And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you. I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts. I am no orator, as Brutus is; But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man, That love my friend; and that they know full well That gave me public leave to speak of him. For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth, Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech, To stir men’s blood. I only speak right on. I tell you that which you yourselves do know, Show you sweet Caesar’s wounds, poor poor dumb mouths, And bid them speak for me. But were I Brutus, And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony Would ruffle up your spirits, and put a tongue In every wound of Caesar, that should move The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.  CITIZENS. We’ll mutiny.  FIRST CITIZEN. We’ll burn the house of Brutus.  THIRD CITIZEN. Away, then! come, seek the conspirators.  ANTONY. Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.  CITIZENS. Peace, ho! Hear Antony; most noble Antony.  ANTONY. Why, friends, you go to do you know not what. Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves? Alas, you know not; I must tell you then. You have forgot the will I told you of.  CITIZENS. Most true; the will!—let’s stay, and hear the will.  ANTONY. Here is the will, and under Caesar’s seal. To every Roman citizen he gives, To every several man, seventy-five drachmas.  SECOND CITIZEN. Most noble Caesar! We’ll revenge his death.  THIRD CITIZEN. O, royal Caesar!  ANTONY. Hear me with patience.  CITIZENS. Peace, ho!  ANTONY. Moreover, he hath left you all his walks, His private arbors, and new-planted orchards, On this side Tiber; he hath left them you, And to your heirs forever; common pleasures, To walk abroad, and recreate yourselves. Here was a Caesar! when comes such another?  FIRST CITIZEN. Never, never. Come, away, away! We’ll burn his body in the holy place, And with the brands fire the traitors’ houses. Take up the body.  SECOND CITIZEN. Go, fetch fire.  THIRD CITIZEN. Pluck down benches.  FOURTH CITIZEN. Pluck down forms, windows, anything.  [_Exeunt Citizens, with the body._]  ANTONY. Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot, Take thou what course thou wilt!  Enter a Servant.  How now, fellow?  SERVANT. Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome.  ANTONY. Where is he?  SERVANT. He and Lepidus are at Caesar’s house.  ANTONY. And thither will I straight to visit him. He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry, And in this mood will give us anything.  SERVANT. I heard him say Brutus and Cassius Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome.  ANTONY. Belike they had some notice of the people, How I had moved them. Bring me to Octavius.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. The same. A street.  Enter Cinna, the poet, and after him the citizens.  CINNA. I dreamt tonight that I did feast with Caesar, And things unluckily charge my fantasy. I have no will to wander forth of doors, Yet something leads me forth.  FIRST CITIZEN. What is your name?  SECOND CITIZEN. Whither are you going?  THIRD CITIZEN. Where do you dwell?  FOURTH CITIZEN. Are you a married man or a bachelor?  SECOND CITIZEN. Answer every man directly.  FIRST CITIZEN. Ay, and briefly.  FOURTH CITIZEN. Ay, and wisely.  THIRD CITIZEN. Ay, and truly, you were best.  CINNA. What is my name? Whither am I going? Where do I dwell? Am I a married man or a bachelor? Then, to answer every man directly and briefly, wisely and truly. Wisely I say I am a bachelor.  SECOND CITIZEN. That’s as much as to say they are fools that marry; you’ll bear me a bang for that, I fear. Proceed, directly.  CINNA. Directly, I am going to Caesar’s funeral.  FIRST CITIZEN. As a friend, or an enemy?  CINNA. As a friend.  SECOND CITIZEN. That matter is answered directly.  FOURTH CITIZEN. For your dwelling, briefly.  CINNA. Briefly, I dwell by the Capitol.  THIRD CITIZEN. Your name, sir, truly.  CINNA. Truly, my name is Cinna.  FIRST CITIZEN. Tear him to pieces! He’s a conspirator.  CINNA. I am Cinna the poet, I am Cinna the poet.  FOURTH CITIZEN. Tear him for his bad verses, tear him for his bad verses.  CINNA. I am not Cinna the conspirator.  FOURTH CITIZEN. It is no matter, his name’s Cinna; pluck but his name out of his heart, and turn him going.  THIRD CITIZEN. Tear him, tear him! Come; brands, ho! firebrands. To Brutus’, to Cassius’; burn all. Some to Decius’ house, and some to Casca’s, some to Ligarius’. Away, go!  [_Exeunt._]
  ACT IV  SCENE I. Rome. A room in Antony’s house.
  ACT V  SCENE I. The plains of Philippi.
Enter Octavius, Antony and their Army.  OCTAVIUS. Now, Antony, our hopes are answered. You said the enemy would not come down, But keep the hills and upper regions. It proves not so; their battles are at hand, They mean to warn us at Philippi here, Answering before we do demand of them.  ANTONY. Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know Wherefore they do it. They could be content To visit other places, and come down With fearful bravery, thinking by this face To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage; But ’tis not so.  Enter a Messenger.  MESSENGER. Prepare you, generals. The enemy comes on in gallant show; Their bloody sign of battle is hung out, And something to be done immediately.  ANTONY. Octavius, lead your battle softly on Upon the left hand of the even field.  OCTAVIUS. Upon the right hand I. Keep thou the left.  ANTONY. Why do you cross me in this exigent?  OCTAVIUS. I do not cross you; but I will do so.  [_March._]  Drum. Enter Brutus, Cassius and their Army; Lucilius, Titinius, Messala and others.  BRUTUS. They stand, and would have parley.  CASSIUS. Stand fast, Titinius; we must out and talk.  OCTAVIUS. Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?  ANTONY. No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge. Make forth; the generals would have some words.  OCTAVIUS. Stir not until the signal.  BRUTUS. Words before blows: is it so, countrymen?  OCTAVIUS. Not that we love words better, as you do.  BRUTUS. Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.  ANTONY. In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words; Witness the hole you made in Caesar’s heart, Crying, “Long live! Hail, Caesar!”  CASSIUS. Antony, The posture of your blows are yet unknown; But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees, And leave them honeyless.  ANTONY. Not stingless too.  BRUTUS. O yes, and soundless too, For you have stol’n their buzzing, Antony, And very wisely threat before you sting.  ANTONY. Villains, you did not so when your vile daggers Hack’d one another in the sides of Caesar: You show’d your teeth like apes, and fawn’d like hounds, And bow’d like bondmen, kissing Caesar’s feet; Whilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind Struck Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers!  CASSIUS. Flatterers! Now, Brutus, thank yourself. This tongue had not offended so today, If Cassius might have rul’d.  OCTAVIUS. Come, come, the cause. If arguing makes us sweat, The proof of it will turn to redder drops. Look, I draw a sword against conspirators. When think you that the sword goes up again? Never, till Caesar’s three and thirty wounds Be well aveng’d; or till another Caesar Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.  BRUTUS. Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors’ hands, Unless thou bring’st them with thee.  OCTAVIUS. So I hope. I was not born to die on Brutus’ sword.  BRUTUS. O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain, Young man, thou couldst not die more honourable.  CASSIUS. A peevish school-boy, worthless of such honour, Join’d with a masker and a reveller.  ANTONY. Old Cassius still!  OCTAVIUS. Come, Antony; away! Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth. If you dare fight today, come to the field; If not, when you have stomachs.  [_Exeunt Octavius, Antony and their Army._]  CASSIUS. Why now, blow wind, swell billow, and swim bark! The storm is up, and all is on the hazard.  BRUTUS. Ho, Lucilius! Hark, a word with you.  LUCILIUS. My lord?  [_Brutus and Lucilius talk apart._]  CASSIUS. Messala.  MESSALA. What says my General?  CASSIUS. Messala, This is my birth-day; as this very day Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala: Be thou my witness that against my will As Pompey was, am I compell’d to set Upon one battle all our liberties. You know that I held Epicurus strong, And his opinion. Now I change my mind, And partly credit things that do presage. Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch’d, Gorging and feeding from our soldiers’ hands, Who to Philippi here consorted us. This morning are they fled away and gone, And in their steads do ravens, crows, and kites Fly o’er our heads, and downward look on us, As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem A canopy most fatal, under which Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.  MESSALA. Believe not so.  CASSIUS. I but believe it partly, For I am fresh of spirit, and resolv’d To meet all perils very constantly.  BRUTUS. Even so, Lucilius.  CASSIUS. Now, most noble Brutus, The gods today stand friendly, that we may, Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age! But, since the affairs of men rest still incertain, Let’s reason with the worst that may befall. If we do lose this battle, then is this The very last time we shall speak together: What are you then determined to do?  BRUTUS. Even by the rule of that philosophy By which I did blame Cato for the death Which he did give himself, I know not how, But I do find it cowardly and vile, For fear of what might fall, so to prevent The time of life, arming myself with patience To stay the providence of some high powers That govern us below.  CASSIUS. Then, if we lose this battle, You are contented to be led in triumph Thorough the streets of Rome?  BRUTUS. No, Cassius, no: think not, thou noble Roman, That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome; He bears too great a mind. But this same day Must end that work the Ides of March begun; And whether we shall meet again I know not. Therefore our everlasting farewell take. For ever, and for ever, farewell, Cassius. If we do meet again, why, we shall smile; If not, why then this parting was well made.  CASSIUS. For ever and for ever farewell, Brutus. If we do meet again, we’ll smile indeed; If not, ’tis true this parting was well made.  BRUTUS. Why then, lead on. O, that a man might know The end of this day’s business ere it come! But it sufficeth that the day will end, And then the end is known. Come, ho! away!  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. The same. The field of battle.  Alarum. Enter Brutus and Messala.  BRUTUS. Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills Unto the legions on the other side.  [_Loud alarum._]  Let them set on at once; for I perceive But cold demeanor in Octavius’ wing, And sudden push gives them the overthrow. Ride, ride, Messala; let them all come down.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. Another part of the field.  Alarum. Enter Cassius and Titinius.  CASSIUS. O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly! Myself have to mine own turn’d enemy: This ensign here of mine was turning back; I slew the coward, and did take it from him.  TITINIUS. O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early, Who, having some advantage on Octavius, Took it too eagerly: his soldiers fell to spoil, Whilst we by Antony are all enclos’d.  Enter Pindarus.  PINDARUS. Fly further off, my lord, fly further off; Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord. Fly, therefore, noble Cassius, fly far off.  CASSIUS. This hill is far enough. Look, look, Titinius; Are those my tents where I perceive the fire?  TITINIUS. They are, my lord.  CASSIUS. Titinius, if thou lovest me, Mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him, Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops And here again, that I may rest assur’d Whether yond troops are friend or enemy.  TITINIUS. I will be here again, even with a thought.  [_Exit._]  CASSIUS. Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill, My sight was ever thick. Regard Titinius, And tell me what thou notest about the field.  [_Pindarus goes up._]  This day I breathed first. Time is come round, And where I did begin, there shall I end. My life is run his compass. Sirrah, what news?  PINDARUS. [_Above._] O my lord!  CASSIUS. What news?  PINDARUS. [_Above._] Titinius is enclosed round about With horsemen, that make to him on the spur, Yet he spurs on. Now they are almost on him. Now, Titinius! Now some light. O, he lights too. He’s ta’en!  [_Shout._]  And, hark! they shout for joy.  CASSIUS. Come down; behold no more. O, coward that I am, to live so long, To see my best friend ta’en before my face!  [_Pindarus descends._]  Come hither, sirrah. In Parthia did I take thee prisoner; And then I swore thee, saving of thy life, That whatsoever I did bid thee do, Thou shouldst attempt it. Come now, keep thine oath. Now be a freeman; and with this good sword, That ran through Caesar’s bowels, search this bosom. Stand not to answer. Here, take thou the hilts; And when my face is cover’d, as ’tis now, Guide thou the sword.—Caesar, thou art reveng’d, Even with the sword that kill’d thee.  [_Dies._]  PINDARUS. So, I am free, yet would not so have been, Durst I have done my will. O Cassius! Far from this country Pindarus shall run, Where never Roman shall take note of him.  [_Exit._]  Enter Titinius with Messala.  MESSALA. It is but change, Titinius; for Octavius Is overthrown by noble Brutus’ power, As Cassius’ legions are by Antony.  TITINIUS. These tidings would well comfort Cassius.  MESSALA. Where did you leave him?  TITINIUS. All disconsolate, With Pindarus his bondman, on this hill.  MESSALA. Is not that he that lies upon the ground?  TITINIUS. He lies not like the living. O my heart!  MESSALA. Is not that he?  TITINIUS. No, this was he, Messala, But Cassius is no more. O setting sun, As in thy red rays thou dost sink to night, So in his red blood Cassius’ day is set. The sun of Rome is set. Our day is gone; Clouds, dews, and dangers come; our deeds are done. Mistrust of my success hath done this deed.  MESSALA. Mistrust of good success hath done this deed. O hateful Error, Melancholy’s child! Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men The things that are not? O Error, soon conceiv’d, Thou never com’st unto a happy birth, But kill’st the mother that engender’d thee!  TITINIUS. What, Pindarus! where art thou, Pindarus?  MESSALA. Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet The noble Brutus, thrusting this report Into his ears. I may say thrusting it; For piercing steel and darts envenomed Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus As tidings of this sight.  TITINIUS. Hie you, Messala, And I will seek for Pindarus the while.  [_Exit Messala._]  Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius? Did I not meet thy friends? And did not they Put on my brows this wreath of victory, And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts? Alas, thou hast misconstrued everything! But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow; Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I Will do his bidding. Brutus, come apace, And see how I regarded Caius Cassius. By your leave, gods. This is a Roman’s part. Come, Cassius’ sword, and find Titinius’ heart.  [_Dies._]  Alarum. Enter Brutus, Messala, young Cato, Strato, Volumnius and Lucilius.  BRUTUS. Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?  MESSALA. Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.  BRUTUS. Titinius’ face is upward.  CATO. He is slain.  BRUTUS. O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet! Thy spirit walks abroad, and turns our swords In our own proper entrails.  [_Low alarums._]  CATO. Brave Titinius! Look whether he have not crown’d dead Cassius!  BRUTUS. Are yet two Romans living such as these? The last of all the Romans, fare thee well! It is impossible that ever Rome Should breed thy fellow. Friends, I owe more tears To this dead man than you shall see me pay. I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time. Come therefore, and to Thassos send his body. His funerals shall not be in our camp, Lest it discomfort us. Lucilius, come; And come, young Cato; let us to the field. Labeo and Flavius, set our battles on. ’Tis three o’clock; and Romans, yet ere night We shall try fortune in a second fight.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IV. Another part of the field.  Alarum. Enter fighting soldiers of both armies; then Brutus, Messala, young Cato, Lucilius, Flavius and others.  BRUTUS. Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!  CATO. What bastard doth not? Who will go with me? I will proclaim my name about the field. I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho! A foe to tyrants, and my country’s friend. I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!  [_Charges the enemy._]  LUCILIUS. And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I; Brutus, my country’s friend; know me for Brutus!  [_Exit, charging the enemy. Cato is overpowered, and falls._]  LUCILIUS. O young and noble Cato, art thou down? Why, now thou diest as bravely as Titinius, And mayst be honour’d, being Cato’s son.  FIRST SOLDIER. Yield, or thou diest.  LUCILIUS. Only I yield to die: There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight;  [_Offering money_]  Kill Brutus, and be honour’d in his death.  FIRST SOLDIER. We must not. A noble prisoner!  SECOND SOLDIER. Room, ho! Tell Antony, Brutus is ta’en.  FIRST SOLDIER. I’ll tell the news. Here comes the General.  Enter Antony.  Brutus is ta’en, Brutus is ta’en, my lord.  ANTONY. Where is he?  LUCILIUS. Safe, Antony; Brutus is safe enough. I dare assure thee that no enemy Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus. The gods defend him from so great a shame! When you do find him, or alive or dead, He will be found like Brutus, like himself.  ANTONY. This is not Brutus, friend; but, I assure you, A prize no less in worth. Keep this man safe, Give him all kindness. I had rather have Such men my friends than enemies. Go on, And see whether Brutus be alive or dead; And bring us word unto Octavius’ tent How everything is chanc’d.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE V. Another part of the field.  Enter Brutus, Dardanius, Clitus, Strato and Volumnius.  BRUTUS. Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.  CLITUS. Statilius show’d the torch-light; but, my lord, He came not back: he is or ta’en or slain.  BRUTUS. Sit thee down, Clitus. Slaying is the word; It is a deed in fashion. Hark thee, Clitus.  [_Whispering._]  CLITUS. What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.  BRUTUS. Peace then, no words.  CLITUS. I’ll rather kill myself.  BRUTUS. Hark thee, Dardanius.  [_Whispers him._]  DARDANIUS. Shall I do such a deed?  CLITUS. O Dardanius!  DARDANIUS. O Clitus!  CLITUS. What ill request did Brutus make to thee?  DARDANIUS. To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates.  CLITUS. Now is that noble vessel full of grief, That it runs over even at his eyes.  BRUTUS. Come hither, good Volumnius; list a word.  VOLUMNIUS. What says my lord?  BRUTUS. Why, this, Volumnius: The ghost of Caesar hath appear’d to me Two several times by night; at Sardis once, And this last night here in Philippi fields. I know my hour is come.  VOLUMNIUS. Not so, my lord.  BRUTUS. Nay I am sure it is, Volumnius. Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes; Our enemies have beat us to the pit.  [_Low alarums._]  It is more worthy to leap in ourselves Than tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius, Thou know’st that we two went to school together; Even for that our love of old, I pr’ythee Hold thou my sword-hilts, whilst I run on it.  VOLUMNIUS. That’s not an office for a friend, my lord.  [_Alarums still._]  CLITUS. Fly, fly, my lord! there is no tarrying here.  BRUTUS. Farewell to you; and you; and you, Volumnius. Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep; Farewell to thee too, Strato.—Countrymen, My heart doth joy, that yet in all my life I found no man but he was true to me. I shall have glory by this losing day More than Octavius and Mark Antony By this vile conquest shall attain unto. So fare you well at once; for Brutus’ tongue Hath almost ended his life’s history. Night hangs upon mine eyes; my bones would rest, That have but labour’d to attain this hour.  [_Alarums. Cry within, “Fly, fly, fly!”._]  CLITUS. Fly, my lord, fly!  BRUTUS. Hence! I will follow.  [_Exeunt Clitus, Dardanius and Volumnius._]  I pr’ythee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord. Thou art a fellow of a good respect; Thy life hath had some smatch of honour in it. Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face, While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?  STRATO. Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord.  BRUTUS. Farewell, good Strato.—Caesar, now be still: I kill’d not thee with half so good a will.  [_He runs on his sword, and dies._]  Alarum. Retreat. Enter Antony, Octavius, Messala, Lucilius and the Army.  OCTAVIUS. What man is that?  MESSALA. My master’s man. Strato, where is thy master?  STRATO. Free from the bondage you are in, Messala. The conquerors can but make a fire of him; For Brutus only overcame himself, And no man else hath honour by his death.  LUCILIUS. So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus, That thou hast prov’d Lucilius’ saying true.  OCTAVIUS. All that serv’d Brutus, I will entertain them. Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?  STRATO. Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.  OCTAVIUS. Do so, good Messala.  MESSALA. How died my master, Strato?  STRATO. I held the sword, and he did run on it.  MESSALA. Octavius, then take him to follow thee, That did the latest service to my master.  ANTONY. This was the noblest Roman of them all. All the conspirators save only he, Did that they did in envy of great Caesar; He only, in a general honest thought And common good to all, made one of them. His life was gentle, and the elements So mix’d in him that Nature might stand up And say to all the world, “This was a man!”  OCTAVIUS. According to his virtue let us use him With all respect and rites of burial. Within my tent his bones tonight shall lie, Most like a soldier, order’d honourably. So call the field to rest, and let’s away, To part the glories of this happy day.  [_Exeunt._]

 Enter Kent, Gloucester and Edmund.  KENT. I thought the King had more affected the Duke of Albany than Cornwall.  GLOUCESTER. It did always seem so to us; but now, in the division of the kingdom, it appears not which of the Dukes he values most, for qualities are so weighed that curiosity in neither can make choice of either’s moiety.  KENT. Is not this your son, my lord?  GLOUCESTER. His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I have so often blush’d to acknowledge him that now I am braz’d to’t.  KENT. I cannot conceive you.  GLOUCESTER. Sir, this young fellow’s mother could; whereupon she grew round-wombed, and had indeed, sir, a son for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed. Do you smell a fault?  KENT. I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being so proper.  GLOUCESTER. But I have a son, sir, by order of law, some year elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account: though this knave came something saucily to the world before he was sent for, yet was his mother fair; there was good sport at his making, and the whoreson must be acknowledged. Do you know this noble gentleman, Edmund?  EDMUND. No, my lord.  GLOUCESTER. My Lord of Kent: remember him hereafter as my honourable friend.  EDMUND. My services to your lordship.  KENT. I must love you, and sue to know you better.  EDMUND. Sir, I shall study deserving.  GLOUCESTER. He hath been out nine years, and away he shall again. The King is coming.   [_Sennet within._]   Enter Lear, Cornwall, Albany, Goneril, Regan, Cordelia and Attendants.  LEAR. Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.  GLOUCESTER. I shall, my lord.   [_Exeunt Gloucester and Edmund._]  LEAR. Meantime we shall express our darker purpose. Give me the map there. Know that we have divided In three our kingdom: and ’tis our fast intent To shake all cares and business from our age; Conferring them on younger strengths, while we Unburden’d crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall, And you, our no less loving son of Albany, We have this hour a constant will to publish Our daughters’ several dowers, that future strife May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy, Great rivals in our youngest daughter’s love, Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn, And here are to be answer’d. Tell me, my daughters,— Since now we will divest us both of rule, Interest of territory, cares of state,— Which of you shall we say doth love us most? That we our largest bounty may extend Where nature doth with merit challenge.—Goneril, Our eldest born, speak first.  GONERIL. Sir, I love you more than word can wield the matter; Dearer than eyesight, space, and liberty; Beyond what can be valu’d, rich or rare; No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour; As much as child e’er lov’d, or father found; A love that makes breath poor and speech unable; Beyond all manner of so much I love you.  CORDELIA. [_Aside._] What shall Cordelia speak? Love, and be silent.  LEAR. Of all these bounds, even from this line to this, With shadowy forests and with champains rich’d, With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads, We make thee lady: to thine and Albany’s issue Be this perpetual.—What says our second daughter, Our dearest Regan, wife of Cornwall? Speak.  REGAN. Sir, I am made of the self mettle as my sister, And prize me at her worth. In my true heart I find she names my very deed of love; Only she comes too short, that I profess Myself an enemy to all other joys Which the most precious square of sense possesses, And find I am alone felicitate In your dear highness’ love.  CORDELIA. [_Aside._] Then poor Cordelia, And yet not so; since, I am sure, my love’s More ponderous than my tongue.  LEAR. To thee and thine hereditary ever Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom; No less in space, validity, and pleasure Than that conferr’d on Goneril.—Now, our joy, Although the last and least; to whose young love The vines of France and milk of Burgundy Strive to be interess’d; what can you say to draw A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.  CORDELIA. Nothing, my lord.  LEAR. Nothing?  CORDELIA. Nothing.  LEAR. Nothing will come of nothing: speak again.  CORDELIA. Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave My heart into my mouth: I love your majesty According to my bond; no more nor less.  LEAR. How, how, Cordelia? Mend your speech a little, Lest you may mar your fortunes.  CORDELIA. Good my lord, You have begot me, bred me, lov’d me: I Return those duties back as are right fit, Obey you, love you, and most honour you. Why have my sisters husbands if they say They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed, That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry Half my love with him, half my care and duty: Sure I shall never marry like my sisters, To love my father all.  LEAR. But goes thy heart with this?  CORDELIA. Ay, my good lord.  LEAR. So young, and so untender?  CORDELIA. So young, my lord, and true.  LEAR. Let it be so, thy truth then be thy dower: For, by the sacred radiance of the sun, The mysteries of Hecate and the night; By all the operation of the orbs, From whom we do exist and cease to be; Here I disclaim all my paternal care, Propinquity and property of blood, And as a stranger to my heart and me Hold thee from this for ever. The barbarous Scythian, Or he that makes his generation messes To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom Be as well neighbour’d, pitied, and reliev’d, As thou my sometime daughter.  KENT. Good my liege,—  LEAR. Peace, Kent! Come not between the dragon and his wrath. I lov’d her most, and thought to set my rest On her kind nursery. [_To Cordelia._] Hence and avoid my sight! So be my grave my peace, as here I give Her father’s heart from her! Call France. Who stirs? Call Burgundy! Cornwall and Albany, With my two daughters’ dowers digest this third: Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her. I do invest you jointly with my power, Pre-eminence, and all the large effects That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course, With reservation of an hundred knights, By you to be sustain’d, shall our abode Make with you by due turn. Only we shall retain The name, and all the addition to a king; the sway, Revenue, execution of the rest, Beloved sons, be yours; which to confirm, This coronet part between you.  [_Giving the crown._]  KENT. Royal Lear, Whom I have ever honour’d as my king, Lov’d as my father, as my master follow’d, As my great patron thought on in my prayers.—  LEAR. The bow is bent and drawn; make from the shaft.  KENT. Let it fall rather, though the fork invade The region of my heart: be Kent unmannerly When Lear is mad. What wouldst thou do, old man? Think’st thou that duty shall have dread to speak, When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour’s bound When majesty falls to folly. Reverse thy state; And in thy best consideration check This hideous rashness: answer my life my judgement, Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least; Nor are those empty-hearted, whose low sounds Reverb no hollowness.  LEAR. Kent, on thy life, no more.  KENT. My life I never held but as a pawn To wage against thine enemies; ne’er fear to lose it, Thy safety being the motive.  LEAR. Out of my sight!  KENT. See better, Lear; and let me still remain The true blank of thine eye.  LEAR. Now, by Apollo,—  KENT. Now by Apollo, King, Thou swear’st thy gods in vain.  LEAR. O vassal! Miscreant!   [_Laying his hand on his sword._]  ALBANY and CORNWALL. Dear sir, forbear!  KENT. Kill thy physician, and the fee bestow Upon the foul disease. Revoke thy gift, Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat, I’ll tell thee thou dost evil.  LEAR. Hear me, recreant! on thine allegiance, hear me! Since thou hast sought to make us break our vows, Which we durst never yet, and with strain’d pride To come betwixt our sentences and our power, Which nor our nature, nor our place can bear, Our potency made good, take thy reward. Five days we do allot thee for provision, To shield thee from disasters of the world; And on the sixth to turn thy hated back Upon our kingdom: if, on the next day following, Thy banish’d trunk be found in our dominions, The moment is thy death. Away! By Jupiter, This shall not be revok’d.  KENT. Fare thee well, King: sith thus thou wilt appear, Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here. [_To Cordelia._] The gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid, That justly think’st and hast most rightly said! [_To Goneril and Regan._] And your large speeches may your deeds approve, That good effects may spring from words of love. Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu; He’ll shape his old course in a country new.   [_Exit._]   Flourish. Re-enter Gloucester, with France, Burgundy and Attendants.  CORDELIA. Here’s France and Burgundy, my noble lord.  LEAR. My Lord of Burgundy, We first address toward you, who with this king Hath rivall’d for our daughter: what in the least Will you require in present dower with her, Or cease your quest of love?  BURGUNDY. Most royal majesty, I crave no more than hath your highness offer’d, Nor will you tender less.  LEAR. Right noble Burgundy, When she was dear to us, we did hold her so; But now her price is fall’n. Sir, there she stands: If aught within that little-seeming substance, Or all of it, with our displeasure piec’d, And nothing more, may fitly like your grace, She’s there, and she is yours.  BURGUNDY. I know no answer.  LEAR. Will you, with those infirmities she owes, Unfriended, new adopted to our hate, Dower’d with our curse, and stranger’d with our oath, Take her or leave her?  BURGUNDY. Pardon me, royal sir; Election makes not up in such conditions.  LEAR. Then leave her, sir; for, by the power that made me, I tell you all her wealth. [_To France_] For you, great king, I would not from your love make such a stray To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you T’avert your liking a more worthier way Than on a wretch whom nature is asham’d Almost t’acknowledge hers.  FRANCE. This is most strange, That she, who even but now was your best object, The argument of your praise, balm of your age, The best, the dearest, should in this trice of time Commit a thing so monstrous, to dismantle So many folds of favour. Sure her offence Must be of such unnatural degree That monsters it, or your fore-vouch’d affection Fall into taint; which to believe of her Must be a faith that reason without miracle Should never plant in me.  CORDELIA. I yet beseech your majesty, If for I want that glib and oily art To speak and purpose not; since what I well intend, I’ll do’t before I speak,—that you make known It is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness, No unchaste action or dishonour’d step, That hath depriv’d me of your grace and favour; But even for want of that for which I am richer, A still soliciting eye, and such a tongue As I am glad I have not, though not to have it Hath lost me in your liking.  LEAR. Better thou hadst Not been born than not to have pleas’d me better.  FRANCE. Is it but this?—a tardiness in nature Which often leaves the history unspoke That it intends to do? My lord of Burgundy, What say you to the lady? Love’s not love When it is mingled with regards that stands Aloof from the entire point. Will you have her? She is herself a dowry.  BURGUNDY. Royal King, Give but that portion which yourself propos’d, And here I take Cordelia by the hand, Duchess of Burgundy.  LEAR. Nothing: I have sworn; I am firm.  BURGUNDY. I am sorry, then, you have so lost a father That you must lose a husband.  CORDELIA. Peace be with Burgundy! Since that respects of fortunes are his love, I shall not be his wife.  FRANCE. Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor; Most choice forsaken; and most lov’d, despis’d! Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon: Be it lawful, I take up what’s cast away. Gods, gods! ’Tis strange that from their cold’st neglect My love should kindle to inflam’d respect. Thy dowerless daughter, King, thrown to my chance, Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France: Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy Can buy this unpriz’d precious maid of me. Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind: Thou losest here, a better where to find.  LEAR. Thou hast her, France: let her be thine; for we Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see That face of hers again. Therefore be gone Without our grace, our love, our benison. Come, noble Burgundy.   [_Flourish. Exeunt Lear, Burgundy, Cornwall, Albany, Gloucester and  Attendants._]  FRANCE. Bid farewell to your sisters.  CORDELIA. The jewels of our father, with wash’d eyes Cordelia leaves you: I know you what you are; And like a sister am most loath to call Your faults as they are nam’d. Love well our father: To your professed bosoms I commit him: But yet, alas, stood I within his grace, I would prefer him to a better place. So farewell to you both.  REGAN. Prescribe not us our duties.  GONERIL. Let your study Be to content your lord, who hath receiv’d you At fortune’s alms. You have obedience scanted, And well are worth the want that you have wanted.  CORDELIA. Time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides: Who covers faults, at last shame derides. Well may you prosper.  FRANCE. Come, my fair Cordelia.   [_Exeunt France and Cordelia._]  GONERIL. Sister, it is not little I have to say of what most nearly appertains to us both. I think our father will hence tonight.  REGAN. That’s most certain, and with you; next month with us.  GONERIL. You see how full of changes his age is; the observation we have made of it hath not been little: he always loved our sister most; and with what poor judgement he hath now cast her off appears too grossly.  REGAN. ’Tis the infirmity of his age: yet he hath ever but slenderly known himself.  GONERIL. The best and soundest of his time hath been but rash; then must we look from his age to receive not alone the imperfections of long-engrafted condition, but therewithal the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring with them.  REGAN. Such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of Kent’s banishment.  GONERIL. There is further compliment of leave-taking between France and him. Pray you let us hit together: if our father carry authority with such disposition as he bears, this last surrender of his will but offend us.  REGAN. We shall further think of it.  GONERIL. We must do something, and i’ th’ heat.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. A Hall in the Earl of Gloucester’s Castle   Enter Edmund with a letter.  EDMUND. Thou, Nature, art my goddess; to thy law My services are bound. Wherefore should I Stand in the plague of custom, and permit The curiosity of nations to deprive me? For that I am some twelve or fourteen moonshines Lag of a brother? Why bastard? Wherefore base? When my dimensions are as well compact, My mind as generous, and my shape as true As honest madam’s issue? Why brand they us With base? With baseness? bastardy? Base, base? Who, in the lusty stealth of nature, take More composition and fierce quality Than doth within a dull stale tired bed Go to the creating a whole tribe of fops Got ’tween asleep and wake? Well then, Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land: Our father’s love is to the bastard Edmund As to the legitimate: fine word: legitimate! Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed, And my invention thrive, Edmund the base Shall top the legitimate. I grow, I prosper. Now, gods, stand up for bastards!   Enter Gloucester.  GLOUCESTER. Kent banish’d thus! and France in choler parted! And the King gone tonight! Prescrib’d his pow’r! Confin’d to exhibition! All this done Upon the gad!—Edmund, how now! What news?  EDMUND. So please your lordship, none.   [_Putting up the letter._]  GLOUCESTER. Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?  EDMUND. I know no news, my lord.  GLOUCESTER. What paper were you reading?  EDMUND. Nothing, my lord.  GLOUCESTER. No? What needed then that terrible dispatch of it into your pocket? The quality of nothing hath not such need to hide itself. Let’s see. Come, if it be nothing, I shall not need spectacles.  EDMUND. I beseech you, sir, pardon me. It is a letter from my brother that I have not all o’er-read; and for so much as I have perus’d, I find it not fit for your o’er-looking.  GLOUCESTER. Give me the letter, sir.  EDMUND. I shall offend, either to detain or give it. The contents, as in part I understand them, are to blame.  GLOUCESTER. Let’s see, let’s see!  EDMUND. I hope, for my brother’s justification, he wrote this but as an essay, or taste of my virtue.  GLOUCESTER. [_Reads._] ‘This policy and reverence of age makes the world bitter to the best of our times; keeps our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish them. I begin to find an idle and fond bondage in the oppression of aged tyranny; who sways not as it hath power, but as it is suffered. Come to me, that of this I may speak more. If our father would sleep till I waked him, you should enjoy half his revenue for ever, and live the beloved of your brother EDGAR.’ Hum! Conspiracy? ‘Sleep till I wake him, you should enjoy half his revenue.’—My son Edgar! Had he a hand to write this? A heart and brain to breed it in? When came this to you? Who brought it?  EDMUND. It was not brought me, my lord, there’s the cunning of it. I found it thrown in at the casement of my closet.  GLOUCESTER. You know the character to be your brother’s?  EDMUND. If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear it were his; but in respect of that, I would fain think it were not.  GLOUCESTER. It is his.  EDMUND. It is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is not in the contents.  GLOUCESTER. Has he never before sounded you in this business?  EDMUND. Never, my lord. But I have heard him oft maintain it to be fit that, sons at perfect age, and fathers declined, the father should be as ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue.  GLOUCESTER. O villain, villain! His very opinion in the letter! Abhorred villain! Unnatural, detested, brutish villain! worse than brutish! Go, sirrah, seek him; I’ll apprehend him. Abominable villain, Where is he?  EDMUND. I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please you to suspend your indignation against my brother till you can derive from him better testimony of his intent, you should run a certain course; where, if you violently proceed against him, mistaking his purpose, it would make a great gap in your own honour, and shake in pieces the heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my life for him, that he hath writ this to feel my affection to your honour, and to no other pretence of danger.  GLOUCESTER. Think you so?  EDMUND. If your honour judge it meet, I will place you where you shall hear us confer of this, and by an auricular assurance have your satisfaction, and that without any further delay than this very evening.  GLOUCESTER. He cannot be such a monster.  EDMUND. Nor is not, sure.  GLOUCESTER. To his father, that so tenderly and entirely loves him. Heaven and earth! Edmund, seek him out; wind me into him, I pray you: frame the business after your own wisdom. I would unstate myself to be in a due resolution.  EDMUND. I will seek him, sir, presently; convey the business as I shall find means, and acquaint you withal.  GLOUCESTER. These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us: though the wisdom of Nature can reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself scourged by the sequent effects. Love cools, friendship falls off, brothers divide: in cities, mutinies; in countries, discord; in palaces, treason; and the bond cracked ’twixt son and father. This villain of mine comes under the prediction; there’s son against father: the King falls from bias of nature; there’s father against child. We have seen the best of our time. Machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves. Find out this villain, Edmund; it shall lose thee nothing; do it carefully.—And the noble and true-hearted Kent banished! his offence, honesty! ’Tis strange.   [_Exit._]  EDMUND. This is the excellent foppery of the world, that, when we are sick in fortune, often the surfeits of our own behaviour, we make guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars; as if we were villains on necessity; fools by heavenly compulsion; knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical predominance; drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforced obedience of planetary influence; and all that we are evil in, by a divine thrusting on. An admirable evasion of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish disposition to the charge of a star. My father compounded with my mother under the dragon’s tail, and my nativity was under Ursa Major, so that it follows I am rough and lecherous. Fut! I should have been that I am, had the maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my bastardizing.   Enter Edgar.  Pat! he comes, like the catastrophe of the old comedy: my cue is villainous melancholy, with a sigh like Tom o’Bedlam.—O, these eclipses do portend these divisions! Fa, sol, la, mi.  EDGAR. How now, brother Edmund, what serious contemplation are you in?  EDMUND. I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read this other day, what should follow these eclipses.  EDGAR. Do you busy yourself with that?  EDMUND. I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed unhappily: as of unnaturalness between the child and the parent; death, dearth, dissolutions of ancient amities; divisions in state, menaces and maledictions against King and nobles; needless diffidences, banishment of friends, dissipation of cohorts, nuptial breaches, and I know not what.  EDGAR. How long have you been a sectary astronomical?  EDMUND. Come, come! when saw you my father last?  EDGAR. The night gone by.  EDMUND. Spake you with him?  EDGAR. Ay, two hours together.  EDMUND. Parted you in good terms? Found you no displeasure in him, by word nor countenance?  EDGAR. None at all.  EDMUND. Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended him: and at my entreaty forbear his presence until some little time hath qualified the heat of his displeasure; which at this instant so rageth in him that with the mischief of your person it would scarcely allay.  EDGAR. Some villain hath done me wrong.  EDMUND. That’s my fear. I pray you have a continent forbearance till the speed of his rage goes slower; and, as I say, retire with me to my lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to hear my lord speak: pray ye, go; there’s my key. If you do stir abroad, go armed.  EDGAR. Armed, brother?  EDMUND. Brother, I advise you to the best; I am no honest man if there be any good meaning toward you: I have told you what I have seen and heard. But faintly; nothing like the image and horror of it: pray you, away!  EDGAR. Shall I hear from you anon?  EDMUND. I do serve you in this business.   [_Exit Edgar._]  A credulous father! and a brother noble, Whose nature is so far from doing harms That he suspects none; on whose foolish honesty My practices ride easy! I see the business. Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit; All with me’s meet that I can fashion fit.   [_Exit._]  SCENE III. A Room in the Duke of Albany’s Palace   Enter Goneril and Oswald.  GONERIL. Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool?  OSWALD. Ay, madam.  GONERIL. By day and night, he wrongs me; every hour He flashes into one gross crime or other, That sets us all at odds; I’ll not endure it: His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us On every trifle. When he returns from hunting, I will not speak with him; say I am sick. If you come slack of former services, You shall do well; the fault of it I’ll answer.   [_Horns within._]  OSWALD. He’s coming, madam; I hear him.  GONERIL. Put on what weary negligence you please, You and your fellows; I’d have it come to question: If he distaste it, let him to our sister, Whose mind and mine, I know, in that are one, Not to be overruled. Idle old man, That still would manage those authorities That he hath given away! Now, by my life, Old fools are babes again; and must be us’d With checks as flatteries, when they are seen abus’d. Remember what I have said.  OSWALD. Very well, madam.  GONERIL. And let his knights have colder looks among you; What grows of it, no matter; advise your fellows so; I would breed from hence occasions, and I shall, That I may speak. I’ll write straight to my sister To hold my very course. Prepare for dinner.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IV. A Hall in Albany’s Palace   Enter Kent, disguised.  KENT. If but as well I other accents borrow, That can my speech defuse, my good intent May carry through itself to that full issue For which I rais’d my likeness. Now, banish’d Kent, If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemn’d, So may it come, thy master, whom thou lov’st, Shall find thee full of labours.   Horns within. Enter King Lear, Knights and Attendants.  LEAR. Let me not stay a jot for dinner; go get it ready.   [_Exit an Attendant._]  How now! what art thou?  KENT. A man, sir.  LEAR. What dost thou profess? What wouldst thou with us?  KENT. I do profess to be no less than I seem; to serve him truly that will put me in trust; to love him that is honest; to converse with him that is wise and says little; to fear judgement; to fight when I cannot choose; and to eat no fish.  LEAR. What art thou?  KENT. A very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as the King.  LEAR. If thou be’st as poor for a subject as he’s for a king, thou art poor enough. What wouldst thou?  KENT. Service.  LEAR. Who wouldst thou serve?  KENT. You.  LEAR. Dost thou know me, fellow?  KENT. No, sir; but you have that in your countenance which I would fain call master.  LEAR. What’s that?  KENT. Authority.  LEAR. What services canst thou do?  KENT. I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curious tale in telling it and deliver a plain message bluntly. That which ordinary men are fit for, I am qualified in, and the best of me is diligence.  LEAR. How old art thou?  KENT. Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing; nor so old to dote on her for anything: I have years on my back forty-eight.  LEAR. Follow me; thou shalt serve me. If I like thee no worse after dinner, I will not part from thee yet. Dinner, ho, dinner! Where’s my knave? my fool? Go you and call my fool hither.   [_Exit an Attendant._]   Enter Oswald.  You, you, sirrah, where’s my daughter?  OSWALD. So please you,—   [_Exit._]  LEAR. What says the fellow there? Call the clotpoll back.   [_Exit a Knight._]  Where’s my fool? Ho, I think the world’s asleep.   Re-enter Knight.  How now! where’s that mongrel?  KNIGHT. He says, my lord, your daughter is not well.  LEAR. Why came not the slave back to me when I called him?  KNIGHT. Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner, he would not.  LEAR. He would not?  KNIGHT. My lord, I know not what the matter is; but to my judgement your highness is not entertained with that ceremonious affection as you were wont; there’s a great abatement of kindness appears as well in the general dependants as in the Duke himself also, and your daughter.  LEAR. Ha! say’st thou so?  KNIGHT. I beseech you pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken; for my duty cannot be silent when I think your highness wronged.  LEAR. Thou but rememberest me of mine own conception: I have perceived a most faint neglect of late; which I have rather blamed as mine own jealous curiosity than as a very pretence and purpose of unkindness: I will look further into’t. But where’s my fool? I have not seen him this two days.  KNIGHT. Since my young lady’s going into France, sir, the fool hath much pined away.  LEAR. No more of that; I have noted it well. Go you and tell my daughter I would speak with her.   [_Exit Attendant._]  Go you, call hither my fool.   [_Exit another Attendant._]   Re-enter Oswald.  O, you, sir, you, come you hither, sir: who am I, sir?  OSWALD. My lady’s father.  LEAR. My lady’s father! my lord’s knave: you whoreson dog! you slave! you cur!  OSWALD. I am none of these, my lord; I beseech your pardon.  LEAR. Do you bandy looks with me, you rascal?   [_Striking him._]  OSWALD. I’ll not be struck, my lord.  KENT. Nor tripp’d neither, you base football player.   [_Tripping up his heels._]  LEAR. I thank thee, fellow. Thou serv’st me, and I’ll love thee.  KENT. Come, sir, arise, away! I’ll teach you differences: away, away! If you will measure your lubber’s length again, tarry; but away! go to; have you wisdom? So.   [_Pushes Oswald out._]  LEAR. Now, my friendly knave, I thank thee: there’s earnest of thy service.   [_Giving Kent money._]   Enter Fool.  FOOL. Let me hire him too; here’s my coxcomb.   [_Giving Kent his cap._]  LEAR. How now, my pretty knave, how dost thou?  FOOL. Sirrah, you were best take my coxcomb.  KENT. Why, fool?  FOOL. Why, for taking one’s part that’s out of favour. Nay, an thou canst not smile as the wind sits, thou’lt catch cold shortly: there, take my coxcomb: why, this fellow has banish’d two on’s daughters, and did the third a blessing against his will; if thou follow him, thou must needs wear my coxcomb. How now, nuncle! Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters!  LEAR. Why, my boy?  FOOL. If I gave them all my living, I’d keep my coxcombs myself. There’s mine; beg another of thy daughters.  LEAR. Take heed, sirrah, the whip.  FOOL. Truth’s a dog must to kennel; he must be whipped out, when the Lady Brach may stand by the fire and stink.  LEAR. A pestilent gall to me!  FOOL. Sirrah, I’ll teach thee a speech.  LEAR. Do.  FOOL. Mark it, nuncle:     Have more than thou showest,     Speak less than thou knowest,     Lend less than thou owest,     Ride more than thou goest,     Learn more than thou trowest,     Set less than thou throwest;     Leave thy drink and thy whore,     And keep in-a-door,     And thou shalt have more     Than two tens to a score.  KENT. This is nothing, fool.  FOOL. Then ’tis like the breath of an unfee’d lawyer, you gave me nothing for’t. Can you make no use of nothing, nuncle?  LEAR. Why, no, boy; nothing can be made out of nothing.  FOOL. [_to Kent._] Prithee tell him, so much the rent of his land comes to: he will not believe a fool.  LEAR. A bitter fool.  FOOL. Dost thou know the difference, my boy, between a bitter fool and a sweet one?  LEAR. No, lad; teach me.  FOOL.    That lord that counsell’d thee      To give away thy land,    Come place him here by me,      Do thou for him stand.    The sweet and bitter fool      Will presently appear;    The one in motley here,      The other found out there.  LEAR. Dost thou call me fool, boy?  FOOL. All thy other titles thou hast given away; that thou wast born with.  KENT. This is not altogether fool, my lord.  FOOL. No, faith; lords and great men will not let me; if I had a monopoly out, they would have part on’t and ladies too, they will not let me have all the fool to myself; they’ll be snatching. Nuncle, give me an egg, and I’ll give thee two crowns.  LEAR. What two crowns shall they be?  FOOL. Why, after I have cut the egg i’ the middle and eat up the meat, the two crowns of the egg. When thou clovest thy crown i’ the middle and gav’st away both parts, thou bor’st thine ass on thy back o’er the dirt: thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown when thou gav’st thy golden one away. If I speak like myself in this, let him be whipped that first finds it so. [_Singing._]    Fools had ne’er less grace in a year;      For wise men are grown foppish,    And know not how their wits to wear,      Their manners are so apish.  LEAR. When were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?  FOOL. I have used it, nuncle, e’er since thou mad’st thy daughters thy mothers; for when thou gav’st them the rod, and put’st down thine own breeches, [_Singing._]    Then they for sudden joy did weep,      And I for sorrow sung,    That such a king should play bo-peep,      And go the fools among. Prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool to lie; I would fain learn to lie.  LEAR. An you lie, sirrah, we’ll have you whipped.  FOOL. I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are: they’ll have me whipped for speaking true; thou’lt have me whipped for lying; and sometimes I am whipped for holding my peace. I had rather be any kind o’thing than a fool: and yet I would not be thee, nuncle: thou hast pared thy wit o’both sides, and left nothing i’ the middle: here comes one o’ the parings.   Enter Goneril.  LEAR. How now, daughter? What makes that frontlet on? Methinks you are too much of late i’ the frown.  FOOL. Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to care for her frowning. Now thou art an O without a figure: I am better than thou art now. I am a fool, thou art nothing. [_To Goneril._] Yes, forsooth, I will hold my tongue. So your face bids me, though you say nothing. Mum, mum,      He that keeps nor crust nor crum,      Weary of all, shall want some. [_Pointing to Lear_.] That’s a shealed peascod.  GONERIL. Not only, sir, this your all-licens’d fool, But other of your insolent retinue Do hourly carp and quarrel; breaking forth In rank and not-to-be-endured riots. Sir, I had thought, by making this well known unto you, To have found a safe redress; but now grow fearful, By what yourself too late have spoke and done, That you protect this course, and put it on By your allowance; which if you should, the fault Would not scape censure, nor the redresses sleep, Which, in the tender of a wholesome weal, Might in their working do you that offence Which else were shame, that then necessity Will call discreet proceeding.  FOOL. For you know, nuncle,    The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long    That it’s had it head bit off by it young. So out went the candle, and we were left darkling.  LEAR. Are you our daughter?  GONERIL. Come, sir, I would you would make use of that good wisdom, Whereof I know you are fraught; and put away These dispositions, which of late transform you From what you rightly are.  FOOL. May not an ass know when the cart draws the horse? Whoop, Jug! I love thee!  LEAR. Doth any here know me? This is not Lear; Doth Lear walk thus? speak thus? Where are his eyes? Either his notion weakens, his discernings Are lethargied. Ha! waking? ’Tis not so! Who is it that can tell me who I am?  FOOL. Lear’s shadow.  LEAR. I would learn that; for by the marks of sovereignty, knowledge and reason, I should be false persuaded I had daughters.  FOOL. Which they will make an obedient father.  LEAR. Your name, fair gentlewoman?  GONERIL. This admiration, sir, is much o’ the favour Of other your new pranks. I do beseech you To understand my purposes aright: As you are old and reverend, you should be wise. Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires; Men so disorder’d, so debosh’d and bold That this our court, infected with their manners, Shows like a riotous inn. Epicurism and lust Makes it more like a tavern or a brothel Than a grac’d palace. The shame itself doth speak For instant remedy. Be, then, desir’d By her that else will take the thing she begs A little to disquantity your train; And the remainder that shall still depend, To be such men as may besort your age, Which know themselves, and you.  LEAR. Darkness and devils! Saddle my horses; call my train together. Degenerate bastard! I’ll not trouble thee: Yet have I left a daughter.  GONERIL. You strike my people; and your disorder’d rabble Make servants of their betters.   Enter Albany.  LEAR. Woe that too late repents!— [_To Albany._] O, sir, are you come? Is it your will? Speak, sir.—Prepare my horses. Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend, More hideous when thou show’st thee in a child Than the sea-monster!  ALBANY. Pray, sir, be patient.  LEAR. [_to Goneril._] Detested kite, thou liest. My train are men of choice and rarest parts, That all particulars of duty know; And in the most exact regard support The worships of their name. O most small fault, How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show! Which, like an engine, wrench’d my frame of nature From the fix’d place; drew from my heart all love, And added to the gall. O Lear, Lear, Lear! [_Striking his head._] Beat at this gate that let thy folly in And thy dear judgement out! Go, go, my people.  ALBANY. My lord, I am guiltless, as I am ignorant Of what hath moved you.  LEAR. It may be so, my lord. Hear, nature, hear; dear goddess, hear! Suspend thy purpose, if thou didst intend To make this creature fruitful! Into her womb convey sterility! Dry up in her the organs of increase; And from her derogate body never spring A babe to honour her! If she must teem, Create her child of spleen, that it may live And be a thwart disnatur’d torment to her! Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth; With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks; Turn all her mother’s pains and benefits To laughter and contempt; that she may feel How sharper than a serpent’s tooth it is To have a thankless child! Away, away!   [_Exit._]  ALBANY. Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?  GONERIL. Never afflict yourself to know more of it; But let his disposition have that scope That dotage gives it.   Re-enter Lear.  LEAR. What, fifty of my followers at a clap? Within a fortnight?  ALBANY. What’s the matter, sir?  LEAR. I’ll tell thee. [_To Goneril._] Life and death! I am asham’d That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus; That these hot tears, which break from me perforce, Should make thee worth them. Blasts and fogs upon thee! Th’untented woundings of a father’s curse Pierce every sense about thee! Old fond eyes, Beweep this cause again, I’ll pluck ye out, And cast you with the waters that you lose To temper clay. Ha! Let it be so. I have another daughter, Who, I am sure, is kind and comfortable: When she shall hear this of thee, with her nails She’ll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find That I’ll resume the shape which thou dost think I have cast off for ever.   [_Exeunt Lear, Kent and Attendants._]  GONERIL. Do you mark that?  ALBANY. I cannot be so partial, Goneril, To the great love I bear you,—  GONERIL. Pray you, content. What, Oswald, ho! [_To the Fool._] You, sir, more knave than fool, after your master.  FOOL. Nuncle Lear, nuncle Lear, tarry and take the fool with thee.    A fox when one has caught her,    And such a daughter,    Should sure to the slaughter,    If my cap would buy a halter;    So the fool follows after.   [_Exit._]  GONERIL. This man hath had good counsel.—A hundred knights! ’Tis politic and safe to let him keep At point a hundred knights: yes, that on every dream, Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike, He may enguard his dotage with their powers, And hold our lives in mercy. Oswald, I say!  ALBANY. Well, you may fear too far.  GONERIL. Safer than trust too far: Let me still take away the harms I fear, Not fear still to be taken: I know his heart. What he hath utter’d I have writ my sister: If she sustain him and his hundred knights, When I have show’d th’unfitness,—   Re-enter Oswald.  How now, Oswald! What, have you writ that letter to my sister?  OSWALD. Ay, madam.  GONERIL. Take you some company, and away to horse: Inform her full of my particular fear; And thereto add such reasons of your own As may compact it more. Get you gone; And hasten your return.   [_Exit Oswald._]  No, no, my lord! This milky gentleness and course of yours, Though I condemn not, yet, under pardon, You are much more attask’d for want of wisdom Than prais’d for harmful mildness.  ALBANY. How far your eyes may pierce I cannot tell: Striving to better, oft we mar what’s well.  GONERIL. Nay then,—  ALBANY. Well, well; the event.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE V. Court before the Duke of Albany’s Palace   Enter Lear, Kent and Fool.  LEAR. Go you before to Gloucester with these letters: acquaint my daughter no further with anything you know than comes from her demand out of the letter. If your diligence be not speedy, I shall be there afore you.  KENT. I will not sleep, my lord, till I have delivered your letter.   [_Exit._]  FOOL. If a man’s brains were in’s heels, were’t not in danger of kibes?  LEAR. Ay, boy.  FOOL. Then I prithee be merry; thy wit shall not go slipshod.  LEAR. Ha, ha, ha!  FOOL. Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly, for though she’s as like this as a crab’s like an apple, yet I can tell what I can tell.  LEAR. What canst tell, boy?  FOOL. She’ll taste as like this as a crab does to a crab. Thou canst tell why one’s nose stands i’the middle on’s face?  LEAR. No.  FOOL. Why, to keep one’s eyes of either side’s nose, that what a man cannot smell out, he may spy into.  LEAR. I did her wrong.  FOOL. Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?  LEAR. No.  FOOL. Nor I neither; but I can tell why a snail has a house.  LEAR. Why?  FOOL. Why, to put’s head in; not to give it away to his daughters, and leave his horns without a case.  LEAR. I will forget my nature. So kind a father! Be my horses ready?  FOOL. Thy asses are gone about ’em. The reason why the seven stars are no more than seven is a pretty reason.  LEAR. Because they are not eight?  FOOL. Yes indeed: thou wouldst make a good fool.  LEAR. To tak’t again perforce!—Monster ingratitude!  FOOL. If thou wert my fool, nuncle, I’d have thee beaten for being old before thy time.  LEAR. How’s that?  FOOL. Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst been wise.  LEAR. O, let me not be mad, not mad, sweet heaven! Keep me in temper; I would not be mad!   Enter Gentleman.  How now? are the horses ready?  GENTLEMAN. Ready, my lord.  LEAR. Come, boy.  FOOL. She that’s a maid now, and laughs at my departure, Shall not be a maid long, unless things be cut shorter.   [_Exeunt._]
  ACT II  SCENE I. A court within the Castle of the Earl of Gloucester
 Enter Edmund and Curan, meeting.  EDMUND. Save thee, Curan.  CURAN. And you, sir. I have been with your father, and given him notice that the Duke of Cornwall and Regan his Duchess will be here with him this night.  EDMUND. How comes that?  CURAN. Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news abroad; I mean the whispered ones, for they are yet but ear-kissing arguments?  EDMUND. Not I: pray you, what are they?  CURAN. Have you heard of no likely wars toward, ’twixt the two dukes of Cornwall and Albany?  EDMUND. Not a word.  CURAN. You may do, then, in time. Fare you well, sir.   [_Exit._]  EDMUND. The Duke be here tonight? The better! best! This weaves itself perforce into my business. My father hath set guard to take my brother; And I have one thing, of a queasy question, Which I must act. Briefness and fortune work! Brother, a word, descend, brother, I say!   Enter Edgar.  My father watches: O sir, fly this place; Intelligence is given where you are hid; You have now the good advantage of the night. Have you not spoken ’gainst the Duke of Cornwall? He’s coming hither; now, i’ the night, i’ the haste, And Regan with him: have you nothing said Upon his party ’gainst the Duke of Albany? Advise yourself.  EDGAR. I am sure on’t, not a word.  EDMUND. I hear my father coming:—pardon me; In cunning I must draw my sword upon you: Draw: seem to defend yourself: now quit you well. Yield: come before my father. Light, ho, here! Fly, brother. Torches, torches!—So farewell.   [_Exit Edgar._]  Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion Of my more fierce endeavour: [_Wounds his arm._] I have seen drunkards Do more than this in sport. Father, father! Stop, stop! No help?   Enter Gloucester and Servants with torches.  GLOUCESTER. Now, Edmund, where’s the villain?  EDMUND. Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out, Mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moon To stand auspicious mistress.  GLOUCESTER. But where is he?  EDMUND. Look, sir, I bleed.  GLOUCESTER. Where is the villain, Edmund?  EDMUND. Fled this way, sir. When by no means he could,—  GLOUCESTER. Pursue him, ho! Go after.   [_Exeunt Servants._]  —By no means what?  EDMUND. Persuade me to the murder of your lordship; But that I told him the revenging gods ’Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend; Spoke with how manifold and strong a bond The child was bound to the father; sir, in fine, Seeing how loathly opposite I stood To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion With his prepared sword, he charges home My unprovided body, latch’d mine arm; But when he saw my best alarum’d spirits, Bold in the quarrel’s right, rous’d to th’encounter, Or whether gasted by the noise I made, Full suddenly he fled.  GLOUCESTER. Let him fly far; Not in this land shall he remain uncaught; And found—dispatch’d. The noble Duke my master, My worthy arch and patron, comes tonight: By his authority I will proclaim it, That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks, Bringing the murderous coward to the stake; He that conceals him, death.  EDMUND. When I dissuaded him from his intent, And found him pight to do it, with curst speech I threaten’d to discover him: he replied, ‘Thou unpossessing bastard! dost thou think, If I would stand against thee, would the reposal Of any trust, virtue, or worth in thee Make thy words faith’d? No: what I should deny As this I would; ay, though thou didst produce My very character, I’d turn it all To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practice: And thou must make a dullard of the world, If they not thought the profits of my death Were very pregnant and potential spurs To make thee seek it.  GLOUCESTER. O strange and fast’ned villain! Would he deny his letter, said he? I never got him.   [_Tucket within._]  Hark, the Duke’s trumpets! I know not why he comes. All ports I’ll bar; the villain shall not scape; The Duke must grant me that: besides, his picture I will send far and near, that all the kingdom May have due note of him; and of my land, Loyal and natural boy, I’ll work the means To make thee capable.   Enter Cornwall, Regan and Attendants.  CORNWALL. How now, my noble friend! since I came hither, Which I can call but now, I have heard strange news.  REGAN. If it be true, all vengeance comes too short Which can pursue th’offender. How dost, my lord?  GLOUCESTER. O madam, my old heart is crack’d, it’s crack’d!  REGAN. What, did my father’s godson seek your life? He whom my father nam’d? your Edgar?  GLOUCESTER. O lady, lady, shame would have it hid!  REGAN. Was he not companion with the riotous knights That tend upon my father?  GLOUCESTER. I know not, madam; ’tis too bad, too bad.  EDMUND. Yes, madam, he was of that consort.  REGAN. No marvel then though he were ill affected: ’Tis they have put him on the old man’s death, To have the expense and waste of his revenues. I have this present evening from my sister Been well inform’d of them; and with such cautions That if they come to sojourn at my house, I’ll not be there.  CORNWALL. Nor I, assure thee, Regan. Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father A childlike office.  EDMUND. It was my duty, sir.  GLOUCESTER. He did bewray his practice; and receiv’d This hurt you see, striving to apprehend him.  CORNWALL. Is he pursued?  GLOUCESTER. Ay, my good lord.  CORNWALL. If he be taken, he shall never more Be fear’d of doing harm: make your own purpose, How in my strength you please. For you, Edmund, Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant So much commend itself, you shall be ours: Natures of such deep trust we shall much need; You we first seize on.  EDMUND. I shall serve you, sir, truly, however else.  GLOUCESTER. For him I thank your grace.  CORNWALL. You know not why we came to visit you?  REGAN. Thus out of season, threading dark-ey’d night: Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise, Wherein we must have use of your advice. Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister, Of differences, which I best thought it fit To answer from our home; the several messengers From hence attend dispatch. Our good old friend, Lay comforts to your bosom; and bestow Your needful counsel to our business, Which craves the instant use.  GLOUCESTER. I serve you, madam: Your graces are right welcome.   [_Exeunt. Flourish._]  SCENE II. Before Gloucester’s Castle   Enter Kent and Oswald, severally.  OSWALD. Good dawning to thee, friend: art of this house?  KENT. Ay.  OSWALD. Where may we set our horses?  KENT. I’ the mire.  OSWALD. Prithee, if thou lov’st me, tell me.  KENT. I love thee not.  OSWALD. Why then, I care not for thee.  KENT. If I had thee in Lipsbury pinfold, I would make thee care for me.  OSWALD. Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not.  KENT. Fellow, I know thee.  OSWALD. What dost thou know me for?  KENT. A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; a base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited, hundred-pound, filthy, worsted-stocking knave; a lily-livered, action-taking, whoreson, glass-gazing, super-serviceable, finical rogue; one trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a bawd in way of good service, and art nothing but the composition of a knave, beggar, coward, pander, and the son and heir of a mongrel bitch: one whom I will beat into clamorous whining, if thou deniest the least syllable of thy addition.  OSWALD. Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail on one that’s neither known of thee nor knows thee?  KENT. What a brazen-faced varlet art thou, to deny thou knowest me! Is it two days ago since I tripped up thy heels and beat thee before the King? Draw, you rogue: for, though it be night, yet the moon shines; I’ll make a sop o’ the moonshine of you: draw, you whoreson cullionly barber-monger, draw!   [_Drawing his sword._]  OSWALD. Away! I have nothing to do with thee.  KENT. Draw, you rascal: you come with letters against the King; and take vanity the puppet’s part against the royalty of her father: draw, you rogue, or I’ll so carbonado your shanks:—draw, you rascal; come your ways!  OSWALD. Help, ho! murder! help!  KENT. Strike, you slave; stand, rogue, stand; you neat slave, strike!   [_Beating him._]  OSWALD. Help, ho! murder! murder!   Enter Edmund, Cornwall, Regan, Gloucester and Servants.  EDMUND. How now! What’s the matter? Part!  KENT. With you, goodman boy, if you please: come, I’ll flesh ye; come on, young master.  GLOUCESTER. Weapons! arms! What’s the matter here?  CORNWALL. Keep peace, upon your lives, he dies that strikes again. What is the matter?  REGAN. The messengers from our sister and the King.  CORNWALL. What is your difference? Speak.  OSWALD. I am scarce in breath, my lord.  KENT. No marvel, you have so bestirr’d your valour. You cowardly rascal, nature disclaims in thee; a tailor made thee.  CORNWALL. Thou art a strange fellow: a tailor make a man?  KENT. Ay, a tailor, sir: a stonecutter or a painter could not have made him so ill, though he had been but two years at the trade.  CORNWALL. Speak yet, how grew your quarrel?  OSWALD. This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spared at suit of his grey beard,—  KENT. Thou whoreson zed! thou unnecessary letter! My lord, if you’ll give me leave, I will tread this unbolted villain into mortar and daub the walls of a jakes with him. Spare my grey beard, you wagtail?  CORNWALL. Peace, sirrah! You beastly knave, know you no reverence?  KENT. Yes, sir; but anger hath a privilege.  CORNWALL. Why art thou angry?  KENT. That such a slave as this should wear a sword, Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these, Like rats, oft bite the holy cords a-twain Which are too intrince t’unloose; smooth every passion That in the natures of their lords rebel; Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods; Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks With every gale and vary of their masters, Knowing naught, like dogs, but following. A plague upon your epileptic visage! Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool? Goose, if I had you upon Sarum plain, I’d drive ye cackling home to Camelot.  CORNWALL. What, art thou mad, old fellow?  GLOUCESTER. How fell you out? Say that.  KENT. No contraries hold more antipathy Than I and such a knave.  CORNWALL. Why dost thou call him knave? What is his fault?  KENT. His countenance likes me not.  CORNWALL. No more perchance does mine, or his, or hers.  KENT. Sir, ’tis my occupation to be plain: I have seen better faces in my time Than stands on any shoulder that I see Before me at this instant.  CORNWALL. This is some fellow Who, having been prais’d for bluntness, doth affect A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb Quite from his nature: he cannot flatter, he, An honest mind and plain, he must speak truth! An they will take it, so; if not, he’s plain. These kind of knaves I know which in this plainness Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends Than twenty silly-ducking observants That stretch their duties nicely.  KENT. Sir, in good faith, in sincere verity, Under th’allowance of your great aspect, Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire On flickering Phoebus’ front,—  CORNWALL. What mean’st by this?  KENT. To go out of my dialect, which you discommend so much. I know, sir, I am no flatterer: he that beguiled you in a plain accent was a plain knave; which, for my part, I will not be, though I should win your displeasure to entreat me to’t.  CORNWALL. What was the offence you gave him?  OSWALD. I never gave him any: It pleas’d the King his master very late To strike at me, upon his misconstruction; When he, compact, and flattering his displeasure, Tripp’d me behind; being down, insulted, rail’d And put upon him such a deal of man, That worthied him, got praises of the King For him attempting who was self-subdu’d; And, in the fleshment of this dread exploit, Drew on me here again.  KENT. None of these rogues and cowards But Ajax is their fool.  CORNWALL. Fetch forth the stocks! You stubborn ancient knave, you reverent braggart, We’ll teach you.  KENT. Sir, I am too old to learn: Call not your stocks for me: I serve the King; On whose employment I was sent to you: You shall do small respect, show too bold malice Against the grace and person of my master, Stocking his messenger.  CORNWALL. Fetch forth the stocks! As I have life and honour, there shall he sit till noon.  REGAN. Till noon! Till night, my lord; and all night too!  KENT. Why, madam, if I were your father’s dog, You should not use me so.  REGAN. Sir, being his knave, I will.   [_Stocks brought out._]  CORNWALL. This is a fellow of the selfsame colour Our sister speaks of. Come, bring away the stocks!  GLOUCESTER. Let me beseech your grace not to do so: His fault is much, and the good King his master Will check him for’t: your purpos’d low correction Is such as basest and contemned’st wretches For pilferings and most common trespasses, Are punish’d with. The King must take it ill That he, so slightly valued in his messenger, Should have him thus restrained.  CORNWALL. I’ll answer that.  REGAN. My sister may receive it much more worse, To have her gentleman abus’d, assaulted, For following her affairs. Put in his legs.   [_Kent is put in the stocks._]  CORNWALL. Come, my good lord, away.   [_Exeunt all but Gloucester and Kent._]  GLOUCESTER. I am sorry for thee, friend; ’tis the Duke’s pleasure, Whose disposition, all the world well knows, Will not be rubb’d nor stopp’d; I’ll entreat for thee.  KENT. Pray do not, sir: I have watch’d, and travell’d hard; Some time I shall sleep out, the rest I’ll whistle. A good man’s fortune may grow out at heels: Give you good morrow!  GLOUCESTER. The Duke’s to blame in this: ’twill be ill taken.   [_Exit._]  KENT. Good King, that must approve the common saw, Thou out of heaven’s benediction com’st To the warm sun. Approach, thou beacon to this under globe, That by thy comfortable beams I may Peruse this letter. Nothing almost sees miracles But misery. I know ’tis from Cordelia, Who hath most fortunately been inform’d Of my obscured course. And shall find time From this enormous state, seeking to give Losses their remedies. All weary and o’erwatch’d, Take vantage, heavy eyes, not to behold This shameful lodging. Fortune, good night: smile once more, turn thy wheel!   [_He sleeps._]  SCENE III. The open Country   Enter Edgar.  EDGAR. I heard myself proclaim’d, And by the happy hollow of a tree Escap’d the hunt. No port is free, no place That guard and most unusual vigilance Does not attend my taking. While I may scape I will preserve myself: and am bethought To take the basest and most poorest shape That ever penury in contempt of man, Brought near to beast: my face I’ll grime with filth, Blanket my loins; elf all my hair in knots, And with presented nakedness outface The winds and persecutions of the sky. The country gives me proof and precedent Of Bedlam beggars, who, with roaring voices, Strike in their numb’d and mortified bare arms Pins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary; And with this horrible object, from low farms, Poor pelting villages, sheep-cotes, and mills, Sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers, Enforce their charity. Poor Turlygod! poor Tom, That’s something yet: Edgar I nothing am.   [_Exit._]  SCENE IV. Before Gloucester’s Castle; Kent in the stocks   Enter Lear, Fool and Gentleman.  LEAR. ’Tis strange that they should so depart from home, And not send back my messenger.  GENTLEMAN. As I learn’d, The night before there was no purpose in them Of this remove.  KENT. Hail to thee, noble master!  LEAR. Ha! Mak’st thou this shame thy pastime?  KENT. No, my lord.  FOOL. Ha, ha! he wears cruel garters. Horses are tied by the heads; dogs and bears by the neck, monkeys by the loins, and men by the legs: when a man is overlusty at legs, then he wears wooden nether-stocks.  LEAR. What’s he that hath so much thy place mistook To set thee here?  KENT. It is both he and she, Your son and daughter.  LEAR. No.  KENT. Yes.  LEAR. No, I say.  KENT. I say, yea.  LEAR. No, no; they would not.  KENT. Yes, they have.  LEAR. By Jupiter, I swear no.  KENT. By Juno, I swear ay.  LEAR. They durst not do’t. They could not, would not do’t; ’tis worse than murder, To do upon respect such violent outrage: Resolve me, with all modest haste, which way Thou mightst deserve or they impose this usage, Coming from us.  KENT. My lord, when at their home I did commend your highness’ letters to them, Ere I was risen from the place that show’d My duty kneeling, came there a reeking post, Stew’d in his haste, half breathless, panting forth From Goneril his mistress salutations; Deliver’d letters, spite of intermission, Which presently they read; on those contents, They summon’d up their meiny, straight took horse; Commanded me to follow and attend The leisure of their answer; gave me cold looks: And meeting here the other messenger, Whose welcome I perceiv’d had poison’d mine, Being the very fellow which of late Display’d so saucily against your highness, Having more man than wit about me, drew; He rais’d the house with loud and coward cries. Your son and daughter found this trespass worth The shame which here it suffers.  FOOL. Winter’s not gone yet, if the wild geese fly that way.   Fathers that wear rags     Do make their children blind,   But fathers that bear bags     Shall see their children kind.   Fortune, that arrant whore,   Ne’er turns the key to th’ poor. But for all this, thou shalt have as many dolours for thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year.  LEAR. O, how this mother swells up toward my heart! _Hysterica passio_, down, thou climbing sorrow, Thy element’s below! Where is this daughter?  KENT. With the earl, sir, here within.  LEAR. Follow me not; stay here.   [_Exit._]  GENTLEMAN. Made you no more offence but what you speak of?  KENT. None. How chance the King comes with so small a number?  FOOL. An thou hadst been set i’ the stocks for that question, thou hadst well deserved it.  KENT. Why, fool?  FOOL. We’ll set thee to school to an ant, to teach thee there’s no labouring i’the winter. All that follow their noses are led by their eyes but blind men; and there’s not a nose among twenty but can smell him that’s stinking. Let go thy hold when a great wheel runs down a hill, lest it break thy neck with following it; but the great one that goes upward, let him draw thee after. When a wise man gives thee better counsel, give me mine again: I would have none but knaves follow it, since a fool gives it.           That sir which serves and seeks for gain,              And follows but for form,           Will pack when it begins to rain,              And leave thee in the storm.           But I will tarry; the fool will stay,              And let the wise man fly:           The knave turns fool that runs away;              The fool no knave perdy.       KENT. Where learn’d you this, fool?  FOOL. Not i’ the stocks, fool.   Enter Lear and Gloucester.  LEAR. Deny to speak with me? They are sick? they are weary? They have travell’d all the night? Mere fetches; The images of revolt and flying off. Fetch me a better answer.  GLOUCESTER. My dear lord, You know the fiery quality of the Duke; How unremovable and fix’d he is In his own course.  LEAR. Vengeance! plague! death! confusion! Fiery? What quality? Why, Gloucester, Gloucester, I’d speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.  GLOUCESTER. Well, my good lord, I have inform’d them so.  LEAR. Inform’d them! Dost thou understand me, man?  GLOUCESTER. Ay, my good lord.  LEAR. The King would speak with Cornwall; the dear father Would with his daughter speak, commands, tends, service, Are they inform’d of this? My breath and blood! Fiery? The fiery Duke, tell the hot Duke that— No, but not yet: maybe he is not well: Infirmity doth still neglect all office Whereto our health is bound: we are not ourselves When nature, being oppress’d, commands the mind To suffer with the body: I’ll forbear; And am fallen out with my more headier will, To take the indispos’d and sickly fit For the sound man. [_Looking on Kent._] Death on my state! Wherefore Should he sit here? This act persuades me That this remotion of the Duke and her Is practice only. Give me my servant forth. Go tell the Duke and’s wife I’d speak with them, Now, presently: bid them come forth and hear me, Or at their chamber door I’ll beat the drum Till it cry sleep to death.  GLOUCESTER. I would have all well betwixt you.   [_Exit._]  LEAR. O me, my heart, my rising heart! But down!  FOOL. Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the eels when she put ’em i’ the paste alive; she knapped ’em o’ the coxcombs with a stick and cried ‘Down, wantons, down!’ ’Twas her brother that, in pure kindness to his horse buttered his hay.   Enter Cornwall, Regan, Gloucester and Servants.  LEAR. Good morrow to you both.  CORNWALL. Hail to your grace!   [_Kent here set at liberty._]  REGAN. I am glad to see your highness.  LEAR. Regan, I think you are; I know what reason I have to think so: if thou shouldst not be glad, I would divorce me from thy mother’s tomb, Sepulchring an adultress. [_To Kent_] O, are you free? Some other time for that.—Beloved Regan, Thy sister’s naught: O Regan, she hath tied Sharp-tooth’d unkindness, like a vulture, here.   [_Points to his heart._]  I can scarce speak to thee; thou’lt not believe With how deprav’d a quality—O Regan!  REGAN. I pray you, sir, take patience. I have hope You less know how to value her desert Than she to scant her duty.  LEAR. Say, how is that?  REGAN. I cannot think my sister in the least Would fail her obligation. If, sir, perchance She have restrain’d the riots of your followers, ’Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end, As clears her from all blame.  LEAR. My curses on her.  REGAN. O, sir, you are old; Nature in you stands on the very verge Of her confine: you should be rul’d and led By some discretion, that discerns your state Better than you yourself. Therefore I pray you, That to our sister you do make return; Say you have wrong’d her, sir.  LEAR. Ask her forgiveness? Do you but mark how this becomes the house? ‘Dear daughter, I confess that I am old; [_Kneeling._] Age is unnecessary: on my knees I beg That you’ll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.’  REGAN. Good sir, no more! These are unsightly tricks: Return you to my sister.  LEAR. [_Rising._] Never, Regan: She hath abated me of half my train; Look’d black upon me; struck me with her tongue, Most serpent-like, upon the very heart. All the stor’d vengeances of heaven fall On her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones, You taking airs, with lameness!  CORNWALL. Fie, sir, fie!  LEAR. You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames Into her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty, You fen-suck’d fogs, drawn by the powerful sun, To fall and blast her pride!  REGAN. O the blest gods! So will you wish on me when the rash mood is on.  LEAR. No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse. Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give Thee o’er to harshness. Her eyes are fierce; but thine Do comfort, and not burn. ’Tis not in thee To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train, To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes, And, in conclusion, to oppose the bolt Against my coming in. Thou better know’st The offices of nature, bond of childhood, Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude; Thy half o’ the kingdom hast thou not forgot, Wherein I thee endow’d.  REGAN. Good sir, to the purpose.  LEAR. Who put my man i’ the stocks?   [_Tucket within._]  CORNWALL. What trumpet’s that?  REGAN. I know’t, my sister’s: this approves her letter, That she would soon be here.   Enter Oswald.  Is your lady come?  LEAR. This is a slave, whose easy borrowed pride Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows. Out, varlet, from my sight!  CORNWALL. What means your grace?  LEAR. Who stock’d my servant? Regan, I have good hope Thou didst not know on’t. Who comes here? O heavens!   Enter Goneril.  If you do love old men, if your sweet sway Allow obedience, if yourselves are old, Make it your cause; send down, and take my part! [_To Goneril._] Art not asham’d to look upon this beard? O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand?  GONERIL. Why not by the hand, sir? How have I offended? All’s not offence that indiscretion finds And dotage terms so.  LEAR. O sides, you are too tough! Will you yet hold? How came my man i’ the stocks?  CORNWALL. I set him there, sir: but his own disorders Deserv’d much less advancement.  LEAR. You? Did you?  REGAN. I pray you, father, being weak, seem so. If, till the expiration of your month, You will return and sojourn with my sister, Dismissing half your train, come then to me: I am now from home, and out of that provision Which shall be needful for your entertainment.  LEAR. Return to her, and fifty men dismiss’d? No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose To wage against the enmity o’ the air; To be a comrade with the wolf and owl, Necessity’s sharp pinch! Return with her? Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took Our youngest born, I could as well be brought To knee his throne, and, squire-like, pension beg To keep base life afoot. Return with her? Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter To this detested groom.   [_Pointing to Oswald._]  GONERIL. At your choice, sir.  LEAR. I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad: I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell: We’ll no more meet, no more see one another. But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter; Or rather a disease that’s in my flesh, Which I must needs call mine. Thou art a boil, A plague sore, or embossed carbuncle In my corrupted blood. But I’ll not chide thee; Let shame come when it will, I do not call it: I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot, Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove: Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure: I can be patient; I can stay with Regan, I and my hundred knights.  REGAN. Not altogether so, I look’d not for you yet, nor am provided For your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister; For those that mingle reason with your passion Must be content to think you old, and so— But she knows what she does.  LEAR. Is this well spoken?  REGAN. I dare avouch it, sir: what, fifty followers? Is it not well? What should you need of more? Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger Speak ’gainst so great a number? How in one house Should many people, under two commands, Hold amity? ’Tis hard; almost impossible.  GONERIL. Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance From those that she calls servants, or from mine?  REGAN. Why not, my lord? If then they chanc’d to slack ye, We could control them. If you will come to me,— For now I spy a danger,—I entreat you To bring but five-and-twenty: to no more Will I give place or notice.  LEAR. I gave you all,—  REGAN. And in good time you gave it.  LEAR. Made you my guardians, my depositaries; But kept a reservation to be followed With such a number. What, must I come to you With five-and-twenty, Regan, said you so?  REGAN. And speak’t again my lord; no more with me.  LEAR. Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour’d When others are more wicked; not being the worst Stands in some rank of praise. [_To Goneril._] I’ll go with thee: Thy fifty yet doth double five-and-twenty, And thou art twice her love.  GONERIL. Hear me, my lord: What need you five-and-twenty? Ten? Or five? To follow in a house where twice so many Have a command to tend you?  REGAN. What need one?  LEAR. O, reason not the need: our basest beggars Are in the poorest thing superfluous: Allow not nature more than nature needs, Man’s life is cheap as beast’s. Thou art a lady; If only to go warm were gorgeous, Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear’st Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need,— You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need! You see me here, you gods, a poor old man, As full of grief as age; wretched in both! If it be you that stirs these daughters’ hearts Against their father, fool me not so much To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger, And let not women’s weapons, water-drops, Stain my man’s cheeks! No, you unnatural hags, I will have such revenges on you both That all the world shall,—I will do such things,— What they are yet, I know not; but they shall be The terrors of the earth. You think I’ll weep; No, I’ll not weep:— [_Storm and tempest._] I have full cause of weeping; but this heart Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws Or ere I’ll weep.—O fool, I shall go mad!   [_Exeunt Lear, Gloucester, Kent and Fool._]  CORNWALL. Let us withdraw; ’twill be a storm.  REGAN. This house is little: the old man and his people Cannot be well bestow’d.  GONERIL. ’Tis his own blame; hath put himself from rest And must needs taste his folly.  REGAN. For his particular, I’ll receive him gladly, But not one follower.  GONERIL. So am I purpos’d. Where is my lord of Gloucester?   Enter Gloucester.  CORNWALL. Followed the old man forth, he is return’d.  GLOUCESTER. The King is in high rage.  CORNWALL. Whither is he going?  GLOUCESTER. He calls to horse; but will I know not whither.  CORNWALL. ’Tis best to give him way; he leads himself.  GONERIL. My lord, entreat him by no means to stay.  GLOUCESTER. Alack, the night comes on, and the high winds Do sorely ruffle; for many miles about There’s scarce a bush.  REGAN. O, sir, to wilful men The injuries that they themselves procure Must be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors. He is attended with a desperate train, And what they may incense him to, being apt To have his ear abus’d, wisdom bids fear.  CORNWALL. Shut up your doors, my lord; ’tis a wild night. My Regan counsels well: come out o’ the storm.   [_Exeunt._]
  ACT III  SCENE I. A Heath
 A storm with thunder and lightning. Enter Kent and a Gentleman, severally.  KENT. Who’s there, besides foul weather?  GENTLEMAN. One minded like the weather, most unquietly.  KENT. I know you. Where’s the King?  GENTLEMAN. Contending with the fretful elements; Bids the wind blow the earth into the sea, Or swell the curled waters ’bove the main, That things might change or cease; tears his white hair, Which the impetuous blasts with eyeless rage, Catch in their fury and make nothing of; Strives in his little world of man to outscorn The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain. This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch, The lion and the belly-pinched wolf Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs, And bids what will take all.  KENT. But who is with him?  GENTLEMAN. None but the fool, who labours to out-jest His heart-struck injuries.  KENT. Sir, I do know you; And dare, upon the warrant of my note Commend a dear thing to you. There is division, Although as yet the face of it be cover’d With mutual cunning, ’twixt Albany and Cornwall; Who have, as who have not, that their great stars Throne’d and set high; servants, who seem no less, Which are to France the spies and speculations Intelligent of our state. What hath been seen, Either in snuffs and packings of the Dukes; Or the hard rein which both of them have borne Against the old kind King; or something deeper, Whereof, perchance, these are but furnishings;— But, true it is, from France there comes a power Into this scatter’d kingdom; who already, Wise in our negligence, have secret feet In some of our best ports, and are at point To show their open banner.—Now to you: If on my credit you dare build so far To make your speed to Dover, you shall find Some that will thank you making just report Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow The King hath cause to plain. I am a gentleman of blood and breeding; And from some knowledge and assurance Offer this office to you.  GENTLEMAN. I will talk further with you.  KENT. No, do not. For confirmation that I am much more Than my out-wall, open this purse, and take What it contains. If you shall see Cordelia, As fear not but you shall, show her this ring; And she will tell you who your fellow is That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm! I will go seek the King.  GENTLEMAN. Give me your hand: have you no more to say?  KENT. Few words, but, to effect, more than all yet: That, when we have found the King, in which your pain That way, I’ll this; he that first lights on him Holla the other.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. Another part of the heath   Storm continues. Enter Lear and Fool.  LEAR. Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! Rage! blow! You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout Till you have drench’d our steeples, drown’d the cocks! You sulphurous and thought-executing fires, Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts, Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder, Strike flat the thick rotundity o’ the world! Crack nature’s moulds, all germens spill at once, That make ingrateful man!  FOOL. O nuncle, court holy-water in a dry house is better than this rain-water out o’ door. Good nuncle, in; and ask thy daughters blessing: here’s a night pities neither wise men nor fools.  LEAR. Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! spout, rain! Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire are my daughters; I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness. I never gave you kingdom, call’d you children; You owe me no subscription: then let fall Your horrible pleasure. Here I stand your slave, A poor, infirm, weak, and despis’d old man: But yet I call you servile ministers, That will with two pernicious daughters join Your high-engender’d battles ’gainst a head So old and white as this! O! O! ’tis foul!  FOOL. He that has a house to put’s head in has a good head-piece.    The codpiece that will house      Before the head has any,    The head and he shall louse:      So beggars marry many.    The man that makes his toe      What he his heart should make    Shall of a corn cry woe,      And turn his sleep to wake. For there was never yet fair woman but she made mouths in a glass.  LEAR. No, I will be the pattern of all patience; I will say nothing.   Enter Kent.  KENT. Who’s there?  FOOL. Marry, here’s grace and a codpiece; that’s a wise man and a fool.  KENT. Alas, sir, are you here? Things that love night Love not such nights as these; the wrathful skies Gallow the very wanderers of the dark, And make them keep their caves. Since I was man, Such sheets of fire, such bursts of horrid thunder, Such groans of roaring wind and rain I never Remember to have heard. Man’s nature cannot carry Th’affliction, nor the fear.  LEAR. Let the great gods, That keep this dreadful pudder o’er our heads, Find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch, That hast within thee undivulged crimes Unwhipp’d of justice. Hide thee, thou bloody hand; Thou perjur’d, and thou simular of virtue That art incestuous. Caitiff, to pieces shake That under covert and convenient seeming Hast practis’d on man’s life: close pent-up guilts, Rive your concealing continents, and cry These dreadful summoners grace. I am a man More sinn’d against than sinning.  KENT. Alack, bareheaded! Gracious my lord, hard by here is a hovel; Some friendship will it lend you ’gainst the tempest: Repose you there, whilst I to this hard house,— More harder than the stones whereof ’tis rais’d; Which even but now, demanding after you, Denied me to come in,—return, and force Their scanted courtesy.  LEAR. My wits begin to turn. Come on, my boy. How dost, my boy? Art cold? I am cold myself. Where is this straw, my fellow? The art of our necessities is strange, That can make vile things precious. Come, your hovel. Poor fool and knave, I have one part in my heart That’s sorry yet for thee.  FOOL. [_Singing._]    He that has and a little tiny wit,      With heigh-ho, the wind and the rain,    Must make content with his fortunes fit,      Though the rain it raineth every day.  LEAR. True, boy. Come, bring us to this hovel.   [_Exeunt Lear and Kent._]  FOOL. This is a brave night to cool a courtezan. I’ll speak a prophecy ere I go:    When priests are more in word than matter;    When brewers mar their malt with water;    When nobles are their tailors’ tutors;    No heretics burn’d, but wenches’ suitors;    When every case in law is right;    No squire in debt, nor no poor knight;    When slanders do not live in tongues;    Nor cut-purses come not to throngs;    When usurers tell their gold i’ the field;    And bawds and whores do churches build,    Then shall the realm of Albion    Come to great confusion:    Then comes the time, who lives to see’t,    That going shall be us’d with feet. This prophecy Merlin shall make; for I live before his time.   [_Exit._]  SCENE III. A Room in Gloucester’s Castle   Enter Gloucester and Edmund.  GLOUCESTER. Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this unnatural dealing. When I desired their leave that I might pity him, they took from me the use of mine own house; charged me on pain of perpetual displeasure, neither to speak of him, entreat for him, or any way sustain him.  EDMUND. Most savage and unnatural!  GLOUCESTER. Go to; say you nothing. There is division between the Dukes, and a worse matter than that: I have received a letter this night;—’tis dangerous to be spoken;—I have locked the letter in my closet: these injuries the King now bears will be revenged home; there’s part of a power already footed: we must incline to the King. I will look him, and privily relieve him: go you and maintain talk with the Duke, that my charity be not of him perceived: if he ask for me, I am ill, and gone to bed. If I die for it, as no less is threatened me, the King my old master must be relieved. There is some strange thing toward, Edmund; pray you be careful.   [_Exit._]  EDMUND. This courtesy, forbid thee, shall the Duke Instantly know; and of that letter too. This seems a fair deserving, and must draw me That which my father loses, no less than all: The younger rises when the old doth fall.   [_Exit._]  SCENE IV. A part of the Heath with a Hovel   Storm continues. Enter Lear, Kent and Fool.  KENT. Here is the place, my lord; good my lord, enter: The tyranny of the open night’s too rough For nature to endure.  LEAR. Let me alone.  KENT. Good my lord, enter here.  LEAR. Wilt break my heart?  KENT. I had rather break mine own. Good my lord, enter.  LEAR. Thou think’st ’tis much that this contentious storm Invades us to the skin: so ’tis to thee, But where the greater malady is fix’d, The lesser is scarce felt. Thou’dst shun a bear; But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea, Thou’dst meet the bear i’ the mouth. When the mind’s free, The body’s delicate: the tempest in my mind Doth from my senses take all feeling else Save what beats there. Filial ingratitude! Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand For lifting food to’t? But I will punish home; No, I will weep no more. In such a night To shut me out! Pour on; I will endure: In such a night as this! O Regan, Goneril! Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave all, O, that way madness lies; let me shun that; No more of that.  KENT. Good my lord, enter here.  LEAR. Prithee go in thyself; seek thine own ease: This tempest will not give me leave to ponder On things would hurt me more. But I’ll go in. [_To the Fool._] In, boy; go first. You houseless poverty, Nay, get thee in. I’ll pray, and then I’ll sleep.   [_Fool goes in._]  Poor naked wretches, wheresoe’er you are, That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm, How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides, Your loop’d and window’d raggedness, defend you From seasons such as these? O, I have ta’en Too little care of this! Take physic, pomp; Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel, That thou mayst shake the superflux to them And show the heavens more just.  EDGAR. [_Within._] Fathom and half, fathom and half! Poor Tom!   [_The Fool runs out from the hovel._]  FOOL. Come not in here, nuncle, here’s a spirit. Help me, help me!  KENT. Give me thy hand. Who’s there?  FOOL. A spirit, a spirit: he says his name’s poor Tom.  KENT. What art thou that dost grumble there i’ the straw? Come forth.   Enter Edgar, disguised as a madman.  EDGAR. Away! the foul fiend follows me! Through the sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind. Humh! go to thy cold bed, and warm thee.  LEAR. Didst thou give all to thy two daughters? And art thou come to this?  EDGAR. Who gives anything to poor Tom? Whom the foul fiend hath led through fire and through flame, through ford and whirlpool, o’er bog and quagmire; that hath laid knives under his pillow and halters in his pew, set ratsbane by his porridge; made him proud of heart, to ride on a bay trotting horse over four-inched bridges, to course his own shadow for a traitor. Bless thy five wits! 	Tom’s a-cold. O, do, de, do, de, do, de. Bless thee from whirlwinds, star-blasting, and taking! Do poor Tom some charity, whom the foul fiend vexes. There could I have him now, and there,—and there again, and there.   [_Storm continues._]  LEAR. What, have his daughters brought him to this pass? Couldst thou save nothing? Didst thou give ’em all?  FOOL. Nay, he reserv’d a blanket, else we had been all shamed.  LEAR. Now all the plagues that in the pendulous air Hang fated o’er men’s faults light on thy daughters!  KENT. He hath no daughters, sir.  LEAR. Death, traitor! nothing could have subdu’d nature To such a lowness but his unkind daughters. Is it the fashion that discarded fathers Should have thus little mercy on their flesh? Judicious punishment! ’twas this flesh begot Those pelican daughters.  EDGAR.    Pillicock sat on Pillicock hill,      Alow, alow, loo loo!  FOOL. This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen.  EDGAR. Take heed o’ th’ foul fiend: obey thy parents; keep thy word justly; swear not; commit not with man’s sworn spouse; set not thy sweet-heart on proud array. Tom’s a-cold.  LEAR. What hast thou been?  EDGAR. A serving-man, proud in heart and mind; that curled my hair; wore gloves in my cap; served the lust of my mistress’ heart, and did the act of darkness with her; swore as many oaths as I spake words, and broke them in the sweet face of heaven. One that slept in the contriving of lust, and waked to do it. Wine loved I deeply, dice dearly; and in woman out-paramour’d the Turk. False of heart, light of ear, bloody of hand; hog in sloth, fox in stealth, wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in prey. Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of silks betray thy poor heart to woman. Keep thy foot out of brothels, thy hand out of plackets, thy pen from lender’s book, and defy the foul fiend. Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind: says suum, mun, nonny. Dolphin my boy, boy, sessa! let him trot by.   [_Storm still continues._]  LEAR. Why, thou wert better in thy grave than to answer with thy uncovered body this extremity of the skies. Is man no more than this? Consider him well. Thou owest the worm no silk, the beast no hide, the sheep no wool, the cat no perfume. Ha! here’s three on’s are sophisticated! Thou art the thing itself: unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor, bare, forked animal as thou art. Off, off, you lendings! Come, unbutton here.   [_Tears off his clothes._]  FOOL. Prithee, nuncle, be contented; ’tis a naughty night to swim in. Now a little fire in a wild field were like an old lecher’s heart, a small spark, all the rest on’s body cold. Look, here comes a walking fire.  EDGAR. This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet: he begins at curfew, and walks till the first cock; he gives the web and the pin, squints the eye, and makes the harelip; mildews the white wheat, and hurts the poor creature of earth.    Swithold footed thrice the old;    He met the nightmare, and her nine-fold;      Bid her alight and her troth plight,    And aroint thee, witch, aroint thee!  KENT. How fares your grace?   Enter Gloucester with a torch.  LEAR. What’s he?  KENT. Who’s there? What is’t you seek?  GLOUCESTER. What are you there? Your names?  EDGAR. Poor Tom; that eats the swimming frog, the toad, the todpole, the wall-newt and the water; that in the fury of his heart, when the foul fiend rages, eats cow-dung for sallets; swallows the old rat and the ditch-dog; drinks the green mantle of the standing pool; who is whipped from tithing to tithing, and stocked, punished, and imprisoned; who hath had three suits to his back, six shirts to his body,      Horse to ride, and weapon to wear.      But mice and rats and such small deer,      Have been Tom’s food for seven long year. Beware my follower. Peace, Smulkin; peace, thou fiend!  GLOUCESTER. What, hath your grace no better company?  EDGAR. The prince of darkness is a gentleman: Modo he’s call’d, and Mahu.  GLOUCESTER. Our flesh and blood, my lord, is grown so vile That it doth hate what gets it.  EDGAR. Poor Tom’s a-cold.  GLOUCESTER. Go in with me: my duty cannot suffer T’obey in all your daughters’ hard commands; Though their injunction be to bar my doors, And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you, Yet have I ventur’d to come seek you out, And bring you where both fire and food is ready.  LEAR. First let me talk with this philosopher. What is the cause of thunder?  KENT. Good my lord, take his offer; go into the house.  LEAR. I’ll talk a word with this same learned Theban. What is your study?  EDGAR. How to prevent the fiend and to kill vermin.  LEAR. Let me ask you one word in private.  KENT. Importune him once more to go, my lord; His wits begin t’unsettle.  GLOUCESTER. Canst thou blame him? His daughters seek his death. Ah, that good Kent! He said it would be thus, poor banish’d man! Thou sayest the King grows mad; I’ll tell thee, friend, I am almost mad myself. I had a son, Now outlaw’d from my blood; he sought my life But lately, very late: I lov’d him, friend, No father his son dearer: true to tell thee,   [_Storm continues._]  The grief hath craz’d my wits. What a night’s this! I do beseech your grace.  LEAR. O, cry you mercy, sir. Noble philosopher, your company.  EDGAR. Tom’s a-cold.  GLOUCESTER. In, fellow, there, into the hovel; keep thee warm.  LEAR. Come, let’s in all.  KENT. This way, my lord.  LEAR. With him; I will keep still with my philosopher.  KENT. Good my lord, soothe him; let him take the fellow.  GLOUCESTER. Take him you on.  KENT. Sirrah, come on; go along with us.  LEAR. Come, good Athenian.  GLOUCESTER. No words, no words, hush.  EDGAR.    Child Rowland to the dark tower came,    His word was still—Fie, foh, and fum,    I smell the blood of a British man.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE V. A Room in Gloucester’s Castle   Enter Cornwall and Edmund.  CORNWALL. I will have my revenge ere I depart his house.  EDMUND. How, my lord, I may be censured, that nature thus gives way to loyalty, something fears me to think of.  CORNWALL. I now perceive it was not altogether your brother’s evil disposition made him seek his death; but a provoking merit, set a-work by a reproveable badness in himself.  EDMUND. How malicious is my fortune, that I must repent to be just! This is the letter he spoke of, which approves him an intelligent party to the advantages of France. O heavens! that this treason were not; or not I the detector!  CORNWALL. Go with me to the Duchess.  EDMUND. If the matter of this paper be certain, you have mighty business in hand.  CORNWALL. True or false, it hath made thee Earl of Gloucester. Seek out where thy father is, that he may be ready for our apprehension.  EDMUND. [_Aside._] If I find him comforting the King, it will stuff his suspicion more fully. I will persever in my course of loyalty, though the conflict be sore between that and my blood.  CORNWALL. I will lay trust upon thee; and thou shalt find a dearer father in my love.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE VI. A Chamber in a Farmhouse adjoining the Castle   Enter Gloucester, Lear, Kent, Fool and Edgar.  GLOUCESTER. Here is better than the open air; take it thankfully. I will piece out the comfort with what addition I can: I will not be long from you.  KENT. All the power of his wits have given way to his impatience:— the gods reward your kindness!   [_Exit Gloucester._]  EDGAR. Frateretto calls me; and tells me Nero is an angler in the lake of darkness. Pray, innocent, and beware the foul fiend.  FOOL. Prithee, nuncle, tell me whether a madman be a gentleman or a yeoman.  LEAR. A king, a king!  FOOL. No, he’s a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son; for he’s a mad yeoman that sees his son a gentleman before him.  LEAR. To have a thousand with red burning spits Come hissing in upon ’em.  EDGAR. The foul fiend bites my back.  FOOL. He’s mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf, a horse’s health, a boy’s love, or a whore’s oath.  LEAR. It shall be done; I will arraign them straight. [_To Edgar._] Come, sit thou here, most learned justicer; [_To the Fool._] Thou, sapient sir, sit here. Now, you she-foxes!—  EDGAR. Look, where he stands and glares! Want’st thou eyes at trial, madam?   Come o’er the bourn, Bessy, to me.  FOOL.    Her boat hath a leak,    And she must not speak    Why she dares not come over to thee.  EDGAR. The foul fiend haunts poor Tom in the voice of a nightingale. Hoppedance cries in Tom’s belly for two white herring. Croak not, black angel; I have no food for thee.  KENT. How do you, sir? Stand you not so amaz’d; Will you lie down and rest upon the cushions?  LEAR. I’ll see their trial first. Bring in their evidence. [_To Edgar._] Thou, robed man of justice, take thy place. [_To the Fool._] And thou, his yokefellow of equity, Bench by his side. [_To Kent._] You are o’ the commission, Sit you too.  EDGAR.    Let us deal justly.    Sleepest or wakest thou, jolly shepherd?      Thy sheep be in the corn;    And for one blast of thy minikin mouth      Thy sheep shall take no harm. Purr! the cat is grey.  LEAR. Arraign her first; ’tis Goneril. I here take my oath before this honourable assembly, she kicked the poor King her father.  FOOL. Come hither, mistress. Is your name Goneril?  LEAR. She cannot deny it.  FOOL. Cry you mercy, I took you for a joint-stool.  LEAR. And here’s another, whose warp’d looks proclaim What store her heart is made on. Stop her there! Arms, arms! sword! fire! Corruption in the place! False justicer, why hast thou let her ’scape?  EDGAR. Bless thy five wits!  KENT. O pity! Sir, where is the patience now That you so oft have boasted to retain?  EDGAR. [_Aside._] My tears begin to take his part so much They mar my counterfeiting.  LEAR. The little dogs and all, Trey, Blanch, and Sweetheart, see, they bark at me.  EDGAR. Tom will throw his head at them. Avaunt, you curs!    Be thy mouth or black or white,    Tooth that poisons if it bite;    Mastiff, greyhound, mongrel grim,    Hound or spaniel, brach or him,    Or bobtail tike or trundle-tail,    Tom will make them weep and wail;    For, with throwing thus my head,    Dogs leap the hatch, and all are fled. Do, de, de, de. Sessa! Come, march to wakes and fairs and market towns. Poor Tom, thy horn is dry.  LEAR. Then let them anatomize Regan; see what breeds about her heart. Is there any cause in nature that makes these hard hearts? [_To Edgar._] You, sir, I entertain you for one of my hundred; only I do not like the fashion of your garments. You’ll say they are Persian; but let them be changed.  KENT. Now, good my lord, lie here and rest awhile.  LEAR. Make no noise, make no noise; draw the curtains. So, so. We’ll go to supper i’ the morning.  FOOL. And I’ll go to bed at noon.   Enter Gloucester.  GLOUCESTER. Come hither, friend; Where is the King my master?  KENT. Here, sir; but trouble him not, his wits are gone.  GLOUCESTER. Good friend, I prithee, take him in thy arms; I have o’erheard a plot of death upon him; There is a litter ready; lay him in’t And drive towards Dover, friend, where thou shalt meet Both welcome and protection. Take up thy master; If thou shouldst dally half an hour, his life, With thine, and all that offer to defend him, Stand in assured loss. Take up, take up; And follow me, that will to some provision Give thee quick conduct.  KENT. Oppressed nature sleeps. This rest might yet have balm’d thy broken sinews, Which, if convenience will not allow, Stand in hard cure. Come, help to bear thy master; [_To the Fool._] Thou must not stay behind.  GLOUCESTER. Come, come, away!   [_Exeunt Kent, Gloucester and the Fool bearing off Lear._]  EDGAR. When we our betters see bearing our woes, We scarcely think our miseries our foes. Who alone suffers, suffers most i’ the mind, Leaving free things and happy shows behind: But then the mind much sufferance doth o’erskip When grief hath mates, and bearing fellowship. How light and portable my pain seems now, When that which makes me bend makes the King bow; He childed as I fathered! Tom, away! Mark the high noises; and thyself bewray, When false opinion, whose wrong thoughts defile thee, In thy just proof repeals and reconciles thee. What will hap more tonight, safe ’scape the King! Lurk, lurk.   [_Exit._]  SCENE VII. A Room in Gloucester’s Castle   Enter Cornwall, Regan, Goneril, Edmund and Servants.  CORNWALL. Post speedily to my lord your husband, show him this letter: the army of France is landed. Seek out the traitor Gloucester.   [_Exeunt some of the Servants._]  REGAN. Hang him instantly.  GONERIL. Pluck out his eyes.  CORNWALL. Leave him to my displeasure. Edmund, keep you our sister company: the revenges we are bound to take upon your traitorous father are not fit for your beholding. Advise the Duke where you are going, to a most festinate preparation: we are bound to the like. Our posts shall be swift and intelligent betwixt us. Farewell, dear sister, farewell, my lord of Gloucester.   Enter Oswald.  How now! Where’s the King?  OSWALD. My lord of Gloucester hath convey’d him hence: Some five or six and thirty of his knights, Hot questrists after him, met him at gate; Who, with some other of the lord’s dependants, Are gone with him toward Dover: where they boast To have well-armed friends.  CORNWALL. Get horses for your mistress.  GONERIL. Farewell, sweet lord, and sister.  CORNWALL. Edmund, farewell.   [_Exeunt Goneril, Edmund and Oswald._]  Go seek the traitor Gloucester, Pinion him like a thief, bring him before us.   [_Exeunt other Servants._]  Though well we may not pass upon his life Without the form of justice, yet our power Shall do a courtesy to our wrath, which men May blame, but not control. Who’s there? The traitor?   Enter Gloucester and Servants.  REGAN. Ingrateful fox! ’tis he.  CORNWALL. Bind fast his corky arms.  GLOUCESTER. What mean your graces? Good my friends, consider you are my guests. Do me no foul play, friends.  CORNWALL. Bind him, I say.   [_Servants bind him._]  REGAN. Hard, hard. O filthy traitor!  GLOUCESTER. Unmerciful lady as you are, I’m none.  CORNWALL. To this chair bind him. Villain, thou shalt find—   [_Regan plucks his beard._]  GLOUCESTER. By the kind gods, ’tis most ignobly done To pluck me by the beard.  REGAN. So white, and such a traitor!  GLOUCESTER. Naughty lady, These hairs which thou dost ravish from my chin Will quicken, and accuse thee. I am your host: With robber’s hands my hospitable favours You should not ruffle thus. What will you do?  CORNWALL. Come, sir, what letters had you late from France?  REGAN. Be simple answer’d, for we know the truth.  CORNWALL. And what confederacy have you with the traitors, Late footed in the kingdom?  REGAN. To whose hands have you sent the lunatic King? Speak.  GLOUCESTER. I have a letter guessingly set down, Which came from one that’s of a neutral heart, And not from one oppos’d.  CORNWALL. Cunning.  REGAN. And false.  CORNWALL. Where hast thou sent the King?  GLOUCESTER. To Dover.  REGAN. Wherefore to Dover? Wast thou not charg’d at peril,—  CORNWALL. Wherefore to Dover? Let him first answer that.  GLOUCESTER. I am tied to the stake, and I must stand the course.  REGAN. Wherefore to Dover, sir?  GLOUCESTER. Because I would not see thy cruel nails Pluck out his poor old eyes; nor thy fierce sister In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs. The sea, with such a storm as his bare head In hell-black night endur’d, would have buoy’d up, And quench’d the stelled fires; Yet, poor old heart, he holp the heavens to rain. If wolves had at thy gate howl’d that stern time, Thou shouldst have said, ‘Good porter, turn the key.’ All cruels else subscrib’d: but I shall see The winged vengeance overtake such children.  CORNWALL. See’t shalt thou never. Fellows, hold the chair. Upon these eyes of thine I’ll set my foot.   [_Gloucester is held down in his chair, while Cornwall plucks out one  of his eyes and sets his foot on it._]  GLOUCESTER. He that will think to live till he be old, Give me some help!—O cruel! O you gods!  REGAN. One side will mock another; the other too!  CORNWALL. If you see vengeance—  FIRST SERVANT. Hold your hand, my lord: I have serv’d you ever since I was a child; But better service have I never done you Than now to bid you hold.  REGAN. How now, you dog!  FIRST SERVANT. If you did wear a beard upon your chin, I’d shake it on this quarrel. What do you mean?  CORNWALL. My villain?   [_Draws, and runs at him._]  FIRST SERVANT. Nay, then, come on, and take the chance of anger.   [_Draws. They fight. Cornwall is wounded._]  REGAN. [_To another servant._] Give me thy sword. A peasant stand up thus?   [_Snatches a sword, comes behind, and stabs him._]  FIRST SERVANT. O, I am slain! My lord, you have one eye left To see some mischief on him. O!   [_Dies._]  CORNWALL. Lest it see more, prevent it. Out, vile jelly! Where is thy lustre now?   [_Tears out Gloucester’s other eye and throws it on the ground._]  GLOUCESTER. All dark and comfortless. Where’s my son Edmund? Edmund, enkindle all the sparks of nature To quit this horrid act.  REGAN. Out, treacherous villain! Thou call’st on him that hates thee: it was he That made the overture of thy treasons to us; Who is too good to pity thee.  GLOUCESTER. O my follies! Then Edgar was abus’d. Kind gods, forgive me that, and prosper him!  REGAN. Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell His way to Dover. How is’t, my lord? How look you?  CORNWALL. I have receiv’d a hurt: follow me, lady. Turn out that eyeless villain. Throw this slave Upon the dunghill. Regan, I bleed apace: Untimely comes this hurt: give me your arm.   [_Exit Cornwall, led by Regan; Servants unbind Gloucester and lead  him out._]  SECOND SERVANT. I’ll never care what wickedness I do, If this man come to good.  THIRD SERVANT. If she live long, And in the end meet the old course of death, Women will all turn monsters.  SECOND SERVANT. Let’s follow the old Earl, and get the bedlam To lead him where he would: his roguish madness Allows itself to anything.  THIRD SERVANT. Go thou: I’ll fetch some flax and whites of eggs To apply to his bleeding face. Now heaven help him!   [_Exeunt._]
  ACT IV  SCENE I. The heath
 Enter Edgar.  EDGAR. Yet better thus, and known to be contemn’d, Than still contemn’d and flatter’d. To be worst, The lowest and most dejected thing of fortune, Stands still in esperance, lives not in fear: The lamentable change is from the best; The worst returns to laughter. Welcome then, Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace; The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst Owes nothing to thy blasts.   Enter Gloucester, led by an Old Man.  But who comes here? My father, poorly led? World, world, O world! But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee, Life would not yield to age.  OLD MAN. O my good lord, I have been your tenant, and your father’s tenant these fourscore years.  GLOUCESTER. Away, get thee away; good friend, be gone. Thy comforts can do me no good at all; Thee they may hurt.  OLD MAN. You cannot see your way.  GLOUCESTER. I have no way, and therefore want no eyes; I stumbled when I saw. Full oft ’tis seen Our means secure us, and our mere defects Prove our commodities. O dear son Edgar, The food of thy abused father’s wrath! Might I but live to see thee in my touch, I’d say I had eyes again!  OLD MAN. How now! Who’s there?  EDGAR. [_Aside._] O gods! Who is’t can say ‘I am at the worst’? I am worse than e’er I was.  OLD MAN. ’Tis poor mad Tom.  EDGAR. [_Aside._] And worse I may be yet. The worst is not So long as we can say ‘This is the worst.’  OLD MAN. Fellow, where goest?  GLOUCESTER. Is it a beggar-man?  OLD MAN. Madman, and beggar too.  GLOUCESTER. He has some reason, else he could not beg. I’ the last night’s storm I such a fellow saw; Which made me think a man a worm. My son Came then into my mind, and yet my mind Was then scarce friends with him. I have heard more since. As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods, They kill us for their sport.  EDGAR. [_Aside._] How should this be? Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow, Angering itself and others. Bless thee, master!  GLOUCESTER. Is that the naked fellow?  OLD MAN. Ay, my lord.  GLOUCESTER. Then prithee get thee away. If for my sake Thou wilt o’ertake us hence a mile or twain, I’ the way toward Dover, do it for ancient love, And bring some covering for this naked soul, Which I’ll entreat to lead me.  OLD MAN. Alack, sir, he is mad.  GLOUCESTER. ’Tis the time’s plague when madmen lead the blind. Do as I bid thee, or rather do thy pleasure; Above the rest, be gone.  OLD MAN. I’ll bring him the best ’parel that I have, Come on’t what will.   [_Exit._]  GLOUCESTER. Sirrah naked fellow.  EDGAR. Poor Tom’s a-cold. [_Aside._] I cannot daub it further.  GLOUCESTER. Come hither, fellow.  EDGAR. [_Aside._] And yet I must. Bless thy sweet eyes, they bleed.  GLOUCESTER. Know’st thou the way to Dover?  EDGAR. Both stile and gate, horseway and footpath. Poor Tom hath been scared out of his good wits. Bless thee, good man’s son, from the foul fiend! Five fiends have been in poor Tom at once; of lust, as Obidicut; Hobbididence, prince of darkness; Mahu, of stealing; Modo, of murder; Flibbertigibbet, of mopping and mowing, who since possesses chambermaids and waiting women. So, bless thee, master!  GLOUCESTER. Here, take this purse, thou whom the heaven’s plagues Have humbled to all strokes: that I am wretched Makes thee the happier. Heavens deal so still! Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man, That slaves your ordinance, that will not see Because he does not feel, feel your power quickly; So distribution should undo excess, And each man have enough. Dost thou know Dover?  EDGAR. Ay, master.  GLOUCESTER. There is a cliff, whose high and bending head Looks fearfully in the confined deep: Bring me but to the very brim of it, And I’ll repair the misery thou dost bear With something rich about me: from that place I shall no leading need.  EDGAR. Give me thy arm: Poor Tom shall lead thee.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. Before the Duke of Albany’s Palace   Enter Goneril, Edmund; Oswald meeting them.  GONERIL. Welcome, my lord. I marvel our mild husband Not met us on the way. Now, where’s your master?  OSWALD. Madam, within; but never man so chang’d. I told him of the army that was landed; He smil’d at it: I told him you were coming; His answer was, ‘The worse.’ Of Gloucester’s treachery And of the loyal service of his son When I inform’d him, then he call’d me sot, And told me I had turn’d the wrong side out. What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him; What like, offensive.  GONERIL. [_To Edmund._] Then shall you go no further. It is the cowish terror of his spirit, That dares not undertake. He’ll not feel wrongs Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way May prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother; Hasten his musters and conduct his powers. I must change names at home, and give the distaff Into my husband’s hands. This trusty servant Shall pass between us. Ere long you are like to hear, If you dare venture in your own behalf, A mistress’s command. [_Giving a favour._] Wear this; spare speech; Decline your head. This kiss, if it durst speak, Would stretch thy spirits up into the air. Conceive, and fare thee well.  EDMUND. Yours in the ranks of death.   [_Exit Edmund._]  GONERIL. My most dear Gloucester. O, the difference of man and man! To thee a woman’s services are due; My fool usurps my body.  OSWALD. Madam, here comes my lord.   [_Exit._]   Enter Albany.  GONERIL. I have been worth the whistle.  ALBANY. O Goneril! You are not worth the dust which the rude wind Blows in your face! I fear your disposition; That nature which contemns its origin Cannot be bordered certain in itself. She that herself will sliver and disbranch From her material sap, perforce must wither And come to deadly use.  GONERIL. No more; the text is foolish.  ALBANY. Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile; Filths savour but themselves. What have you done? Tigers, not daughters, what have you perform’d? A father, and a gracious aged man, Whose reverence even the head-lugg’d bear would lick, Most barbarous, most degenerate, have you madded. Could my good brother suffer you to do it? A man, a prince, by him so benefitted! If that the heavens do not their visible spirits Send quickly down to tame these vile offences, It will come, Humanity must perforce prey on itself, Like monsters of the deep.  GONERIL. Milk-liver’d man! That bear’st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs; Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning Thine honour from thy suffering; that not know’st Fools do those villains pity who are punish’d Ere they have done their mischief. Where’s thy drum? France spreads his banners in our noiseless land; With plumed helm thy state begins to threat, Whilst thou, a moral fool, sitt’st still, and criest ‘Alack, why does he so?’  ALBANY. See thyself, devil! Proper deformity seems not in the fiend So horrid as in woman.  GONERIL. O vain fool!  ALBANY. Thou changed and self-cover’d thing, for shame! Be-monster not thy feature! Were’t my fitness To let these hands obey my blood, They are apt enough to dislocate and tear Thy flesh and bones. Howe’er thou art a fiend, A woman’s shape doth shield thee.  GONERIL. Marry, your manhood, mew!   Enter a Messenger.  ALBANY. What news?  MESSENGER. O, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall’s dead; Slain by his servant, going to put out The other eye of Gloucester.  ALBANY. Gloucester’s eyes!  MESSENGER. A servant that he bred, thrill’d with remorse, Oppos’d against the act, bending his sword To his great master; who, thereat enrag’d, Flew on him, and amongst them fell’d him dead; But not without that harmful stroke which since Hath pluck’d him after.  ALBANY. This shows you are above, You justicers, that these our nether crimes So speedily can venge! But, O poor Gloucester! Lost he his other eye?  MESSENGER. Both, both, my lord. This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer; ’Tis from your sister.  GONERIL. [_Aside._] One way I like this well; But being widow, and my Gloucester with her, May all the building in my fancy pluck Upon my hateful life. Another way The news is not so tart. I’ll read, and answer.   [_Exit._]  ALBANY. Where was his son when they did take his eyes?  MESSENGER. Come with my lady hither.  ALBANY. He is not here.  MESSENGER. No, my good lord; I met him back again.  ALBANY. Knows he the wickedness?  MESSENGER. Ay, my good lord. ’Twas he inform’d against him; And quit the house on purpose, that their punishment Might have the freer course.  ALBANY. Gloucester, I live To thank thee for the love thou show’dst the King, And to revenge thine eyes. Come hither, friend, Tell me what more thou know’st.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. The French camp near Dover   Enter Kent and a Gentleman.  KENT. Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back, know you no reason?  GENTLEMAN. Something he left imperfect in the state, which since his coming forth is thought of, which imports to the kingdom so much fear and danger that his personal return was most required and necessary.  KENT. Who hath he left behind him general?  GENTLEMAN. The Mareschal of France, Monsieur La Far.  KENT. Did your letters pierce the queen to any demonstration of grief?  GENTLEMAN. Ay, sir; she took them, read them in my presence; And now and then an ample tear trill’d down Her delicate cheek. It seem’d she was a queen Over her passion; who, most rebel-like, Sought to be king o’er her.  KENT. O, then it mov’d her.  GENTLEMAN. Not to a rage: patience and sorrow strove Who should express her goodliest. You have seen Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears Were like a better day. Those happy smilets That play’d on her ripe lip seem’d not to know What guests were in her eyes; which parted thence As pearls from diamonds dropp’d. In brief, Sorrow would be a rarity most belov’d, If all could so become it.  KENT. Made she no verbal question?  GENTLEMAN. Faith, once or twice she heav’d the name of ‘father’ Pantingly forth, as if it press’d her heart; Cried ‘Sisters, sisters! Shame of ladies! sisters! Kent! father! sisters! What, i’ the storm? i’ the night? Let pity not be believ’d!’ There she shook The holy water from her heavenly eyes, And clamour master’d her: then away she started To deal with grief alone.  KENT. It is the stars, The stars above us govern our conditions; Else one self mate and make could not beget Such different issues. You spoke not with her since?  GENTLEMAN. No.  KENT. Was this before the King return’d?  GENTLEMAN. No, since.  KENT. Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear’s i’ the town; Who sometime, in his better tune, remembers What we are come about, and by no means Will yield to see his daughter.  GENTLEMAN. Why, good sir?  KENT. A sovereign shame so elbows him. His own unkindness, That stripp’d her from his benediction, turn’d her To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights To his dog-hearted daughters, these things sting His mind so venomously that burning shame Detains him from Cordelia.  GENTLEMAN. Alack, poor gentleman!  KENT. Of Albany’s and Cornwall’s powers you heard not?  GENTLEMAN. ’Tis so; they are afoot.  KENT. Well, sir, I’ll bring you to our master Lear And leave you to attend him. Some dear cause Will in concealment wrap me up awhile; When I am known aright, you shall not grieve Lending me this acquaintance. I pray you, go along with me.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IV. The French camp. A Tent   Enter with drum and colours, Cordelia, Physician and Soldiers.  CORDELIA. Alack, ’tis he: why, he was met even now As mad as the vex’d sea; singing aloud; Crown’d with rank fumiter and furrow weeds, With harlocks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers, Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow In our sustaining corn. A century send forth; Search every acre in the high-grown field, And bring him to our eye.   [_Exit an Officer._]  What can man’s wisdom In the restoring his bereaved sense, He that helps him take all my outward worth.  PHYSICIAN. There is means, madam: Our foster nurse of nature is repose, The which he lacks; that to provoke in him Are many simples operative, whose power Will close the eye of anguish.  CORDELIA. All bless’d secrets, All you unpublish’d virtues of the earth, Spring with my tears! Be aidant and remediate In the good man’s distress! Seek, seek for him; Lest his ungovern’d rage dissolve the life That wants the means to lead it.   Enter a Messenger.  MESSENGER. News, madam; The British powers are marching hitherward.  CORDELIA. ’Tis known before. Our preparation stands In expectation of them. O dear father, It is thy business that I go about; Therefore great France My mourning and important tears hath pitied. No blown ambition doth our arms incite, But love, dear love, and our ag’d father’s right: Soon may I hear and see him!   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE V. A Room in Gloucester’s Castle   Enter Regan and Oswald.  REGAN. But are my brother’s powers set forth?  OSWALD. Ay, madam.  REGAN. Himself in person there?  OSWALD. Madam, with much ado. Your sister is the better soldier.  REGAN. Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?  OSWALD. No, madam.  REGAN. What might import my sister’s letter to him?  OSWALD. I know not, lady.  REGAN. Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter. It was great ignorance, Gloucester’s eyes being out, To let him live. Where he arrives he moves All hearts against us. Edmund, I think, is gone In pity of his misery, to dispatch His nighted life; moreover to descry The strength o’ th’enemy.  OSWALD. I must needs after him, madam, with my letter.  REGAN. Our troops set forth tomorrow; stay with us; The ways are dangerous.  OSWALD. I may not, madam: My lady charg’d my duty in this business.  REGAN. Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you Transport her purposes by word? Belike, Somethings, I know not what, I’ll love thee much. Let me unseal the letter.  OSWALD. Madam, I had rather—  REGAN. I know your lady does not love her husband; I am sure of that; and at her late being here She gave strange oeillades and most speaking looks To noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.  OSWALD. I, madam?  REGAN. I speak in understanding; y’are, I know’t: Therefore I do advise you take this note: My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk’d, And more convenient is he for my hand Than for your lady’s. You may gather more. If you do find him, pray you give him this; And when your mistress hears thus much from you, I pray desire her call her wisdom to her. So, fare you well. If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor, Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.  OSWALD. Would I could meet him, madam! I should show What party I do follow.  REGAN. Fare thee well.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE VI. The country near Dover   Enter Gloucester, and Edgar  dressed like a peasant.  GLOUCESTER. When shall I come to the top of that same hill?  EDGAR. You do climb up it now. Look how we labour.  GLOUCESTER. Methinks the ground is even.  EDGAR. Horrible steep. Hark, do you hear the sea?  GLOUCESTER. No, truly.  EDGAR. Why, then, your other senses grow imperfect By your eyes’ anguish.  GLOUCESTER. So may it be indeed. Methinks thy voice is alter’d; and thou speak’st In better phrase and matter than thou didst.  EDGAR. Y’are much deceiv’d: in nothing am I chang’d But in my garments.  GLOUCESTER. Methinks you’re better spoken.  EDGAR. Come on, sir; here’s the place. Stand still. How fearful And dizzy ’tis to cast one’s eyes so low! The crows and choughs that wing the midway air Show scarce so gross as beetles. Half way down Hangs one that gathers samphire—dreadful trade! Methinks he seems no bigger than his head. The fishermen that walk upon the beach Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark, Diminish’d to her cock; her cock a buoy Almost too small for sight: the murmuring surge That on th’unnumber’d idle pebble chafes Cannot be heard so high. I’ll look no more; Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight Topple down headlong.  GLOUCESTER. Set me where you stand.  EDGAR. Give me your hand. You are now within a foot of th’extreme verge. For all beneath the moon would I not leap upright.  GLOUCESTER. Let go my hand. Here, friend, ’s another purse; in it a jewel Well worth a poor man’s taking. Fairies and gods Prosper it with thee! Go thou further off; Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.  EDGAR. Now fare ye well, good sir.   [_Seems to go._]  GLOUCESTER. With all my heart.  EDGAR. [_Aside._] Why I do trifle thus with his despair Is done to cure it.  GLOUCESTER. O you mighty gods! This world I do renounce, and in your sights, Shake patiently my great affliction off: If I could bear it longer, and not fall To quarrel with your great opposeless wills, My snuff and loathed part of nature should Burn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him! Now, fellow, fare thee well.  EDGAR. Gone, sir, farewell.   [_Gloucester leaps, and falls along_]  And yet I know not how conceit may rob The treasury of life when life itself Yields to the theft. Had he been where he thought, By this had thought been past. Alive or dead? Ho you, sir! friend! Hear you, sir? speak! Thus might he pass indeed: yet he revives. What are you, sir?  GLOUCESTER. Away, and let me die.  EDGAR. Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air, So many fathom down precipitating, Thou’dst shiver’d like an egg: but thou dost breathe; Hast heavy substance; bleed’st not; speak’st; art sound. Ten masts at each make not the altitude Which thou hast perpendicularly fell. Thy life is a miracle. Speak yet again.  GLOUCESTER. But have I fall’n, or no?  EDGAR. From the dread summit of this chalky bourn. Look up a-height, the shrill-gorg’d lark so far Cannot be seen or heard. Do but look up.  GLOUCESTER. Alack, I have no eyes. Is wretchedness depriv’d that benefit To end itself by death? ’Twas yet some comfort When misery could beguile the tyrant’s rage And frustrate his proud will.  EDGAR. Give me your arm. Up, so. How is’t? Feel you your legs? You stand.  GLOUCESTER. Too well, too well.  EDGAR. This is above all strangeness. Upon the crown o’ the cliff what thing was that Which parted from you?  GLOUCESTER. A poor unfortunate beggar.  EDGAR. As I stood here below, methought his eyes Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses, Horns whelk’d and waved like the enraged sea. It was some fiend. Therefore, thou happy father, Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours Of men’s impossibilities, have preserv’d thee.  GLOUCESTER. I do remember now: henceforth I’ll bear Affliction till it do cry out itself ‘Enough, enough,’ and die. That thing you speak of, I took it for a man; often ’twould say, ‘The fiend, the fiend’; he led me to that place.  EDGAR. Bear free and patient thoughts. But who comes here?   Enter Lear, fantastically dressed up with flowers.  The safer sense will ne’er accommodate His master thus.  LEAR. No, they cannot touch me for coining. I am the King himself.  EDGAR. O thou side-piercing sight!  LEAR. Nature’s above art in that respect. There’s your press money. That fellow handles his bow like a crow-keeper: draw me a clothier’s yard. Look, look, a mouse! Peace, peace, this piece of toasted cheese will do’t. There’s my gauntlet; I’ll prove it on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. O, well flown, bird! i’ the clout, i’ the clout. Hewgh! Give the word.  EDGAR. Sweet marjoram.  LEAR. Pass.  GLOUCESTER. I know that voice.  LEAR. Ha! Goneril with a white beard! They flattered me like a dog; and told me I had white hairs in my beard ere the black ones were there. To say ‘ay’ and ‘no’ to everything I said ‘ay’ and ‘no’ to was no good divinity. When the rain came to wet me once, and the wind to make me chatter; when the thunder would not peace at my bidding; there I found ’em, there I smelt ’em out. Go to, they are not men o’ their words: they told me I was everything; ’tis a lie, I am not ague-proof.  GLOUCESTER. The trick of that voice I do well remember: Is’t not the King?  LEAR. Ay, every inch a king. When I do stare, see how the subject quakes. I pardon that man’s life. What was thy cause? Adultery? Thou shalt not die: die for adultery! No: The wren goes to’t, and the small gilded fly Does lecher in my sight. Let copulation thrive; For Gloucester’s bastard son was kinder to his father Than my daughters got ’tween the lawful sheets. To’t, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers. Behold yond simp’ring dame, Whose face between her forks presages snow; That minces virtue, and does shake the head To hear of pleasure’s name. The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to’t with a more riotous appetite. Down from the waist they are centaurs, though women all above. But to the girdle do the gods inherit, beneath is all the fiend’s; there’s hell, there’s darkness, there is the sulphurous pit; burning, scalding, stench, consumption. Fie, fie, fie! pah, pah! Give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary, to sweeten my imagination. There’s money for thee.  GLOUCESTER. O, let me kiss that hand!  LEAR. Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.  GLOUCESTER. O ruin’d piece of nature, this great world Shall so wear out to naught. Dost thou know me?  LEAR. I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny at me? No, do thy worst, blind Cupid; I’ll not love. Read thou this challenge; mark but the penning of it.  GLOUCESTER. Were all the letters suns, I could not see one.  EDGAR. I would not take this from report, It is, and my heart breaks at it.  LEAR. Read.  GLOUCESTER. What, with the case of eyes?  LEAR. O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your head, nor no money in your purse? Your eyes are in a heavy case, your purse in a light, yet you see how this world goes.  GLOUCESTER. I see it feelingly.  LEAR. What, art mad? A man may see how the world goes with no eyes. Look with thine ears. See how yon justice rails upon yon simple thief. Hark, in thine ear: change places; and, handy-dandy, which is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen a farmer’s dog bark at a beggar?  GLOUCESTER. Ay, sir.  LEAR. And the creature run from the cur? There thou mightst behold the great image of authority: a dog’s obeyed in office. Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand! Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back; Thou hotly lusts to use her in that kind For which thou whipp’st her. The usurer hangs the cozener. Through tatter’d clothes great vices do appear; Robes and furr’d gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold, And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks; Arm it in rags, a pygmy’s straw does pierce it. None does offend, none, I say none; I’ll able ’em; Take that of me, my friend, who have the power To seal the accuser’s lips. Get thee glass eyes, And like a scurvy politician, seem To see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now: Pull off my boots: harder, harder, so.  EDGAR. O, matter and impertinency mix’d! Reason in madness!  LEAR. If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes. I know thee well enough, thy name is Gloucester. Thou must be patient; we came crying hither: Thou know’st the first time that we smell the air We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee: mark.  GLOUCESTER. Alack, alack the day!  LEAR. When we are born, we cry that we are come To this great stage of fools. This a good block: It were a delicate stratagem to shoe A troop of horse with felt. I’ll put’t in proof And when I have stol’n upon these son-in-laws, Then kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!   Enter a Gentleman with Attendants.  GENTLEMAN. O, here he is: lay hand upon him. Sir, Your most dear daughter—  LEAR. No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even The natural fool of fortune. Use me well; You shall have ransom. Let me have surgeons; I am cut to the brains.  GENTLEMAN. You shall have anything.  LEAR. No seconds? All myself? Why, this would make a man a man of salt, To use his eyes for garden water-pots, Ay, and for laying autumn’s dust.  GENTLEMAN. Good sir.  LEAR. I will die bravely, like a smug bridegroom. What! I will be jovial. Come, come, I am a king, my masters, know you that.  GENTLEMAN. You are a royal one, and we obey you.  LEAR. Then there’s life in’t. Come, and you get it, You shall get it by running. Sa, sa, sa, sa!   [_Exit running. Attendants follow._]  GENTLEMAN. A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch, Past speaking of in a king! Thou hast one daughter Who redeems nature from the general curse Which twain have brought her to.  EDGAR. Hail, gentle sir.  GENTLEMAN. Sir, speed you. What’s your will?  EDGAR. Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?  GENTLEMAN. Most sure and vulgar. Everyone hears that, which can distinguish sound.  EDGAR. But, by your favour, How near’s the other army?  GENTLEMAN. Near and on speedy foot; the main descry Stands on the hourly thought.  EDGAR. I thank you sir, that’s all.  GENTLEMAN. Though that the queen on special cause is here, Her army is mov’d on.  EDGAR. I thank you, sir.   [_Exit Gentleman._]  GLOUCESTER. You ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me; Let not my worser spirit tempt me again To die before you please.  EDGAR. Well pray you, father.  GLOUCESTER. Now, good sir, what are you?  EDGAR. A most poor man, made tame to fortune’s blows; Who, by the art of known and feeling sorrows, Am pregnant to good pity. Give me your hand, I’ll lead you to some biding.  GLOUCESTER. Hearty thanks: The bounty and the benison of heaven To boot, and boot.   Enter Oswald.  OSWALD. A proclaim’d prize! Most happy! That eyeless head of thine was first fram’d flesh To raise my fortunes. Thou old unhappy traitor, Briefly thyself remember. The sword is out That must destroy thee.  GLOUCESTER. Now let thy friendly hand Put strength enough to’t.   [_Edgar interposes._]  OSWALD. Wherefore, bold peasant, Dar’st thou support a publish’d traitor? Hence; Lest that th’infection of his fortune take Like hold on thee. Let go his arm.  EDGAR. Chill not let go, zir, without vurther ’casion.  OSWALD. Let go, slave, or thou diest!  EDGAR. Good gentleman, go your gait, and let poor volke pass. An chud ha’ bin zwaggered out of my life, ’twould not ha’ bin zo long as ’tis by a vortnight. Nay, come not near th’old man; keep out, che vor ye, or ise try whether your costard or my ballow be the harder: chill be plain with you.  OSWALD. Out, dunghill!  EDGAR. Chill pick your teeth, zir. Come! No matter vor your foins.   [_They fight, and Edgar knocks him down._]  OSWALD. Slave, thou hast slain me. Villain, take my purse. If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body; And give the letters which thou find’st about me To Edmund, Earl of Gloucester. Seek him out Upon the British party. O, untimely death!   [_Dies._]  EDGAR. I know thee well. A serviceable villain, As duteous to the vices of thy mistress As badness would desire.  GLOUCESTER. What, is he dead?  EDGAR. Sit you down, father; rest you. Let’s see these pockets; the letters that he speaks of May be my friends. He’s dead; I am only sorry He had no other deathsman. Let us see: Leave, gentle wax; and, manners, blame us not. To know our enemies’ minds, we rip their hearts, Their papers is more lawful. [_Reads._] ‘Let our reciprocal vows be remembered. You have many opportunities to cut him off: if your will want not, time and place will be fruitfully offered. There is nothing done if he return the conqueror: then am I the prisoner, and his bed my gaol; from the loathed warmth whereof deliver me, and supply the place for your labour. ‘Your (wife, so I would say) affectionate servant, ‘Goneril.’ O indistinguish’d space of woman’s will! A plot upon her virtuous husband’s life, And the exchange my brother! Here in the sands Thee I’ll rake up, the post unsanctified Of murderous lechers: and in the mature time, With this ungracious paper strike the sight Of the death-practis’d Duke: for him ’tis well That of thy death and business I can tell.   [_Exit Edgar, dragging out the body._]  GLOUCESTER. The King is mad: how stiff is my vile sense, That I stand up, and have ingenious feeling Of my huge sorrows! Better I were distract: So should my thoughts be sever’d from my griefs, And woes by wrong imaginations lose The knowledge of themselves.   [_A drum afar off._]  EDGAR. Give me your hand. Far off methinks I hear the beaten drum. Come, father, I’ll bestow you with a friend.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE VII. A Tent in the French Camp  Lear on a bed, asleep, soft music playing; Physician, Gentleman and others attending.   Enter Cordelia and Kent.  CORDELIA. O thou good Kent, how shall I live and work To match thy goodness? My life will be too short, And every measure fail me.  KENT. To be acknowledg’d, madam, is o’erpaid. All my reports go with the modest truth; Nor more, nor clipp’d, but so.  CORDELIA. Be better suited, These weeds are memories of those worser hours: I prithee put them off.  KENT. Pardon, dear madam; Yet to be known shortens my made intent. My boon I make it that you know me not Till time and I think meet.  CORDELIA. Then be’t so, my good lord. [_To the Physician._] How does the King?  PHYSICIAN. Madam, sleeps still.  CORDELIA. O you kind gods, Cure this great breach in his abused nature! The untun’d and jarring senses, O, wind up Of this child-changed father.  PHYSICIAN. So please your majesty That we may wake the King: he hath slept long.  CORDELIA. Be govern’d by your knowledge, and proceed I’ the sway of your own will. Is he array’d?  PHYSICIAN. Ay, madam. In the heaviness of sleep We put fresh garments on him. Be by, good madam, when we do awake him; I doubt not of his temperance.  CORDELIA. Very well.  PHYSICIAN. Please you draw near. Louder the music there!  CORDELIA. O my dear father! Restoration hang Thy medicine on my lips; and let this kiss Repair those violent harms that my two sisters Have in thy reverence made!  KENT. Kind and dear princess!  CORDELIA. Had you not been their father, these white flakes Did challenge pity of them. Was this a face To be oppos’d against the warring winds? To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder? In the most terrible and nimble stroke Of quick cross lightning? to watch, poor perdu! With this thin helm? Mine enemy’s dog, Though he had bit me, should have stood that night Against my fire; and wast thou fain, poor father, To hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn In short and musty straw? Alack, alack! ’Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once Had not concluded all. He wakes; speak to him.  PHYSICIAN. Madam, do you; ’tis fittest.  CORDELIA. How does my royal lord? How fares your majesty?  LEAR. You do me wrong to take me out o’ the grave. Thou art a soul in bliss; but I am bound Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears Do scald like molten lead.  CORDELIA. Sir, do you know me?  LEAR. You are a spirit, I know: when did you die?  CORDELIA. Still, still, far wide!  PHYSICIAN. He’s scarce awake: let him alone awhile.  LEAR. Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight? I am mightily abus’d. I should e’en die with pity, To see another thus. I know not what to say. I will not swear these are my hands: let’s see; I feel this pin prick. Would I were assur’d Of my condition!  CORDELIA. O, look upon me, sir, And hold your hands in benediction o’er me. No, sir, you must not kneel.  LEAR. Pray, do not mock me: I am a very foolish fond old man, Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less; And to deal plainly, I fear I am not in my perfect mind. Methinks I should know you, and know this man; Yet I am doubtful: for I am mainly ignorant What place this is; and all the skill I have Remembers not these garments; nor I know not Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me; For, as I am a man, I think this lady To be my child Cordelia.  CORDELIA. And so I am. I am.  LEAR. Be your tears wet? Yes, faith. I pray weep not: If you have poison for me, I will drink it. I know you do not love me; for your sisters Have, as I do remember, done me wrong. You have some cause, they have not.  CORDELIA. No cause, no cause.  LEAR. Am I in France?  KENT. In your own kingdom, sir.  LEAR. Do not abuse me.  PHYSICIAN. Be comforted, good madam, the great rage, You see, is kill’d in him: and yet it is danger To make him even o’er the time he has lost. Desire him to go in; trouble him no more Till further settling.  CORDELIA. Will’t please your highness walk?  LEAR. You must bear with me: Pray you now, forget and forgive: I am old and foolish.   [_Exeunt Lear, Cordelia, Physician and Attendants._]  GENTLEMAN. Holds it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was so slain?  KENT. Most certain, sir.  GENTLEMAN. Who is conductor of his people?  KENT. As ’tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester.  GENTLEMAN. They say Edgar, his banished son, is with the Earl of Kent in Germany.  KENT. Report is changeable. ’Tis time to look about; the powers of the kingdom approach apace.  GENTLEMAN. The arbitrement is like to be bloody. Fare you well, sir.   [_Exit._]  KENT. My point and period will be throughly wrought, Or well or ill, as this day’s battle’s fought.   [_Exit._]
  ACT V  SCENE I. The Camp of the British Forces near Dover
 Enter, with drum and colours Edmund, Regan, Officers, Soldiers and  others.  EDMUND. Know of the Duke if his last purpose hold, Or whether since he is advis’d by aught To change the course, he’s full of alteration And self-reproving, bring his constant pleasure.   [_To an Officer, who goes out._]  REGAN. Our sister’s man is certainly miscarried.  EDMUND. ’Tis to be doubted, madam.  REGAN. Now, sweet lord, You know the goodness I intend upon you: Tell me but truly, but then speak the truth, Do you not love my sister?  EDMUND. In honour’d love.  REGAN. But have you never found my brother’s way To the forfended place?  EDMUND. That thought abuses you.  REGAN. I am doubtful that you have been conjunct And bosom’d with her, as far as we call hers.  EDMUND. No, by mine honour, madam.  REGAN. I never shall endure her, dear my lord, Be not familiar with her.  EDMUND. Fear not, She and the Duke her husband!   Enter with drum and colours Albany, Goneril and Soldiers.  GONERIL. [_Aside._] I had rather lose the battle than that sister Should loosen him and me.  ALBANY. Our very loving sister, well be-met. Sir, this I heard: the King is come to his daughter, With others whom the rigour of our state Forc’d to cry out. Where I could not be honest, I never yet was valiant. For this business, It toucheth us as France invades our land, Not bolds the King, with others whom I fear Most just and heavy causes make oppose.  EDMUND. Sir, you speak nobly.  REGAN. Why is this reason’d?  GONERIL. Combine together ’gainst the enemy; For these domestic and particular broils Are not the question here.  ALBANY. Let’s, then, determine with the ancient of war On our proceeding.  EDMUND. I shall attend you presently at your tent.  REGAN. Sister, you’ll go with us?  GONERIL. No.  REGAN. ’Tis most convenient; pray you, go with us.  GONERIL. [_Aside_.] O, ho, I know the riddle. I will go.   [_Exeunt Edmund, Regan, Goneril, Officers, Soldiers and Attendants._]   As they are going out, enter Edgar disguised.  EDGAR. If e’er your grace had speech with man so poor, Hear me one word.  ALBANY. I’ll overtake you. Speak.  EDGAR. Before you fight the battle, ope this letter. If you have victory, let the trumpet sound For him that brought it: wretched though I seem, I can produce a champion that will prove What is avouched there. If you miscarry, Your business of the world hath so an end, And machination ceases. Fortune love you!  ALBANY. Stay till I have read the letter.  EDGAR. I was forbid it. When time shall serve, let but the herald cry, And I’ll appear again.  ALBANY. Why, fare thee well. I will o’erlook thy paper.   [_Exit Edgar._]   Enter Edmund.  EDMUND. The enemy’s in view; draw up your powers. Here is the guess of their true strength and forces By diligent discovery; but your haste Is now urg’d on you.  ALBANY. We will greet the time.   [_Exit._]  EDMUND. To both these sisters have I sworn my love; Each jealous of the other, as the stung Are of the adder. Which of them shall I take? Both? One? Or neither? Neither can be enjoy’d, If both remain alive. To take the widow Exasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril; And hardly shall I carry out my side, Her husband being alive. Now, then, we’ll use His countenance for the battle; which being done, Let her who would be rid of him devise His speedy taking off. As for the mercy Which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia, The battle done, and they within our power, Shall never see his pardon: for my state Stands on me to defend, not to debate.   [_Exit._]  SCENE II. A field between the two Camps   Alarum within. Enter with drum and colours, Lear, Cordelia and their  Forces, and exeunt.   Enter Edgar and Gloucester.  EDGAR. Here, father, take the shadow of this tree For your good host; pray that the right may thrive: If ever I return to you again, I’ll bring you comfort.  GLOUCESTER. Grace go with you, sir!   [_Exit Edgar._]   Alarum and retreat within. Enter Edgar.  EDGAR. Away, old man, give me thy hand, away! King Lear hath lost, he and his daughter ta’en: Give me thy hand; come on!  GLOUCESTER. No further, sir; a man may rot even here.  EDGAR. What, in ill thoughts again? Men must endure Their going hence, even as their coming hither; Ripeness is all. Come on.  GLOUCESTER. And that’s true too.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. The British Camp near Dover   Enter in conquest with drum and colours, Edmund, Lear and Cordelia as prisoners; Officers, Soldiers, &c.  EDMUND. Some officers take them away: good guard Until their greater pleasures first be known That are to censure them.  CORDELIA. We are not the first Who with best meaning have incurr’d the worst. For thee, oppressed King, I am cast down; Myself could else out-frown false fortune’s frown. Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?  LEAR. No, no, no, no. Come, let’s away to prison: We two alone will sing like birds i’ the cage: When thou dost ask me blessing I’ll kneel down And ask of thee forgiveness. So we’ll live, And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues Talk of court news; and we’ll talk with them too, Who loses and who wins; who’s in, who’s out; And take upon’s the mystery of things, As if we were God’s spies. And we’ll wear out, In a wall’d prison, packs and sects of great ones That ebb and flow by the moon.  EDMUND. Take them away.  LEAR. Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia, The gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught thee? He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven, And fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes; The good years shall devour them, flesh and fell, Ere they shall make us weep! We’ll see ’em starve first: come.   [_Exeunt Lear and Cordelia, guarded._]  EDMUND. Come hither, captain, hark. Take thou this note [_giving a paper_]; go follow them to prison. One step I have advanc’d thee; if thou dost As this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way To noble fortunes: know thou this, that men Are as the time is; to be tender-minded Does not become a sword. Thy great employment Will not bear question; either say thou’lt do’t, Or thrive by other means.  CAPTAIN. I’ll do’t, my lord.  EDMUND. About it; and write happy when thou hast done. Mark, I say, instantly; and carry it so As I have set it down.  CAPTAIN. I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats; If it be man’s work, I’ll do’t.   [_Exit._]   Flourish. Enter Albany, Goneril, Regan, Officers and Attendants.  ALBANY. Sir, you have show’d today your valiant strain, And fortune led you well: you have the captives Who were the opposites of this day’s strife: I do require them of you, so to use them As we shall find their merits and our safety May equally determine.  EDMUND. Sir, I thought it fit To send the old and miserable King To some retention and appointed guard; Whose age has charms in it, whose title more, To pluck the common bosom on his side, And turn our impress’d lances in our eyes Which do command them. With him I sent the queen; My reason all the same; and they are ready Tomorrow, or at further space, to appear Where you shall hold your session. At this time We sweat and bleed: the friend hath lost his friend; And the best quarrels in the heat are curs’d By those that feel their sharpness. The question of Cordelia and her father Requires a fitter place.  ALBANY. Sir, by your patience, I hold you but a subject of this war, Not as a brother.  REGAN. That’s as we list to grace him. Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded Ere you had spoke so far. He led our powers; Bore the commission of my place and person; The which immediacy may well stand up And call itself your brother.  GONERIL. Not so hot: In his own grace he doth exalt himself, More than in your addition.  REGAN. In my rights, By me invested, he compeers the best.  ALBANY. That were the most, if he should husband you.  REGAN. Jesters do oft prove prophets.  GONERIL. Holla, holla! That eye that told you so look’d but asquint.  REGAN. Lady, I am not well; else I should answer From a full-flowing stomach. General, Take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony; Dispose of them, of me; the walls are thine: Witness the world that I create thee here My lord and master.  GONERIL. Mean you to enjoy him?  ALBANY. The let-alone lies not in your good will.  EDMUND. Nor in thine, lord.  ALBANY. Half-blooded fellow, yes.  REGAN. [_To Edmund._] Let the drum strike, and prove my title thine.  ALBANY. Stay yet; hear reason: Edmund, I arrest thee On capital treason; and, in thine arrest, This gilded serpent. [_pointing to Goneril._] For your claim, fair sister, I bar it in the interest of my wife; ’Tis she is sub-contracted to this lord, And I her husband contradict your bans. If you will marry, make your loves to me, My lady is bespoke.  GONERIL. An interlude!  ALBANY. Thou art arm’d, Gloucester. Let the trumpet sound: If none appear to prove upon thy person Thy heinous, manifest, and many treasons, There is my pledge. [_Throwing down a glove._] I’ll make it on thy heart, Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less Than I have here proclaim’d thee.  REGAN. Sick, O, sick!  GONERIL. [_Aside._] If not, I’ll ne’er trust medicine.  EDMUND. There’s my exchange. [_Throwing down a glove._] What in the world he is That names me traitor, villain-like he lies. Call by thy trumpet: he that dares approach, On him, on you, who not? I will maintain My truth and honour firmly.  ALBANY. A herald, ho!   Enter a Herald.  Trust to thy single virtue; for thy soldiers, All levied in my name, have in my name Took their discharge.  REGAN. My sickness grows upon me.  ALBANY. She is not well. Convey her to my tent.   [_Exit Regan, led._]  Come hither, herald. Let the trumpet sound And read out this.  OFFICER. Sound, trumpet!   [_A trumpet sounds._]  HERALD. [_Reads._] ‘If any man of quality or degree within the lists of the army will maintain upon Edmund, supposed Earl of Gloucester, that he is a manifold traitor, let him appear by the third sound of the trumpet. He is bold in his defence.’  EDMUND. Sound!   [_First trumpet._]  HERALD. Again!   [_Second trumpet._]  HERALD. Again!   Third trumpet. Trumpet answers within. Enter Edgar, armed, preceded by  a trumpet.  ALBANY. Ask him his purposes, why he appears Upon this call o’ the trumpet.  HERALD. What are you? Your name, your quality? and why you answer This present summons?  EDGAR. Know my name is lost; By treason’s tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit. Yet am I noble as the adversary I come to cope.  ALBANY. Which is that adversary?  EDGAR. What’s he that speaks for Edmund, Earl of Gloucester?  EDMUND. Himself, what say’st thou to him?  EDGAR. Draw thy sword, That if my speech offend a noble heart, Thy arm may do thee justice: here is mine. Behold, it is the privilege of mine honours, My oath, and my profession: I protest, Maugre thy strength, youth, place, and eminence, Despite thy victor sword and fire-new fortune, Thy valour and thy heart, thou art a traitor; False to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father; Conspirant ’gainst this high illustrious prince; And, from the extremest upward of thy head To the descent and dust beneath thy foot, A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou ‘No,’ This sword, this arm, and my best spirits are bent To prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak, Thou liest.  EDMUND. In wisdom I should ask thy name; But since thy outside looks so fair and warlike, And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes, What safe and nicely I might well delay By rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn. Back do I toss those treasons to thy head, With the hell-hated lie o’erwhelm thy heart; Which for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise, This sword of mine shall give them instant way, Where they shall rest for ever. Trumpets, speak!   [_Alarums. They fight. Edmund falls._]  ALBANY. Save him, save him!  GONERIL. This is mere practice, Gloucester: By the law of arms thou wast not bound to answer An unknown opposite; thou art not vanquish’d, But cozen’d and beguil’d.  ALBANY. Shut your mouth, dame, Or with this paper shall I stop it. Hold, sir; Thou worse than any name, read thine own evil. No tearing, lady; I perceive you know it.   [_Gives the letter to Edmund._]  GONERIL. Say if I do, the laws are mine, not thine: Who can arraign me for’t?   [_Exit._]  ALBANY. Most monstrous! O! Know’st thou this paper?  EDMUND. Ask me not what I know.  ALBANY. [_To an Officer, who goes out._] Go after her; she’s desperate; govern her.  EDMUND. What you have charg’d me with, that have I done; And more, much more; the time will bring it out. ’Tis past, and so am I. But what art thou That hast this fortune on me? If thou’rt noble, I do forgive thee.  EDGAR. Let’s exchange charity. I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund; If more, the more thou hast wrong’d me. My name is Edgar and thy father’s son. The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices Make instruments to plague us: The dark and vicious place where thee he got Cost him his eyes.  EDMUND. Thou hast spoken right, ’tis true; The wheel is come full circle; I am here.  ALBANY. Methought thy very gait did prophesy A royal nobleness. I must embrace thee. Let sorrow split my heart if ever I Did hate thee or thy father.  EDGAR. Worthy prince, I know’t.  ALBANY. Where have you hid yourself? How have you known the miseries of your father?  EDGAR. By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale; And when ’tis told, O that my heart would burst! The bloody proclamation to escape That follow’d me so near,—O, our lives’ sweetness! That with the pain of death we’d hourly die Rather than die at once!—taught me to shift Into a madman’s rags; t’assume a semblance That very dogs disdain’d; and in this habit Met I my father with his bleeding rings, Their precious stones new lost; became his guide, Led him, begg’d for him, sav’d him from despair; Never,—O fault!—reveal’d myself unto him Until some half hour past, when I was arm’d; Not sure, though hoping of this good success, I ask’d his blessing, and from first to last Told him my pilgrimage. But his flaw’d heart, Alack, too weak the conflict to support! ’Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief, Burst smilingly.  EDMUND. This speech of yours hath mov’d me, And shall perchance do good, but speak you on; You look as you had something more to say.  ALBANY. If there be more, more woeful, hold it in; For I am almost ready to dissolve, Hearing of this.  EDGAR. This would have seem’d a period To such as love not sorrow; but another, To amplify too much, would make much more, And top extremity. Whilst I was big in clamour, came there a man Who, having seen me in my worst estate, Shunn’d my abhorr’d society; but then finding Who ’twas that so endur’d, with his strong arms He fastened on my neck, and bellow’d out As he’d burst heaven; threw him on my father; Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him That ever ear receiv’d, which in recounting His grief grew puissant, and the strings of life Began to crack. Twice then the trumpets sounded, And there I left him tranc’d.  ALBANY. But who was this?  EDGAR. Kent, sir, the banish’d Kent; who in disguise Follow’d his enemy king and did him service Improper for a slave.   Enter a Gentleman hastily, with a bloody knife.  GENTLEMAN. Help, help! O, help!  EDGAR. What kind of help?  ALBANY. Speak, man.  EDGAR. What means this bloody knife?  GENTLEMAN. ’Tis hot, it smokes; It came even from the heart of—O! she’s dead!  ALBANY. Who dead? Speak, man.  GENTLEMAN. Your lady, sir, your lady; and her sister By her is poisoned; she hath confesses it.  EDMUND. I was contracted to them both, all three Now marry in an instant.  EDGAR. Here comes Kent.   Enter Kent.  ALBANY. Produce their bodies, be they alive or dead. This judgement of the heavens that makes us tremble Touches us not with pity. O, is this he? The time will not allow the compliment Which very manners urges.  KENT. I am come To bid my King and master aye good night: Is he not here?  ALBANY. Great thing of us forgot! Speak, Edmund, where’s the King? and where’s Cordelia?   The bodies of Goneril and Regan are brought in.  Seest thou this object, Kent?  KENT. Alack, why thus?  EDMUND. Yet Edmund was belov’d. The one the other poisoned for my sake, And after slew herself.  ALBANY. Even so. Cover their faces.  EDMUND. I pant for life. Some good I mean to do, Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send, Be brief in it, to the castle; for my writ Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia; Nay, send in time.  ALBANY. Run, run, O, run!  EDGAR. To who, my lord? Who has the office? Send Thy token of reprieve.  EDMUND. Well thought on: take my sword, Give it the captain.  EDGAR. Haste thee for thy life.   [_Exit Edgar._]  EDMUND. He hath commission from thy wife and me To hang Cordelia in the prison, and To lay the blame upon her own despair, That she fordid herself.  ALBANY. The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.   [_Edmund is borne off._]   Enter Lear with Cordelia dead in his arms; Edgar, Officer and others following.  LEAR. Howl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stone. Had I your tongues and eyes, I’ld use them so That heaven’s vault should crack. She’s gone for ever! I know when one is dead, and when one lives; She’s dead as earth. Lend me a looking glass; If that her breath will mist or stain the stone, Why, then she lives.  KENT. Is this the promis’d end?  EDGAR. Or image of that horror?  ALBANY. Fall, and cease!  LEAR. This feather stirs; she lives! If it be so, It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows That ever I have felt.  KENT. O, my good master! [_Kneeling._]  LEAR. Prithee, away!  EDGAR. ’Tis noble Kent, your friend.  LEAR. A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all! I might have sav’d her; now she’s gone for ever! Cordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha! What is’t thou say’st? Her voice was ever soft, Gentle, and low, an excellent thing in woman. I kill’d the slave that was a-hanging thee.  OFFICER. ’Tis true, my lords, he did.  LEAR. Did I not, fellow? I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion I would have made them skip. I am old now, And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you? Mine eyes are not o’ the best, I’ll tell you straight.  KENT. If Fortune brag of two she lov’d and hated, One of them we behold.  LEAR. This is a dull sight. Are you not Kent?  KENT. The same, Your servant Kent. Where is your servant Caius?  LEAR. He’s a good fellow, I can tell you that; He’ll strike, and quickly too:. He’s dead and rotten.  KENT. No, my good lord; I am the very man.  LEAR. I’ll see that straight.  KENT. That from your first of difference and decay Have follow’d your sad steps.  LEAR. You are welcome hither.  KENT. Nor no man else. All’s cheerless, dark and deadly. Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves, And desperately are dead.  LEAR. Ay, so I think.  ALBANY. He knows not what he says; and vain is it That we present us to him.  EDGAR. Very bootless.   Enter an Officer.  OFFICER. Edmund is dead, my lord.  ALBANY. That’s but a trifle here. You lords and noble friends, know our intent. What comfort to this great decay may come Shall be applied. For us, we will resign, During the life of this old majesty, To him our absolute power; [_to Edgar and Kent_] you to your rights; With boot and such addition as your honours Have more than merited. All friends shall taste The wages of their virtue and all foes The cup of their deservings. O, see, see!  LEAR. And my poor fool is hang’d! No, no, no life! Why should a dog, a horse, a rat have life, And thou no breath at all? Thou’lt come no more, Never, never, never, never, never! Pray you undo this button. Thank you, sir. Do you see this? Look on her: look, her lips, Look there, look there!   [_He dies._]  EDGAR. He faints! My lord, my lord!  KENT. Break, heart; I prithee break!  EDGAR. Look up, my lord.  KENT. Vex not his ghost: O, let him pass! He hates him That would upon the rack of this rough world Stretch him out longer.  EDGAR. He is gone indeed.  KENT. The wonder is, he hath endur’d so long: He but usurp’d his life.  ALBANY. Bear them from hence. Our present business Is general woe. [_To Edgar and Kent._] Friends of my soul, you twain, Rule in this realm and the gor’d state sustain.  KENT. I have a journey, sir, shortly to go; My master calls me, I must not say no.  EDGAR. The weight of this sad time we must obey; Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say. The oldest hath borne most; we that are young Shall never see so much, nor live so long.   [_Exeunt with a dead march._]

SCENE: Navarre
  ACT I  SCENE I. The King of Navarre’s park
Enter Ferdinand, King of Navarre, Berowne, Longaville and Dumaine.  KING. Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives, Live registered upon our brazen tombs, And then grace us in the disgrace of death; When, spite of cormorant devouring time, Th’ endeavour of this present breath may buy That honour which shall bate his scythe’s keen edge, And make us heirs of all eternity. Therefore, brave conquerors, for so you are That war against your own affections And the huge army of the world’s desires, Our late edict shall strongly stand in force. Navarre shall be the wonder of the world; Our court shall be a little academe, Still and contemplative in living art. You three, Berowne, Dumaine and Longaville, Have sworn for three years’ term to live with me, My fellow-scholars, and to keep those statutes That are recorded in this schedule here. Your oaths are passed, and now subscribe your names, That his own hand may strike his honour down That violates the smallest branch herein. If you are armed to do as sworn to do, Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too.  LONGAVILLE. I am resolved. ’Tis but a three years’ fast. The mind shall banquet, though the body pine. Fat paunches have lean pates, and dainty bits Make rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits.  [_He signs._]  DUMAINE. My loving lord, Dumaine is mortified. The grosser manner of these world’s delights He throws upon the gross world’s baser slaves. To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die, With all these living in philosophy.  [_He signs._]  BEROWNE. I can but say their protestation over. So much, dear liege, I have already sworn, That is, to live and study here three years. But there are other strict observances: As not to see a woman in that term, Which I hope well is not enrolled there; And one day in a week to touch no food, And but one meal on every day beside, The which I hope is not enrolled there; And then to sleep but three hours in the night, And not be seen to wink of all the day, When I was wont to think no harm all night, And make a dark night too of half the day, Which I hope well is not enrolled there. O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep, Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep.  KING. Your oath is passed to pass away from these.  BEROWNE. Let me say no, my liege, an if you please. I only swore to study with your Grace And stay here in your court for three years’ space.  LONGAVILLE. You swore to that, Berowne, and to the rest.  BEROWNE. By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest. What is the end of study, let me know?  KING. Why, that to know which else we should not know.  BEROWNE. Things hid and barred, you mean, from common sense?  KING. Ay, that is study’s god-like recompense.  BEROWNE. Come on, then, I will swear to study so, To know the thing I am forbid to know: As thus, to study where I well may dine,     When I to feast expressly am forbid; Or study where to meet some mistress fine,     When mistresses from common sense are hid; Or, having sworn too hard-a-keeping oath, Study to break it, and not break my troth. If study’s gain be thus, and this be so, Study knows that which yet it doth not know. Swear me to this, and I will ne’er say no.  KING. These be the stops that hinder study quite, And train our intellects to vain delight.  BEROWNE. Why, all delights are vain, but that most vain Which, with pain purchased, doth inherit pain: As painfully to pore upon a book     To seek the light of truth, while truth the while Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look.     Light seeking light doth light of light beguile; So, ere you find where light in darkness lies, Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes. Study me how to please the eye indeed     By fixing it upon a fairer eye, Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed,     And give him light that it was blinded by. Study is like the heaven’s glorious sun,     That will not be deep-searched with saucy looks; Small have continual plodders ever won,     Save base authority from others’ books. These earthly godfathers of heaven’s lights,     That give a name to every fixed star, Have no more profit of their shining nights     Than those that walk and wot not what they are. Too much to know is to know naught but fame, And every godfather can give a name.  KING. How well he’s read, to reason against reading.  DUMAINE. Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding.  LONGAVILLE. He weeds the corn, and still lets grow the weeding.  BEROWNE. The spring is near when green geese are a-breeding.  DUMAINE. How follows that?  BEROWNE. Fit in his place and time.  DUMAINE. In reason nothing.  BEROWNE. Something then in rhyme.  LONGAVILLE. Berowne is like an envious sneaping frost That bites the first-born infants of the spring.  BEROWNE. Well, say I am. Why should proud summer boast Before the birds have any cause to sing? Why should I joy in any abortive birth? At Christmas I no more desire a rose Than wish a snow in May’s new-fangled shows, But like of each thing that in season grows. So you, to study now it is too late, Climb o’er the house to unlock the little gate.  KING. Well, sit you out. Go home, Berowne. Adieu.  BEROWNE. No, my good lord, I have sworn to stay with you, And though I have for barbarism spoke more     Than for that angel knowledge you can say, Yet confident I’ll keep what I have sworn     And bide the penance of each three years’ day. Give me the paper, let me read the same, And to the strictest decrees I’ll write my name.  KING. How well this yielding rescues thee from shame.  BEROWNE. [_Reads_.] _Item, That no woman shall come within a mile of my court._ Hath this been proclaimed?  LONGAVILLE. Four days ago.  BEROWNE. Let’s see the penalty. [_Reads_.] _On pain of losing her tongue._ Who devised this penalty?  LONGAVILLE. Marry, that did I.  BEROWNE. Sweet lord, and why?  LONGAVILLE. To fright them hence with that dread penalty.  BEROWNE. A dangerous law against gentility. [_Reads_.] _Item, If any man be seen to talk with a woman within the term of three years, he shall endure such public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise._ This article, my liege, yourself must break,     For well you know here comes in embassy The French King’s daughter, with yourself to speak—     A mild of grace and complete majesty— About surrender up of Aquitaine     To her decrepit, sick, and bedrid father. Therefore this article is made in vain,     Or vainly comes th’ admired Princess hither.  KING. What say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot.  BEROWNE. So study evermore is overshot. While it doth study to have what it would, It doth forget to do the thing it should; And when it hath the thing it hunteth most, ’Tis won as towns with fire: so won, so lost.  KING. We must of force dispense with this decree. She must lie here on mere necessity.  BEROWNE. Necessity will make us all forsworn Three thousand times within this three years’ space; For every man with his affects is born, Not by might mastered, but by special grace. If I break faith, this word shall speak for me: I am forsworn on mere necessity. So to the laws at large I write my name, And he that breaks them in the least degree Stands in attainder of eternal shame. Suggestions are to other as to me; But I believe, although I seem so loath, I am the last that will last keep his oath.  [_He signs._]  But is there no quick recreation granted?  KING. Ay, that there is. Our court, you know, is haunted With a refined traveller of Spain, A man in all the world’s new fashion planted, That hath a mint of phrases in his brain; One who the music of his own vain tongue Doth ravish like enchanting harmony, A man of complements, whom right and wrong Have chose as umpire of their mutiny. This child of fancy, that Armado hight, For interim to our studies shall relate In high-born words the worth of many a knight From tawny Spain lost in the world’s debate. How you delight, my lords, I know not, I, But I protest I love to hear him lie, And I will use him for my minstrelsy.  BEROWNE. Armado is a most illustrious wight, A man of fire-new words, fashion’s own knight.  LONGAVILLE. Costard the swain and he shall be our sport, And so to study three years is but short.  Enter Dull, a Constable, with a letter, and Costard.  DULL. Which is the Duke’s own person?  BEROWNE. This, fellow. What wouldst?  DULL. I myself reprehend his own person, for I am his Grace’s farborough. But I would see his own person in flesh and blood.  BEROWNE. This is he.  DULL. Signior Arm… Arm… commends you. There’s villainy abroad. This letter will tell you more.  COSTARD. Sir, the contempts thereof are as touching me.  KING. A letter from the magnificent Armado.  BEROWNE. How long soever the matter, I hope in God for high words.  LONGAVILLE. A high hope for a low heaven. God grant us patience!  BEROWNE. To hear, or forbear laughing?  LONGAVILLE. To hear meekly, sir, and to laugh moderately, or to forbear both.  BEROWNE. Well, sir, be it as the style shall give us cause to climb in the merriness.  COSTARD. The matter is to me, sir, as concerning Jaquenetta. The manner of it is, I was taken with the manner.  BEROWNE. In what manner?  COSTARD. In manner and form following, sir, all those three. I was seen with her in the manor-house, sitting with her upon the form, and taken following her into the park, which, put together, is “in manner and form following”. Now, sir, for the manner. It is the manner of a man to speak to a woman. For the form—in some form.  BEROWNE. For the “following”, sir?  COSTARD. As it shall follow in my correction, and God defend the right!  KING. Will you hear this letter with attention?  BEROWNE. As we would hear an oracle.  COSTARD. Such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh.  KING. [_Reads_.] _Great deputy, the welkin’s vicegerent and sole dominator of Navarre, my soul’s earth’s god and body’s fostering patron—_  COSTARD. Not a word of Costard yet.  KING. [_Reads_.] _So it is—_  COSTARD. It may be so; but if he say it is so, he is, in telling true, but so.  KING. Peace!  COSTARD. Be to me, and every man that dares not fight.  KING. No words!  COSTARD. Of other men’s secrets, I beseech you.  KING. [_Reads_.] _So it is, besieged with sable-coloured melancholy, I did commend the black-oppressing humour to the most wholesome physic of thy health-giving air; and, as I am a gentleman, betook myself to walk. The time when? About the sixth hour, when beasts most graze, birds best peck, and men sit down to that nourishment which is called supper. So much for the time when. Now for the ground which? Which, I mean, I walked upon. It is ycleped thy park. Then for the place, where? Where, I mean, I did encounter that obscene and most preposterous event that draweth from my snow-white pen the ebon-coloured ink, which here thou viewest, beholdest, surveyest, or seest. But to the place where? It standeth north-north-east and by east from the west corner of thy curious-knotted garden. There did I see that low-spirited swain, that base minnow of thy mirth—_  COSTARD. Me?  KING. [_Reads_.] _That unlettered small-knowing soul—_  COSTARD. Me?  KING. [_Reads_.] _That shallow vassal—_  COSTARD. Still me?  KING. [_Reads_.] _Which, as I remember, hight Costard—_  COSTARD. O me!  KING. [_Reads_.] _Sorted and consorted, contrary to thy established proclaimed edict and continent canon, which with, O, with—but with this I passion to say wherewith—_  COSTARD. With a wench.  KING. [_Reads_.] _With a child of our grandmother Eve, a female; or, for thy more sweet understanding, a woman. Him, I, as my ever-esteemed duty pricks me on, have sent to thee, to receive the meed of punishment, by thy sweet Grace’s officer, Antony Dull, a man of good repute, carriage, bearing, and estimation._  DULL. Me, an’t shall please you; I am Antony Dull.  KING. [_Reads_.] _For Jaquenetta, so is the weaker vessel called which I apprehended with the aforesaid swain, I keep her as a vessel of thy law’s fury, and shall, at the least of thy sweet notice, bring her to trial. Thine, in all compliments of devoted and heartburning heat of duty,                     Don Adriano de Armado._  BEROWNE. This is not so well as I looked for, but the best that ever I heard.  KING. Ay, the best for the worst. But, sirrah, what say you to this?  COSTARD. Sir, I confess the wench.  KING. Did you hear the proclamation?  COSTARD. I do confess much of the hearing it, but little of the marking of it.  KING. It was proclaimed a year’s imprisonment to be taken with a wench.  COSTARD. I was taken with none, sir. I was taken with a damsel.  KING. Well, it was proclaimed “damsel”.  COSTARD. This was no damsel neither, sir; she was a virgin.  KING. It is so varied too, for it was proclaimed “virgin”.  COSTARD. If it were, I deny her virginity. I was taken with a maid.  KING. This maid will not serve your turn, sir.  COSTARD. This maid will serve my turn, sir.  KING. Sir, I will pronounce your sentence: you shall fast a week with bran and water.  COSTARD. I had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge.  KING. And Don Armado shall be your keeper. My Lord Berowne, see him delivered o’er; And go we, lords, to put in practice that Which each to other hath so strongly sworn.  [_Exeunt King, Longaville and Dumaine._]  BEROWNE. I’ll lay my head to any good man’s hat These oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn. Sirrah, come on.  COSTARD. I suffer for the truth, sir; for true it is I was taken with Jaquenetta, and Jaquenetta is a true girl. And therefore welcome the sour cup of prosperity! Affliction may one day smile again, and till then, sit thee down, sorrow.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. The park  Enter Armado and Moth, his Page.  ARMADO. Boy, what sign is it when a man of great spirit grows melancholy?  MOTH. A great sign, sir, that he will look sad.  ARMADO. Why, sadness is one and the selfsame thing, dear imp.  MOTH. No, no, O Lord, sir, no.  ARMADO. How canst thou part sadness and melancholy, my tender juvenal?  MOTH. By a familiar demonstration of the working, my tough signior.  ARMADO. Why tough signior? Why tough signior?  MOTH. Why tender juvenal? Why tender juvenal?  ARMADO. I spoke it, tender juvenal, as a congruent epitheton appertaining to thy young days, which we may nominate tender.  MOTH. And I, tough signior, as an appertinent title to your old time, which we may name tough.  ARMADO. Pretty and apt.  MOTH. How mean you, sir? I pretty and my saying apt, or I apt, and my saying pretty?  ARMADO. Thou pretty, because little.  MOTH. Little pretty, because little. Wherefore apt?  ARMADO. And therefore apt, because quick.  MOTH. Speak you this in my praise, master?  ARMADO. In thy condign praise.  MOTH. I will praise an eel with the same praise.  ARMADO. What, that an eel is ingenious?  MOTH. That an eel is quick.  ARMADO. I do say thou art quick in answers. Thou heat’st my blood.  MOTH. I am answered, sir.  ARMADO. I love not to be crossed.  MOTH. [_Aside_.] He speaks the mere contrary; crosses love not him.  ARMADO. I have promised to study three years with the Duke.  MOTH. You may do it in an hour, sir.  ARMADO. Impossible.  MOTH. How many is one thrice told?  ARMADO. I am ill at reckoning. It fitteth the spirit of a tapster.  MOTH. You are a gentleman and a gamester, sir.  ARMADO. I confess both. They are both the varnish of a complete man.  MOTH. Then I am sure you know how much the gross sum of deuce-ace amounts to.  ARMADO. It doth amount to one more than two.  MOTH. Which the base vulgar do call three.  ARMADO. True.  MOTH. Why, sir, is this such a piece of study? Now here’s three studied ere ye’ll thrice wink. And how easy it is to put “years” to the word “three”, and study three years in two words, the dancing horse will tell you.  ARMADO. A most fine figure!  MOTH. [_Aside_.] To prove you a cipher.  ARMADO. I will hereupon confess I am in love; and as it is base for a soldier to love, so am I in love with a base wench. If drawing my sword against the humour of affection would deliver me from the reprobate thought of it, I would take desire prisoner, and ransom him to any French courtier for a new-devised curtsy. I think scorn to sigh; methinks I should outswear Cupid. Comfort me, boy. What great men have been in love?  MOTH. Hercules, master.  ARMADO. Most sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy, name more; and, sweet my child, let them be men of good repute and carriage.  MOTH. Samson, master. He was a man of good carriage, great carriage, for he carried the town gates on his back like a porter, and he was in love.  ARMADO. O well-knit Samson, strong-jointed Samson! I do excel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst me in carrying gates. I am in love too. Who was Samson’s love, my dear Moth?  MOTH. A woman, master.  ARMADO. Of what complexion?  MOTH. Of all the four, or the three, or the two, or one of the four.  ARMADO. Tell me precisely of what complexion.  MOTH. Of the sea-water green, sir.  ARMADO. Is that one of the four complexions?  MOTH. As I have read, sir; and the best of them too.  ARMADO. Green indeed is the colour of lovers. But to have a love of that colour, methinks Samson had small reason for it. He surely affected her for her wit.  MOTH. It was so, sir, for she had a green wit.  ARMADO. My love is most immaculate white and red.  MOTH. Most maculate thoughts, master, are masked under such colours.  ARMADO. Define, define, well-educated infant.  MOTH. My father’s wit and my mother’s tongue assist me!  ARMADO. Sweet invocation of a child, most pretty, and pathetical!  MOTH.   If she be made of white and red,      Her faults will ne’er be known;   For blushing cheeks by faults are bred,      And fears by pale white shown.   Then if she fear, or be to blame,      By this you shall not know,   For still her cheeks possess the same      Which native she doth owe. A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of white and red.  ARMADO. Is there not a ballad, boy, of the King and the Beggar?  MOTH. The world was very guilty of such a ballad some three ages since, but I think now ’tis not to be found; or if it were, it would neither serve for the writing nor the tune.  ARMADO. I will have that subject newly writ o’er, that I may example my digression by some mighty precedent. Boy, I do love that country girl that I took in the park with the rational hind Costard. She deserves well.  MOTH. [_Aside_.] To be whipped: and yet a better love than my master.  ARMADO. Sing, boy. My spirit grows heavy in love.  MOTH. And that’s great marvel, loving a light wench.  ARMADO. I say, sing.  MOTH. Forbear till this company be past.  Enter Costard the Clown, Dull the Constable and Jaquenetta a Wench.  DULL. Sir, the Duke’s pleasure is that you keep Costard safe; and you must suffer him to take no delight, nor no penance, but he must fast three days a week. For this damsel, I must keep her at the park. She is allowed for the dey-woman. Fare you well.  ARMADO. I do betray myself with blushing.—Maid.  JAQUENETTA. Man.  ARMADO. I will visit thee at the lodge.  JAQUENETTA. That’s hereby.  ARMADO. I know where it is situate.  JAQUENETTA. Lord, how wise you are!  ARMADO. I will tell thee wonders.  JAQUENETTA. With that face?  ARMADO. I love thee.  JAQUENETTA. So I heard you say.  ARMADO. And so, farewell.  JAQUENETTA. Fair weather after you!  DULL. Come, Jaquenetta, away.  [_Exeunt Dull and Jaquenetta._]  ARMADO. Villain, thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou be pardoned.  COSTARD. Well, sir, I hope when I do it I shall do it on a full stomach.  ARMADO. Thou shalt be heavily punished.  COSTARD. I am more bound to you than your fellows, for they are but lightly rewarded.  ARMADO. Take away this villain. Shut him up.  MOTH. Come, you transgressing slave, away!  COSTARD. Let me not be pent up, sir. I will fast being loose.  MOTH. No, sir, that were fast and loose. Thou shalt to prison.  COSTARD. Well, if ever I do see the merry days of desolation that I have seen, some shall see.  MOTH. What shall some see?  COSTARD. Nay, nothing, Master Moth, but what they look upon. It is not for prisoners to be too silent in their words, and therefore I will say nothing. I thank God I have as little patience as another man, and therefore I can be quiet.  [_Exeunt Moth and Costard._]  ARMADO. I do affect the very ground, which is base, where her shoe, which is baser, guided by her foot, which is basest, doth tread. I shall be forsworn, which is a great argument of falsehood, if I love. And how can that be true love which is falsely attempted? Love is a familiar; Love is a devil. There is no evil angel but Love. Yet was Samson so tempted, and he had an excellent strength; yet was Solomon so seduced, and he had a very good wit. Cupid’s butt-shaft is too hard for Hercules’ club, and therefore too much odds for a Spaniard’s rapier. The first and second cause will not serve my turn; the _passado_ he respects not, the _duello_ he regards not. His disgrace is to be called boy, but his glory is to subdue men. Adieu, valour; rust, rapier; be still, drum, for your manager is in love. Yea, he loveth. Assist me, some extemporal god of rhyme, for I am sure I shall turn sonnet. Devise, wit; write, pen; for I am for whole volumes in folio.  [_Exit._]
  ACT II  SCENE I. The King of Navarre’s park. A pavilion and tents at a distance
  ACT III  SCENE I. The King of Navarre’s park
Enter Armado the Braggart and Moth his Boy.  ARMADO. Warble, child, make passionate my sense of hearing.  MOTH. [_Singing_.] Concolinel.  ARMADO. Sweet air! Go, tenderness of years, take this key, give enlargement to the swain, bring him festinately hither. I must employ him in a letter to my love.  MOTH. Master, will you win your love with a French brawl?  ARMADO. How meanest thou? Brawling in French?  MOTH. No, my complete master; but to jig off a tune at the tongue’s end, canary to it with your feet, humour it with turning up your eyelids, sigh a note and sing a note, sometime through the throat, as if you swallowed love with singing love, sometime through the nose, as if you snuffed up love by smelling love; with your hat penthouse-like o’er the shop of your eyes, with your arms crossed on your thin-belly doublet like a rabbit on a spit; or your hands in your pocket like a man after the old painting; and keep not too long in one tune, but a snip and away. These are compliments, these are humours; these betray nice wenches that would be betrayed without these; and make them men of note—do you note me?—that most are affected to these.  ARMADO. How hast thou purchased this experience?  MOTH. By my penny of observation.  ARMADO. But O—but O—  MOTH. “The hobby-horse is forgot.”  ARMADO. Call’st thou my love “hobby-horse”?  MOTH. No, master. The hobby-horse is but a colt, and your love perhaps a hackney. But have you forgot your love?  ARMADO. Almost I had.  MOTH. Negligent student! Learn her by heart.  ARMADO. By heart and in heart, boy.  MOTH. And out of heart, master. All those three I will prove.  ARMADO. What wilt thou prove?  MOTH. A man, if I live; and this, “by, in, and without,” upon the instant: “by” heart you love her, because your heart cannot come by her; “in” heart you love her, because your heart is in love with her; and “out” of heart you love her, being out of heart that you cannot enjoy her.  ARMADO. I am all these three.  MOTH. And three times as much more, and yet nothing at all.  ARMADO. Fetch hither the swain. He must carry me a letter.  MOTH. A message well sympathized: a horse to be ambassador for an ass.  ARMADO. Ha, ha, what sayest thou?  MOTH. Marry, sir, you must send the ass upon the horse, for he is very slow-gaited. But I go.  ARMADO. The way is but short. Away!  MOTH. As swift as lead, sir.  ARMADO. The meaning, pretty ingenious? Is not lead a metal heavy, dull, and slow?  MOTH. _Minime_, honest master; or rather, master, no.  ARMADO. I say lead is slow.  MOTH. You are too swift, sir, to say so. Is that lead slow which is fired from a gun?  ARMADO. Sweet smoke of rhetoric! He reputes me a cannon; and the bullet, that’s he. I shoot thee at the swain.  MOTH. Thump then, and I flee.  [_Exit._]  ARMADO. A most acute juvenal, voluble and free of grace! By thy favour, sweet welkin, I must sigh in thy face. Most rude melancholy, valour gives thee place. My herald is returned.  Enter Moth and Costard.  MOTH. A wonder, master! Here’s a costard broken in a shin.  ARMADO. Some enigma, some riddle. Come, thy _l’envoi_ begin.  COSTARD. No egma, no riddle, no _l’envoi_, no salve in the mail, sir. O, sir, plantain, a plain plantain! No _l’envoi_, no _l’envoi_, no salve, sir, but a plantain.  ARMADO. By virtue, thou enforcest laughter; thy silly thought, my spleen; the heaving of my lungs provokes me to ridiculous smiling. O, pardon me, my stars! Doth the inconsiderate take _salve_ for _l’envoi_, and the word _l’envoi_ for a _salve?_  MOTH. Do the wise think them other? Is not _l’envoi_ a _salve?_  ARMADO. No, page; it is an epilogue or discourse to make plain Some obscure precedence that hath tofore been sain. I will example it:     The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee     Were still at odds, being but three. There’s the moral. Now the _l’envoi_.  MOTH. I will add the _l’envoi_. Say the moral again.  ARMADO.     The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee     Were still at odds, being but three.  MOTH.     Until the goose came out of door,     And stayed the odds by adding four. Now will I begin your moral, and do you follow with my _l’envoi_.     The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee     Were still at odds, being but three.  ARMADO.     Until the goose came out of door,     Staying the odds by adding four.  MOTH. A good _l’envoi_, ending in the goose. Would you desire more?  COSTARD. The boy hath sold him a bargain, a goose, that’s flat. Sir, your pennyworth is good, an your goose be fat. To sell a bargain well is as cunning as fast and loose. Let me see: a fat _l’envoi_—ay, that’s a fat goose.  ARMADO. Come hither, come hither. How did this argument begin?  MOTH. By saying that a costard was broken in a shin. Then called you for the _l’envoi_.  COSTARD. True, and I for a plantain. Thus came your argument in. Then the boy’s fat _l’envoi_, the goose that you bought; and he ended the market.  ARMADO. But tell me, how was there a costard broken in a shin?  MOTH. I will tell you sensibly.  COSTARD. Thou hast no feeling of it, Moth. I will speak that _l’envoi_.     I, Costard, running out, that was safely within,     Fell over the threshold and broke my shin.  ARMADO. We will talk no more of this matter.  COSTARD. Till there be more matter in the shin.  ARMADO. Sirrah Costard, I will enfranchise thee.  COSTARD. O, marry me to one Frances! I smell some _l’envoi_, some goose, in this.  ARMADO. By my sweet soul, I mean setting thee at liberty, enfreedoming thy person. Thou wert immured, restrained, captivated, bound.  COSTARD. True, true; and now you will be my purgation, and let me loose.  ARMADO. I give thee thy liberty, set thee from durance, and, in lieu thereof, impose on thee nothing but this: [_Giving him a letter_.] bear this significant to the country maid Jaquenetta. [_Giving money_.] There is remuneration for the best ward of mine honour is rewarding my dependents. Moth, follow.  [_Exit._]  MOTH. Like the sequel, I. Signior Costard, adieu.  [_Exit Moth._]  COSTARD. My sweet ounce of man’s flesh, my incony Jew! Now will I look to his remuneration. “Remuneration”! O, that’s the Latin word for three farthings. Three farthings—_remuneration_. “What’s the price of this inkle?” “One penny.” “No, I’ll give you a remuneration.” Why, it carries it! _Remuneration_. Why, it is a fairer name than French crown. I will never buy and sell out of this word.  Enter Berowne.  BEROWNE. My good knave Costard, exceedingly well met.  COSTARD. Pray you, sir, how much carnation ribbon may a man buy for a remuneration?  BEROWNE. What is a remuneration?  COSTARD. Marry, sir, halfpenny farthing.  BEROWNE. Why, then, three-farthing worth of silk.  COSTARD. I thank your worship. God be wi’ you.  BEROWNE. Stay, slave. I must employ thee. As thou wilt win my favour, good my knave, Do one thing for me that I shall entreat.  COSTARD. When would you have it done, sir?  BEROWNE. This afternoon.  COSTARD. Well, I will do it, sir. Fare you well.  BEROWNE. Thou knowest not what it is.  COSTARD. I shall know, sir, when I have done it.  BEROWNE. Why, villain, thou must know first.  COSTARD. I will come to your worship tomorrow morning.  BEROWNE. It must be done this afternoon. Hark, slave, it is but this: The Princess comes to hunt here in the park, And in her train there is a gentle lady; When tongues speak sweetly, then they name her name, And Rosaline they call her. Ask for her And to her white hand see thou do commend This sealed-up counsel.  [_Gives him money._]  There’s thy guerdon. Go.  COSTARD. Gardon, O sweet gardon! Better than remuneration, a ’levenpence farthing better. Most sweet gardon! I will do it, sir, in print. Gardon! Remuneration!  [_Exit._]  BEROWNE. And I, forsooth, in love! I, that have been love’s whip, A very beadle to a humorous sigh, A critic, nay, a night-watch constable, A domineering pedant o’er the boy, Than whom no mortal so magnificent! This wimpled, whining, purblind, wayward boy, This Signior Junior, giant-dwarf, Dan Cupid, Regent of love-rhymes, lord of folded arms, Th’ anointed sovereign of sighs and groans, Liege of all loiterers and malcontents, Dread prince of plackets, king of codpieces, Sole imperator, and great general Of trotting paritors—O my little heart! And I to be a corporal of his field And wear his colours like a tumbler’s hoop! What? I love, I sue, I seek a wife? A woman, that is like a German clock, Still a-repairing, ever out of frame, And never going aright, being a watch, But being watched that it may still go right! Nay, to be perjured, which is worst of all; And, among three, to love the worst of all, A whitely wanton with a velvet brow, With two pitch-balls stuck in her face for eyes; Ay, and, by heaven, one that will do the deed Though Argus were her eunuch and her guard. And I to sigh for her, to watch for her, To pray for her! Go to, it is a plague That Cupid will impose for my neglect Of his almighty dreadful little might. Well, I will love, write, sigh, pray, sue, and groan. Some men must love my lady, and some Joan.  [_Exit._]

  ACT I  SCENE I. An open Place.
ACT II  SCENE I. Inverness. Court within the Castle.   Enter Banquo and Fleance with a torch before him.  BANQUO. How goes the night, boy?  FLEANCE. The moon is down; I have not heard the clock.  BANQUO. And she goes down at twelve.  FLEANCE. I take’t, ’tis later, sir.  BANQUO. Hold, take my sword.—There’s husbandry in heaven; Their candles are all out. Take thee that too. A heavy summons lies like lead upon me, And yet I would not sleep. Merciful powers, Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature Gives way to in repose!   Enter Macbeth and a Servant with a torch.  Give me my sword.—Who’s there?  MACBETH. A friend.  BANQUO. What, sir, not yet at rest? The King’s abed: He hath been in unusual pleasure and Sent forth great largess to your offices. This diamond he greets your wife withal, By the name of most kind hostess, and shut up In measureless content.  MACBETH. Being unprepar’d, Our will became the servant to defect, Which else should free have wrought.  BANQUO. All’s well. I dreamt last night of the three Weird Sisters: To you they have show’d some truth.  MACBETH. I think not of them: Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve, We would spend it in some words upon that business, If you would grant the time.  BANQUO. At your kind’st leisure.  MACBETH. If you shall cleave to my consent, when ’tis, It shall make honour for you.  BANQUO. So I lose none In seeking to augment it, but still keep My bosom franchis’d, and allegiance clear, I shall be counsell’d.  MACBETH. Good repose the while!  BANQUO. Thanks, sir: the like to you.   [_Exeunt Banquo and Fleance._]  MACBETH. Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready, She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed.   [_Exit Servant._]  Is this a dagger which I see before me, The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee:— I have thee not, and yet I see thee still. Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible To feeling as to sight? or art thou but A dagger of the mind, a false creation, Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain? I see thee yet, in form as palpable As this which now I draw. Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going; And such an instrument I was to use. Mine eyes are made the fools o’ the other senses, Or else worth all the rest: I see thee still; And on thy blade and dudgeon, gouts of blood, Which was not so before.—There’s no such thing. It is the bloody business which informs Thus to mine eyes.—Now o’er the one half-world Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse The curtain’d sleep. Witchcraft celebrates Pale Hecate’s off’rings; and wither’d murder, Alarum’d by his sentinel, the wolf, Whose howl’s his watch, thus with his stealthy pace, With Tarquin’s ravishing strides, towards his design Moves like a ghost.—Thou sure and firm-set earth, Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear Thy very stones prate of my whereabout, And take the present horror from the time, Which now suits with it.—Whiles I threat, he lives. Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.   [_A bell rings._]  I go, and it is done. The bell invites me. Hear it not, Duncan, for it is a knell That summons thee to heaven or to hell.   [_Exit._]  SCENE II. The same.   Enter Lady Macbeth.  LADY MACBETH. That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold: What hath quench’d them hath given me fire.—Hark!—Peace! It was the owl that shriek’d, the fatal bellman, Which gives the stern’st good night. He is about it. The doors are open; and the surfeited grooms Do mock their charge with snores: I have drugg’d their possets, That death and nature do contend about them, Whether they live or die.  MACBETH. [_Within._] Who’s there?—what, ho!  LADY MACBETH. Alack! I am afraid they have awak’d, And ’tis not done. Th’ attempt and not the deed Confounds us.—Hark!—I laid their daggers ready; He could not miss ’em.—Had he not resembled My father as he slept, I had done’t.—My husband!   Enter Macbeth.  MACBETH. I have done the deed.—Didst thou not hear a noise?  LADY MACBETH. I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry. Did not you speak?  MACBETH. When?  LADY MACBETH. Now.  MACBETH. As I descended?  LADY MACBETH. Ay.  MACBETH. Hark!—Who lies i’ th’ second chamber?  LADY MACBETH. Donalbain.  MACBETH. This is a sorry sight.   [_Looking on his hands._]  LADY MACBETH. A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.  MACBETH. There’s one did laugh in’s sleep, and one cried, “Murder!” That they did wake each other: I stood and heard them. But they did say their prayers, and address’d them Again to sleep.  LADY MACBETH. There are two lodg’d together.  MACBETH. One cried, “God bless us!” and, “Amen,” the other, As they had seen me with these hangman’s hands. List’ning their fear, I could not say “Amen,” When they did say, “God bless us.”  LADY MACBETH. Consider it not so deeply.  MACBETH. But wherefore could not I pronounce “Amen”? I had most need of blessing, and “Amen” Stuck in my throat.  LADY MACBETH. These deeds must not be thought After these ways; so, it will make us mad.  MACBETH. Methought I heard a voice cry, “Sleep no more! Macbeth does murder sleep,”—the innocent sleep; Sleep that knits up the ravell’d sleave of care, The death of each day’s life, sore labour’s bath, Balm of hurt minds, great nature’s second course, Chief nourisher in life’s feast.  LADY MACBETH. What do you mean?  MACBETH. Still it cried, “Sleep no more!” to all the house: “Glamis hath murder’d sleep, and therefore Cawdor Shall sleep no more. Macbeth shall sleep no more!”  LADY MACBETH. Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane, You do unbend your noble strength to think So brainsickly of things. Go get some water, And wash this filthy witness from your hand.— Why did you bring these daggers from the place? They must lie there: go carry them, and smear The sleepy grooms with blood.  MACBETH. I’ll go no more: I am afraid to think what I have done; Look on’t again I dare not.  LADY MACBETH. Infirm of purpose! Give me the daggers. The sleeping and the dead Are but as pictures. ’Tis the eye of childhood That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed, I’ll gild the faces of the grooms withal, For it must seem their guilt.   [_Exit. Knocking within._]  MACBETH. Whence is that knocking? How is’t with me, when every noise appals me? What hands are here? Ha, they pluck out mine eyes! Will all great Neptune’s ocean wash this blood Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather The multitudinous seas incarnadine, Making the green one red.   Enter Lady Macbeth.  LADY MACBETH. My hands are of your color, but I shame To wear a heart so white. [_Knocking within._] I hear knocking At the south entry:—retire we to our chamber. A little water clears us of this deed: How easy is it then! Your constancy Hath left you unattended.—[_Knocking within._] Hark, more knocking. Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us And show us to be watchers. Be not lost So poorly in your thoughts.  MACBETH. To know my deed, ’twere best not know myself. [_Knocking within._] Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst!   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. The same.   Enter a Porter. Knocking within.  PORTER. Here’s a knocking indeed! If a man were porter of hell gate, he should have old turning the key. [_Knocking._] Knock, knock, knock. Who’s there, i’ th’ name of Belzebub? Here’s a farmer that hanged himself on the expectation of plenty: come in time; have napkins enow about you; here you’ll sweat for’t. [_Knocking._] Knock, knock! Who’s there, i’ th’ other devil’s name? Faith, here’s an equivocator, that could swear in both the scales against either scale, who committed treason enough for God’s sake, yet could not equivocate to heaven: O, come in, equivocator. [_Knocking._] Knock, knock, knock! Who’s there? Faith, here’s an English tailor come hither, for stealing out of a French hose: come in, tailor; here you may roast your goose. [_Knocking._] Knock, knock. Never at quiet! What are you?—But this place is too cold for hell. I’ll devil-porter it no further: I had thought to have let in some of all professions, that go the primrose way to th’ everlasting bonfire. [_Knocking._] Anon, anon! I pray you, remember the porter.   [_Opens the gate._]   Enter Macduff and Lennox.  MACDUFF. Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed, That you do lie so late?  PORTER. Faith, sir, we were carousing till the second cock; and drink, sir, is a great provoker of three things.  MACDUFF. What three things does drink especially provoke?  PORTER. Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes and unprovokes; it provokes the desire, but it takes away the performance. Therefore much drink may be said to be an equivocator with lechery: it makes him, and it mars him; it sets him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him, and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him in a sleep, and giving him the lie, leaves him.  MACDUFF. I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.  PORTER. That it did, sir, i’ the very throat on me; but I requited him for his lie; and (I think) being too strong for him, though he took up my legs sometime, yet I made a shift to cast him.  MACDUFF. Is thy master stirring?   Enter Macbeth.  Our knocking has awak’d him; here he comes.  LENNOX. Good morrow, noble sir!  MACBETH. Good morrow, both!  MACDUFF. Is the King stirring, worthy thane?  MACBETH. Not yet.  MACDUFF. He did command me to call timely on him. I have almost slipp’d the hour.  MACBETH. I’ll bring you to him.  MACDUFF. I know this is a joyful trouble to you; But yet ’tis one.  MACBETH. The labour we delight in physics pain. This is the door.  MACDUFF. I’ll make so bold to call. For ’tis my limited service.   [_Exit Macduff._]  LENNOX. Goes the King hence today?  MACBETH. He does. He did appoint so.  LENNOX. The night has been unruly: where we lay, Our chimneys were blown down and, as they say, Lamentings heard i’ th’ air, strange screams of death, And prophesying, with accents terrible, Of dire combustion and confus’d events, New hatch’d to the woeful time. The obscure bird Clamour’d the live-long night. Some say the earth Was feverous, and did shake.  MACBETH. ’Twas a rough night.  LENNOX. My young remembrance cannot parallel A fellow to it.   Enter Macduff.  MACDUFF. O horror, horror, horror! Tongue nor heart cannot conceive nor name thee!  MACBETH, LENNOX. What’s the matter?  MACDUFF. Confusion now hath made his masterpiece! Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope The Lord’s anointed temple, and stole thence The life o’ th’ building.  MACBETH. What is’t you say? the life?  LENNOX. Mean you his majesty?  MACDUFF. Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight With a new Gorgon. Do not bid me speak. See, and then speak yourselves.   [_Exeunt Macbeth and Lennox._]  Awake, awake!— Ring the alarum bell.—Murder and treason! Banquo and Donalbain! Malcolm! awake! Shake off this downy sleep, death’s counterfeit, And look on death itself! Up, up, and see The great doom’s image. Malcolm! Banquo! As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites To countenance this horror!   [_Alarum-bell rings._]   Enter Lady Macbeth.  LADY MACBETH. What’s the business, That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley The sleepers of the house? Speak, speak!  MACDUFF. O gentle lady, ’Tis not for you to hear what I can speak: The repetition, in a woman’s ear, Would murder as it fell.   Enter Banquo.  O Banquo, Banquo! Our royal master’s murder’d!  LADY MACBETH. Woe, alas! What, in our house?  BANQUO. Too cruel anywhere.— Dear Duff, I pr’ythee, contradict thyself, And say it is not so.   Enter Macbeth and Lennox with Ross.  MACBETH. Had I but died an hour before this chance, I had liv’d a blessed time; for, from this instant There’s nothing serious in mortality. All is but toys: renown and grace is dead; The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees Is left this vault to brag of.   Enter Malcolm and Donalbain.  DONALBAIN. What is amiss?  MACBETH. You are, and do not know’t: The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood Is stopp’d; the very source of it is stopp’d.  MACDUFF. Your royal father’s murder’d.  MALCOLM. O, by whom?  LENNOX. Those of his chamber, as it seem’d, had done’t: Their hands and faces were all badg’d with blood; So were their daggers, which, unwip’d, we found Upon their pillows. They star’d, and were distracted; No man’s life was to be trusted with them.  MACBETH. O, yet I do repent me of my fury, That I did kill them.  MACDUFF. Wherefore did you so?  MACBETH. Who can be wise, amaz’d, temperate, and furious, Loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man: Th’ expedition of my violent love Outrun the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan, His silver skin lac’d with his golden blood; And his gash’d stabs look’d like a breach in nature For ruin’s wasteful entrance: there, the murderers, Steep’d in the colours of their trade, their daggers Unmannerly breech’d with gore. Who could refrain, That had a heart to love, and in that heart Courage to make’s love known?  LADY MACBETH. Help me hence, ho!  MACDUFF. Look to the lady.  MALCOLM. Why do we hold our tongues, That most may claim this argument for ours?  DONALBAIN. What should be spoken here, where our fate, Hid in an auger hole, may rush, and seize us? Let’s away. Our tears are not yet brew’d.  MALCOLM. Nor our strong sorrow Upon the foot of motion.  BANQUO. Look to the lady:—   [_Lady Macbeth is carried out._]  And when we have our naked frailties hid, That suffer in exposure, let us meet, And question this most bloody piece of work To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us: In the great hand of God I stand; and thence Against the undivulg’d pretence I fight Of treasonous malice.  MACDUFF. And so do I.  ALL. So all.  MACBETH. Let’s briefly put on manly readiness, And meet i’ th’ hall together.  ALL. Well contented.   [_Exeunt all but Malcolm and Donalbain._]  MALCOLM. What will you do? Let’s not consort with them: To show an unfelt sorrow is an office Which the false man does easy. I’ll to England.  DONALBAIN. To Ireland, I. Our separated fortune Shall keep us both the safer. Where we are, There’s daggers in men’s smiles: the near in blood, The nearer bloody.  MALCOLM. This murderous shaft that’s shot Hath not yet lighted; and our safest way Is to avoid the aim. Therefore to horse; And let us not be dainty of leave-taking, But shift away. There’s warrant in that theft Which steals itself, when there’s no mercy left.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IV. The same. Without the Castle.   Enter Ross and an Old Man.  OLD MAN. Threescore and ten I can remember well, Within the volume of which time I have seen Hours dreadful and things strange, but this sore night Hath trifled former knowings.  ROSS. Ha, good father, Thou seest the heavens, as troubled with man’s act, Threatens his bloody stage: by the clock ’tis day, And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp. Is’t night’s predominance, or the day’s shame, That darkness does the face of earth entomb, When living light should kiss it?  OLD MAN. ’Tis unnatural, Even like the deed that’s done. On Tuesday last, A falcon, towering in her pride of place, Was by a mousing owl hawk’d at and kill’d.  ROSS. And Duncan’s horses (a thing most strange and certain) Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race, Turn’d wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out, Contending ’gainst obedience, as they would make War with mankind.  OLD MAN. ’Tis said they eat each other.  ROSS. They did so; to the amazement of mine eyes, That look’d upon’t. Here comes the good Macduff.   Enter Macduff.  How goes the world, sir, now?  MACDUFF. Why, see you not?  ROSS. Is’t known who did this more than bloody deed?  MACDUFF. Those that Macbeth hath slain.  ROSS. Alas, the day! What good could they pretend?  MACDUFF. They were suborn’d. Malcolm and Donalbain, the King’s two sons, Are stol’n away and fled; which puts upon them Suspicion of the deed.  ROSS. ’Gainst nature still: Thriftless ambition, that will ravin up Thine own life’s means!—Then ’tis most like The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.  MACDUFF. He is already nam’d; and gone to Scone To be invested.  ROSS. Where is Duncan’s body?  MACDUFF. Carried to Colmekill, The sacred storehouse of his predecessors, And guardian of their bones.  ROSS. Will you to Scone?  MACDUFF. No, cousin, I’ll to Fife.  ROSS. Well, I will thither.  MACDUFF. Well, may you see things well done there. Adieu! Lest our old robes sit easier than our new!  ROSS. Farewell, father.  OLD MAN. God’s benison go with you; and with those That would make good of bad, and friends of foes!   [_Exeunt._]
ACT III  SCENE I. Forres. A Room in the Palace.   Enter Banquo.  BANQUO. Thou hast it now, King, Cawdor, Glamis, all, As the Weird Women promis’d; and, I fear, Thou play’dst most foully for’t; yet it was said It should not stand in thy posterity; But that myself should be the root and father Of many kings. If there come truth from them (As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine) Why, by the verities on thee made good, May they not be my oracles as well, And set me up in hope? But hush; no more.   Sennet sounded. Enter Macbeth as King, Lady Macbeth as Queen; Lennox,  Ross, Lords, and Attendants.  MACBETH. Here’s our chief guest.  LADY MACBETH. If he had been forgotten, It had been as a gap in our great feast, And all-thing unbecoming.  MACBETH. Tonight we hold a solemn supper, sir, And I’ll request your presence.  BANQUO. Let your Highness Command upon me, to the which my duties Are with a most indissoluble tie For ever knit.  MACBETH. Ride you this afternoon?  BANQUO. Ay, my good lord.  MACBETH. We should have else desir’d your good advice (Which still hath been both grave and prosperous) In this day’s council; but we’ll take tomorrow. Is’t far you ride?  BANQUO. As far, my lord, as will fill up the time ’Twixt this and supper: go not my horse the better, I must become a borrower of the night, For a dark hour or twain.  MACBETH. Fail not our feast.  BANQUO. My lord, I will not.  MACBETH. We hear our bloody cousins are bestow’d In England and in Ireland; not confessing Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers With strange invention. But of that tomorrow, When therewithal we shall have cause of state Craving us jointly. Hie you to horse: adieu, Till you return at night. Goes Fleance with you?  BANQUO. Ay, my good lord: our time does call upon’s.  MACBETH. I wish your horses swift and sure of foot; And so I do commend you to their backs. Farewell.—   [_Exit Banquo._]  Let every man be master of his time Till seven at night; to make society The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself Till supper time alone: while then, God be with you.   [_Exeunt Lady Macbeth, Lords, &c._]  Sirrah, a word with you. Attend those men Our pleasure?  SERVANT. They are, my lord, without the palace gate.  MACBETH. Bring them before us.   [_Exit Servant._]  To be thus is nothing, But to be safely thus. Our fears in Banquo Stick deep, and in his royalty of nature Reigns that which would be fear’d: ’tis much he dares; And, to that dauntless temper of his mind, He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour To act in safety. There is none but he Whose being I do fear: and under him My genius is rebuk’d; as, it is said, Mark Antony’s was by Caesar. He chid the sisters When first they put the name of king upon me, And bade them speak to him; then, prophet-like, They hail’d him father to a line of kings: Upon my head they plac’d a fruitless crown, And put a barren sceptre in my gripe, Thence to be wrench’d with an unlineal hand, No son of mine succeeding. If’t be so, For Banquo’s issue have I fil’d my mind; For them the gracious Duncan have I murder’d; Put rancours in the vessel of my peace Only for them; and mine eternal jewel Given to the common enemy of man, To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings! Rather than so, come, fate, into the list, And champion me to th’ utterance!—Who’s there?—   Enter Servant with two Murderers.  Now go to the door, and stay there till we call.   [_Exit Servant._]  Was it not yesterday we spoke together?  FIRST MURDERER. It was, so please your Highness.  MACBETH. Well then, now Have you consider’d of my speeches? Know That it was he, in the times past, which held you So under fortune, which you thought had been Our innocent self? This I made good to you In our last conference, pass’d in probation with you How you were borne in hand, how cross’d, the instruments, Who wrought with them, and all things else that might To half a soul and to a notion craz’d Say, “Thus did Banquo.”  FIRST MURDERER. You made it known to us.  MACBETH. I did so; and went further, which is now Our point of second meeting. Do you find Your patience so predominant in your nature, That you can let this go? Are you so gospell’d, To pray for this good man and for his issue, Whose heavy hand hath bow’d you to the grave, And beggar’d yours forever?  FIRST MURDERER. We are men, my liege.  MACBETH. Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men; As hounds, and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs, Shoughs, water-rugs, and demi-wolves are clept All by the name of dogs: the valu’d file Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle, The housekeeper, the hunter, every one According to the gift which bounteous nature Hath in him clos’d; whereby he does receive Particular addition, from the bill That writes them all alike: and so of men. Now, if you have a station in the file, Not i’ th’ worst rank of manhood, say’t; And I will put that business in your bosoms, Whose execution takes your enemy off, Grapples you to the heart and love of us, Who wear our health but sickly in his life, Which in his death were perfect.  SECOND MURDERER. I am one, my liege, Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world Hath so incens’d that I am reckless what I do to spite the world.  FIRST MURDERER. And I another, So weary with disasters, tugg’d with fortune, That I would set my life on any chance, To mend it or be rid on’t.  MACBETH. Both of you Know Banquo was your enemy.  BOTH MURDERERS. True, my lord.  MACBETH. So is he mine; and in such bloody distance, That every minute of his being thrusts Against my near’st of life; and though I could With barefac’d power sweep him from my sight, And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not, For certain friends that are both his and mine, Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall Who I myself struck down: and thence it is That I to your assistance do make love, Masking the business from the common eye For sundry weighty reasons.  SECOND MURDERER. We shall, my lord, Perform what you command us.  FIRST MURDERER. Though our lives—  MACBETH. Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most, I will advise you where to plant yourselves, Acquaint you with the perfect spy o’ th’ time, The moment on’t; for’t must be done tonight And something from the palace; always thought That I require a clearness. And with him (To leave no rubs nor botches in the work) Fleance his son, that keeps him company, Whose absence is no less material to me Than is his father’s, must embrace the fate Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart. I’ll come to you anon.  BOTH MURDERERS. We are resolv’d, my lord.  MACBETH. I’ll call upon you straight: abide within.   [_Exeunt Murderers._]  It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul’s flight, If it find heaven, must find it out tonight.   [_Exit._]  SCENE II. The same. Another Room in the Palace.   Enter Lady Macbeth and a Servant.  LADY MACBETH. Is Banquo gone from court?  SERVANT. Ay, madam, but returns again tonight.  LADY MACBETH. Say to the King, I would attend his leisure For a few words.  SERVANT. Madam, I will.   [_Exit._]  LADY MACBETH. Naught’s had, all’s spent, Where our desire is got without content: ’Tis safer to be that which we destroy, Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.   Enter Macbeth.  How now, my lord, why do you keep alone, Of sorriest fancies your companions making, Using those thoughts which should indeed have died With them they think on? Things without all remedy Should be without regard: what’s done is done.  MACBETH. We have scorch’d the snake, not kill’d it. She’ll close, and be herself; whilst our poor malice Remains in danger of her former tooth. But let the frame of things disjoint, Both the worlds suffer, Ere we will eat our meal in fear, and sleep In the affliction of these terrible dreams That shake us nightly. Better be with the dead, Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace, Than on the torture of the mind to lie In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave; After life’s fitful fever he sleeps well; Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison, Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing Can touch him further.  LADY MACBETH. Come on, Gently my lord, sleek o’er your rugged looks; Be bright and jovial among your guests tonight.  MACBETH. So shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you. Let your remembrance apply to Banquo; Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue: Unsafe the while, that we Must lave our honours in these flattering streams, And make our faces vizards to our hearts, Disguising what they are.  LADY MACBETH. You must leave this.  MACBETH. O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife! Thou know’st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives.  LADY MACBETH. But in them nature’s copy’s not eterne.  MACBETH. There’s comfort yet; they are assailable. Then be thou jocund. Ere the bat hath flown His cloister’d flight, ere to black Hecate’s summons The shard-born beetle, with his drowsy hums, Hath rung night’s yawning peal, there shall be done A deed of dreadful note.  LADY MACBETH. What’s to be done?  MACBETH. Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck, Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night, Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day, And with thy bloody and invisible hand Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond Which keeps me pale!—Light thickens; and the crow Makes wing to th’ rooky wood. Good things of day begin to droop and drowse, Whiles night’s black agents to their preys do rouse. Thou marvell’st at my words: but hold thee still; Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill. So, pr’ythee, go with me.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. The same. A Park or Lawn, with a gate leading to the Palace.   Enter three Murderers.  FIRST MURDERER. But who did bid thee join with us?  THIRD MURDERER. Macbeth.  SECOND MURDERER. He needs not our mistrust; since he delivers Our offices and what we have to do To the direction just.  FIRST MURDERER. Then stand with us. The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day. Now spurs the lated traveller apace, To gain the timely inn; and near approaches The subject of our watch.  THIRD MURDERER. Hark! I hear horses.  BANQUO. [_Within._] Give us a light there, ho!  SECOND MURDERER. Then ’tis he; the rest That are within the note of expectation Already are i’ th’ court.  FIRST MURDERER. His horses go about.  THIRD MURDERER. Almost a mile; but he does usually, So all men do, from hence to the palace gate Make it their walk.   Enter Banquo and Fleance with a torch.  SECOND MURDERER. A light, a light!  THIRD MURDERER. ’Tis he.  FIRST MURDERER. Stand to’t.  BANQUO. It will be rain tonight.  FIRST MURDERER. Let it come down.   [_Assaults Banquo._]  BANQUO. O, treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly! Thou mayst revenge—O slave!   [_Dies. Fleance escapes._]  THIRD MURDERER. Who did strike out the light?  FIRST MURDERER. Was’t not the way?  THIRD MURDERER. There’s but one down: the son is fled.  SECOND MURDERER. We have lost best half of our affair.  FIRST MURDERER. Well, let’s away, and say how much is done.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IV. The same. A Room of state in the Palace.   A banquet prepared. Enter Macbeth, Lady Macbeth, Ross, Lennox, Lords  and Attendants.  MACBETH. You know your own degrees, sit down. At first And last the hearty welcome.  LORDS. Thanks to your Majesty.  MACBETH. Ourself will mingle with society, And play the humble host. Our hostess keeps her state; but, in best time, We will require her welcome.  LADY MACBETH. Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends; For my heart speaks they are welcome.   Enter first Murderer to the door.  MACBETH. See, they encounter thee with their hearts’ thanks. Both sides are even: here I’ll sit i’ th’ midst.  Be large in mirth; anon we’ll drink a measure The table round. There’s blood upon thy face.  MURDERER. ’Tis Banquo’s then.  MACBETH. ’Tis better thee without than he within. Is he dispatch’d?  MURDERER. My lord, his throat is cut. That I did for him.  MACBETH. Thou art the best o’ th’ cut-throats; Yet he’s good that did the like for Fleance: If thou didst it, thou art the nonpareil.  MURDERER. Most royal sir, Fleance is ’scap’d.  MACBETH. Then comes my fit again: I had else been perfect; Whole as the marble, founded as the rock, As broad and general as the casing air: But now I am cabin’d, cribb’d, confin’d, bound in To saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo’s safe?  MURDERER. Ay, my good lord. Safe in a ditch he bides, With twenty trenched gashes on his head; The least a death to nature.  MACBETH. Thanks for that. There the grown serpent lies; the worm that’s fled Hath nature that in time will venom breed, No teeth for th’ present.—Get thee gone; tomorrow We’ll hear, ourselves, again.   [_Exit Murderer._]  LADY MACBETH. My royal lord, You do not give the cheer: the feast is sold That is not often vouch’d, while ’tis a-making, ’Tis given with welcome. To feed were best at home; From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony; Meeting were bare without it.   The Ghost of Banquo rises, and sits in Macbeth’s place.  MACBETH. Sweet remembrancer!— Now, good digestion wait on appetite, And health on both!  LENNOX. May’t please your Highness sit.  MACBETH. Here had we now our country’s honour roof’d, Were the grac’d person of our Banquo present; Who may I rather challenge for unkindness Than pity for mischance!  ROSS. His absence, sir, Lays blame upon his promise. Please’t your Highness To grace us with your royal company?  MACBETH. The table’s full.  LENNOX. Here is a place reserv’d, sir.  MACBETH. Where?  LENNOX. Here, my good lord. What is’t that moves your Highness?  MACBETH. Which of you have done this?  LORDS. What, my good lord?  MACBETH. Thou canst not say I did it. Never shake Thy gory locks at me.  ROSS. Gentlemen, rise; his Highness is not well.  LADY MACBETH. Sit, worthy friends. My lord is often thus, And hath been from his youth: pray you, keep seat; The fit is momentary; upon a thought He will again be well. If much you note him, You shall offend him, and extend his passion. Feed, and regard him not.—Are you a man?  MACBETH. Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that Which might appal the devil.  LADY MACBETH. O proper stuff! This is the very painting of your fear: This is the air-drawn dagger which you said, Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws, and starts (Impostors to true fear), would well become A woman’s story at a winter’s fire, Authoris’d by her grandam. Shame itself! Why do you make such faces? When all’s done, You look but on a stool.  MACBETH. Pr’ythee, see there! Behold! look! lo! how say you? Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.— If charnel houses and our graves must send Those that we bury back, our monuments Shall be the maws of kites.   [_Ghost disappears._]  LADY MACBETH. What, quite unmann’d in folly?  MACBETH. If I stand here, I saw him.  LADY MACBETH. Fie, for shame!  MACBETH. Blood hath been shed ere now, i’ th’ olden time, Ere humane statute purg’d the gentle weal; Ay, and since too, murders have been perform’d Too terrible for the ear: the time has been, That, when the brains were out, the man would die, And there an end; but now they rise again, With twenty mortal murders on their crowns, And push us from our stools. This is more strange Than such a murder is.  LADY MACBETH. My worthy lord, Your noble friends do lack you.  MACBETH. I do forget.— Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends. I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing To those that know me. Come, love and health to all; Then I’ll sit down.—Give me some wine, fill full.— I drink to the general joy o’ th’ whole table, And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss: Would he were here.   Ghost rises again.  To all, and him, we thirst, And all to all.  LORDS. Our duties, and the pledge.  MACBETH. Avaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee! Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold; Thou hast no speculation in those eyes Which thou dost glare with!  LADY MACBETH. Think of this, good peers, But as a thing of custom: ’tis no other, Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.  MACBETH. What man dare, I dare: Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear, The arm’d rhinoceros, or th’ Hyrcan tiger; Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves Shall never tremble: or be alive again, And dare me to the desert with thy sword; If trembling I inhabit then, protest me The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow! Unreal mock’ry, hence!   [_Ghost disappears._]  Why, so;—being gone, I am a man again.—Pray you, sit still.  LADY MACBETH. You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting With most admir’d disorder.  MACBETH. Can such things be, And overcome us like a summer’s cloud, Without our special wonder? You make me strange Even to the disposition that I owe, When now I think you can behold such sights, And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks, When mine are blanch’d with fear.  ROSS. What sights, my lord?  LADY MACBETH. I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse; Question enrages him. At once, good night:— Stand not upon the order of your going, But go at once.  LENNOX. Good night; and better health Attend his Majesty!  LADY MACBETH. A kind good night to all!   [_Exeunt all Lords and Attendants._]  MACBETH. It will have blood, they say, blood will have blood. Stones have been known to move, and trees to speak; Augurs, and understood relations, have By magot-pies, and choughs, and rooks, brought forth The secret’st man of blood.—What is the night?  LADY MACBETH. Almost at odds with morning, which is which.  MACBETH. How say’st thou, that Macduff denies his person At our great bidding?  LADY MACBETH. Did you send to him, sir?  MACBETH. I hear it by the way; but I will send. There’s not a one of them but in his house I keep a servant fee’d. I will tomorrow (And betimes I will) to the Weird Sisters: More shall they speak; for now I am bent to know, By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good, All causes shall give way: I am in blood Stepp’d in so far that, should I wade no more, Returning were as tedious as go o’er. Strange things I have in head, that will to hand, Which must be acted ere they may be scann’d.  LADY MACBETH. You lack the season of all natures, sleep.  MACBETH. Come, we’ll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse Is the initiate fear that wants hard use. We are yet but young in deed.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE V. The heath.   Thunder. Enter the three Witches meeting Hecate.  FIRST WITCH. Why, how now, Hecate? you look angerly.  HECATE. Have I not reason, beldams as you are, Saucy and overbold? How did you dare To trade and traffic with Macbeth In riddles and affairs of death; And I, the mistress of your charms, The close contriver of all harms, Was never call’d to bear my part, Or show the glory of our art? And, which is worse, all you have done Hath been but for a wayward son, Spiteful and wrathful; who, as others do, Loves for his own ends, not for you. But make amends now: get you gone, And at the pit of Acheron Meet me i’ th’ morning: thither he Will come to know his destiny. Your vessels and your spells provide, Your charms, and everything beside. I am for th’ air; this night I’ll spend Unto a dismal and a fatal end. Great business must be wrought ere noon. Upon the corner of the moon There hangs a vap’rous drop profound; I’ll catch it ere it come to ground: And that, distill’d by magic sleights, Shall raise such artificial sprites, As, by the strength of their illusion, Shall draw him on to his confusion. He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear His hopes ’bove wisdom, grace, and fear. And you all know, security Is mortals’ chiefest enemy.   [_Music and song within, “Come away, come away” &c._]  Hark! I am call’d; my little spirit, see, Sits in a foggy cloud and stays for me.   [_Exit._]  FIRST WITCH. Come, let’s make haste; she’ll soon be back again.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE VI. Forres. A Room in the Palace.   Enter Lennox and another Lord.  LENNOX. My former speeches have but hit your thoughts, Which can interpret farther: only, I say, Thing’s have been strangely borne. The gracious Duncan Was pitied of Macbeth:—marry, he was dead:— And the right valiant Banquo walk’d too late; Whom, you may say, if’t please you, Fleance kill’d, For Fleance fled. Men must not walk too late. Who cannot want the thought, how monstrous It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain To kill their gracious father? damned fact! How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight, In pious rage, the two delinquents tear That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep? Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too; For ’twould have anger’d any heart alive, To hear the men deny’t. So that, I say, He has borne all things well: and I do think, That had he Duncan’s sons under his key (As, and’t please heaven, he shall not) they should find What ’twere to kill a father; so should Fleance. But, peace!—for from broad words, and ’cause he fail’d His presence at the tyrant’s feast, I hear, Macduff lives in disgrace. Sir, can you tell Where he bestows himself?  LORD. The son of Duncan, From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth, Lives in the English court and is receiv’d Of the most pious Edward with such grace That the malevolence of fortune nothing Takes from his high respect. Thither Macduff Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid To wake Northumberland, and warlike Siward That, by the help of these (with Him above To ratify the work), we may again Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights; Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives, Do faithful homage, and receive free honours, All which we pine for now. And this report Hath so exasperate the King that he Prepares for some attempt of war.  LENNOX. Sent he to Macduff?  LORD. He did: and with an absolute “Sir, not I,” The cloudy messenger turns me his back, And hums, as who should say, “You’ll rue the time That clogs me with this answer.”  LENNOX. And that well might Advise him to a caution, t’ hold what distance His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel Fly to the court of England, and unfold His message ere he come, that a swift blessing May soon return to this our suffering country Under a hand accurs’d!  LORD. I’ll send my prayers with him.   [_Exeunt._]
ACT V  SCENE I. Dunsinane. A Room in the Castle.   Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting-Gentlewoman.  DOCTOR. I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive no truth in your report. When was it she last walked?  GENTLEWOMAN. Since his Majesty went into the field, I have seen her rise from her bed, throw her nightgown upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it, write upon’t, read it, afterwards seal it, and again return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.  DOCTOR. A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of watching. In this slumbery agitation, besides her walking and other actual performances, what, at any time, have you heard her say?  GENTLEWOMAN. That, sir, which I will not report after her.  DOCTOR. You may to me; and ’tis most meet you should.  GENTLEWOMAN. Neither to you nor anyone; having no witness to confirm my speech.   Enter Lady Macbeth with a taper.  Lo you, here she comes! This is her very guise; and, upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close.  DOCTOR. How came she by that light?  GENTLEWOMAN. Why, it stood by her: she has light by her continually; ’tis her command.  DOCTOR. You see, her eyes are open.  GENTLEWOMAN. Ay, but their sense are shut.  DOCTOR. What is it she does now? Look how she rubs her hands.  GENTLEWOMAN. It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus washing her hands. I have known her continue in this a quarter of an hour.  LADY MACBETH. Yet here’s a spot.  DOCTOR. Hark, she speaks. I will set down what comes from her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.  LADY MACBETH. Out, damned spot! out, I say! One; two. Why, then ’tis time to do’t. Hell is murky! Fie, my lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we fear who knows it, when none can call our power to account? Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him?  DOCTOR. Do you mark that?  LADY MACBETH. The Thane of Fife had a wife. Where is she now?—What, will these hands ne’er be clean? No more o’ that, my lord, no more o’ that: you mar all with this starting.  DOCTOR. Go to, go to. You have known what you should not.  GENTLEWOMAN. She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of that: heaven knows what she has known.  LADY MACBETH. Here’s the smell of the blood still: all the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand. Oh, oh, oh!  DOCTOR. What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.  GENTLEWOMAN. I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body.  DOCTOR. Well, well, well.  GENTLEWOMAN. Pray God it be, sir.  DOCTOR. This disease is beyond my practice: yet I have known those which have walked in their sleep, who have died holily in their beds.  LADY MACBETH. Wash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not so pale. I tell you yet again, Banquo’s buried; he cannot come out on’s grave.  DOCTOR. Even so?  LADY MACBETH. To bed, to bed. There’s knocking at the gate. Come, come, come, come, give me your hand. What’s done cannot be undone. To bed, to bed, to bed.   [_Exit._]  DOCTOR. Will she go now to bed?  GENTLEWOMAN. Directly.  DOCTOR. Foul whisp’rings are abroad. Unnatural deeds Do breed unnatural troubles: infected minds To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets. More needs she the divine than the physician.— God, God, forgive us all! Look after her; Remove from her the means of all annoyance, And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night: My mind she has mated, and amaz’d my sight. I think, but dare not speak.  GENTLEWOMAN. Good night, good doctor.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. The Country near Dunsinane.   Enter, with drum and colours Menteith, Caithness, Angus, Lennox and  Soldiers.  MENTEITH. The English power is near, led on by Malcolm, His uncle Siward, and the good Macduff. Revenges burn in them; for their dear causes Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm Excite the mortified man.  ANGUS. Near Birnam wood Shall we well meet them. That way are they coming.  CAITHNESS. Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?  LENNOX. For certain, sir, he is not. I have a file Of all the gentry: there is Siward’s son And many unrough youths, that even now Protest their first of manhood.  MENTEITH. What does the tyrant?  CAITHNESS. Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies. Some say he’s mad; others, that lesser hate him, Do call it valiant fury: but, for certain, He cannot buckle his distemper’d cause Within the belt of rule.  ANGUS. Now does he feel His secret murders sticking on his hands; Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach; Those he commands move only in command, Nothing in love: now does he feel his title Hang loose about him, like a giant’s robe Upon a dwarfish thief.  MENTEITH. Who, then, shall blame His pester’d senses to recoil and start, When all that is within him does condemn Itself for being there?  CAITHNESS. Well, march we on, To give obedience where ’tis truly ow’d: Meet we the med’cine of the sickly weal; And with him pour we, in our country’s purge, Each drop of us.  LENNOX. Or so much as it needs To dew the sovereign flower, and drown the weeds. Make we our march towards Birnam.   [_Exeunt, marching._]  SCENE III. Dunsinane. A Room in the Castle.   Enter Macbeth, Doctor and Attendants.  MACBETH. Bring me no more reports; let them fly all: Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane I cannot taint with fear. What’s the boy Malcolm? Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know All mortal consequences have pronounc’d me thus: “Fear not, Macbeth; no man that’s born of woman Shall e’er have power upon thee.”—Then fly, false thanes, And mingle with the English epicures: The mind I sway by, and the heart I bear, Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.   Enter a Servant.  The devil damn thee black, thou cream-fac’d loon! Where gott’st thou that goose look?  SERVANT. There is ten thousand—  MACBETH. Geese, villain?  SERVANT. Soldiers, sir.  MACBETH. Go prick thy face and over-red thy fear, Thou lily-liver’d boy. What soldiers, patch? Death of thy soul! those linen cheeks of thine Are counsellors to fear. What soldiers, whey-face?  SERVANT. The English force, so please you.  MACBETH. Take thy face hence.   [_Exit Servant._]  Seyton!—I am sick at heart, When I behold—Seyton, I say!—This push Will cheer me ever or disseat me now. I have liv’d long enough: my way of life Is fall’n into the sere, the yellow leaf; And that which should accompany old age, As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends, I must not look to have; but, in their stead, Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honour, breath, Which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not. Seyton!—   Enter Seyton.  SEYTON. What’s your gracious pleasure?  MACBETH. What news more?  SEYTON. All is confirm’d, my lord, which was reported.  MACBETH. I’ll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack’d. Give me my armour.  SEYTON. ’Tis not needed yet.  MACBETH. I’ll put it on. Send out more horses, skirr the country round; Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine armour.— How does your patient, doctor?  DOCTOR. Not so sick, my lord, As she is troubled with thick-coming fancies, That keep her from her rest.  MACBETH. Cure her of that: Canst thou not minister to a mind diseas’d, Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow, Raze out the written troubles of the brain, And with some sweet oblivious antidote Cleanse the stuff’d bosom of that perilous stuff Which weighs upon the heart?  DOCTOR. Therein the patient Must minister to himself.  MACBETH. Throw physic to the dogs, I’ll none of it. Come, put mine armour on; give me my staff: Seyton, send out.—Doctor, the Thanes fly from me.— Come, sir, despatch.—If thou couldst, doctor, cast The water of my land, find her disease, And purge it to a sound and pristine health, I would applaud thee to the very echo, That should applaud again.—Pull’t off, I say.— What rhubarb, senna, or what purgative drug, Would scour these English hence? Hear’st thou of them?  DOCTOR. Ay, my good lord. Your royal preparation Makes us hear something.  MACBETH. Bring it after me.— I will not be afraid of death and bane, Till Birnam forest come to Dunsinane.   [_Exeunt all except Doctor._]  DOCTOR. Were I from Dunsinane away and clear, Profit again should hardly draw me here.   [_Exit._]  SCENE IV. Country near Dunsinane: a Wood in view.   Enter, with drum and colours Malcolm, old Siward and his Son, Macduff,  Menteith, Caithness, Angus, Lennox, Ross and Soldiers, marching.  MALCOLM. Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand That chambers will be safe.  MENTEITH. We doubt it nothing.  SIWARD. What wood is this before us?  MENTEITH. The wood of Birnam.  MALCOLM. Let every soldier hew him down a bough, And bear’t before him. Thereby shall we shadow The numbers of our host, and make discovery Err in report of us.  SOLDIERS. It shall be done.  SIWARD. We learn no other but the confident tyrant Keeps still in Dunsinane, and will endure Our setting down before’t.  MALCOLM. ’Tis his main hope; For where there is advantage to be given, Both more and less have given him the revolt, And none serve with him but constrained things, Whose hearts are absent too.  MACDUFF. Let our just censures Attend the true event, and put we on Industrious soldiership.  SIWARD. The time approaches, That will with due decision make us know What we shall say we have, and what we owe. Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate, But certain issue strokes must arbitrate; Towards which advance the war.   [_Exeunt, marching._]  SCENE V. Dunsinane. Within the castle.   Enter with drum and colours, Macbeth, Seyton and Soldiers.  MACBETH. Hang out our banners on the outward walls; The cry is still, “They come!” Our castle’s strength Will laugh a siege to scorn: here let them lie Till famine and the ague eat them up. Were they not forc’d with those that should be ours, We might have met them dareful, beard to beard, And beat them backward home.   [_A cry of women within._]  What is that noise?  SEYTON. It is the cry of women, my good lord.   [_Exit._]  MACBETH. I have almost forgot the taste of fears. The time has been, my senses would have cool’d To hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir As life were in’t. I have supp’d full with horrors; Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts, Cannot once start me.   Enter Seyton.  Wherefore was that cry?  SEYTON. The Queen, my lord, is dead.  MACBETH. She should have died hereafter. There would have been a time for such a word. Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, Creeps in this petty pace from day to day, To the last syllable of recorded time; And all our yesterdays have lighted fools The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle! Life’s but a walking shadow; a poor player, That struts and frets his hour upon the stage, And then is heard no more: it is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing.   Enter a Messenger.  Thou com’st to use thy tongue; thy story quickly.  MESSENGER. Gracious my lord, I should report that which I say I saw, But know not how to do’t.  MACBETH. Well, say, sir.  MESSENGER. As I did stand my watch upon the hill, I look’d toward Birnam, and anon, methought, The wood began to move.  MACBETH. Liar, and slave!  MESSENGER. Let me endure your wrath, if’t be not so. Within this three mile may you see it coming; I say, a moving grove.  MACBETH. If thou speak’st false, Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive, Till famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth, I care not if thou dost for me as much.— I pull in resolution; and begin To doubt th’ equivocation of the fiend, That lies like truth. “Fear not, till Birnam wood Do come to Dunsinane;” and now a wood Comes toward Dunsinane.—Arm, arm, and out!— If this which he avouches does appear, There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here. I ’gin to be aweary of the sun, And wish th’ estate o’ th’ world were now undone.— Ring the alarum bell!—Blow, wind! come, wrack! At least we’ll die with harness on our back.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE VI. The same. A Plain before the Castle.   Enter, with drum and colours, Malcolm, old Siward, Macduff and their  Army, with boughs.  MALCOLM. Now near enough. Your leafy screens throw down, And show like those you are.—You, worthy uncle, Shall with my cousin, your right noble son, Lead our first battle: worthy Macduff and we Shall take upon’s what else remains to do, According to our order.  SIWARD. Fare you well.— Do we but find the tyrant’s power tonight, Let us be beaten, if we cannot fight.  MACDUFF. Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath, Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE VII. The same. Another part of the Plain.   Alarums. Enter Macbeth.  MACBETH. They have tied me to a stake. I cannot fly, But, bear-like I must fight the course.—What’s he That was not born of woman? Such a one Am I to fear, or none.   Enter young Siward.  YOUNG SIWARD. What is thy name?  MACBETH. Thou’lt be afraid to hear it.  YOUNG SIWARD. No; though thou call’st thyself a hotter name Than any is in hell.  MACBETH. My name’s Macbeth.  YOUNG SIWARD. The devil himself could not pronounce a title More hateful to mine ear.  MACBETH. No, nor more fearful.  YOUNG SIWARD. Thou liest, abhorred tyrant. With my sword I’ll prove the lie thou speak’st.   [_They fight, and young Siward is slain._]  MACBETH. Thou wast born of woman. But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn, Brandish’d by man that’s of a woman born.   [_Exit._]   Alarums. Enter Macduff.  MACDUFF. That way the noise is.—Tyrant, show thy face! If thou be’st slain and with no stroke of mine, My wife and children’s ghosts will haunt me still. I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms Are hired to bear their staves. Either thou, Macbeth, Or else my sword, with an unbatter’d edge, I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be; By this great clatter, one of greatest note Seems bruited. Let me find him, Fortune! And more I beg not.   [_Exit. Alarums._]   Enter Malcolm and old Siward.  SIWARD. This way, my lord;—the castle’s gently render’d: The tyrant’s people on both sides do fight; The noble thanes do bravely in the war, The day almost itself professes yours, And little is to do.  MALCOLM. We have met with foes That strike beside us.  SIWARD. Enter, sir, the castle.   [_Exeunt. Alarums._]  SCENE VIII. The same. Another part of the field.   Enter Macbeth.  MACBETH. Why should I play the Roman fool, and die On mine own sword? whiles I see lives, the gashes Do better upon them.   Enter Macduff.  MACDUFF. Turn, hell-hound, turn!  MACBETH. Of all men else I have avoided thee: But get thee back; my soul is too much charg’d With blood of thine already.  MACDUFF. I have no words; My voice is in my sword: thou bloodier villain Than terms can give thee out!   [_They fight._]  MACBETH. Thou losest labour: As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air With thy keen sword impress, as make me bleed: Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests; I bear a charmed life, which must not yield To one of woman born.  MACDUFF. Despair thy charm; And let the angel whom thou still hast serv’d Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother’s womb Untimely ripp’d.  MACBETH. Accursed be that tongue that tells me so, For it hath cow’d my better part of man! And be these juggling fiends no more believ’d, That palter with us in a double sense; That keep the word of promise to our ear, And break it to our hope!—I’ll not fight with thee.  MACDUFF. Then yield thee, coward, And live to be the show and gaze o’ th’ time. We’ll have thee, as our rarer monsters are, Painted upon a pole, and underwrit, “Here may you see the tyrant.”  MACBETH. I will not yield, To kiss the ground before young Malcolm’s feet, And to be baited with the rabble’s curse. Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane, And thou oppos’d, being of no woman born, Yet I will try the last. Before my body I throw my warlike shield: lay on, Macduff; And damn’d be him that first cries, “Hold, enough!”   [_Exeunt fighting. Alarums._]   Retreat. Flourish. Enter, with drum and colours, Malcolm, old Siward,  Ross, Thanes and Soldiers.  MALCOLM. I would the friends we miss were safe arriv’d.  SIWARD. Some must go off; and yet, by these I see, So great a day as this is cheaply bought.  MALCOLM. Macduff is missing, and your noble son.  ROSS. Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier’s debt: He only liv’d but till he was a man; The which no sooner had his prowess confirm’d In the unshrinking station where he fought, But like a man he died.  SIWARD. Then he is dead?  ROSS. Ay, and brought off the field. Your cause of sorrow Must not be measur’d by his worth, for then It hath no end.  SIWARD. Had he his hurts before?  ROSS. Ay, on the front.  SIWARD. Why then, God’s soldier be he! Had I as many sons as I have hairs, I would not wish them to a fairer death: And so his knell is knoll’d.  MALCOLM. He’s worth more sorrow, And that I’ll spend for him.  SIWARD. He’s worth no more. They say he parted well and paid his score: And so, God be with him!—Here comes newer comfort.   Enter Macduff with Macbeth’s head.  MACDUFF. Hail, King, for so thou art. Behold, where stands Th’ usurper’s cursed head: the time is free. I see thee compass’d with thy kingdom’s pearl, That speak my salutation in their minds; Whose voices I desire aloud with mine,— Hail, King of Scotland!  ALL. Hail, King of Scotland!   [_Flourish._]  MALCOLM. We shall not spend a large expense of time Before we reckon with your several loves, And make us even with you. My thanes and kinsmen, Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland In such an honour nam’d. What’s more to do, Which would be planted newly with the time,— As calling home our exil’d friends abroad, That fled the snares of watchful tyranny; Producing forth the cruel ministers Of this dead butcher, and his fiend-like queen, Who, as ’tis thought, by self and violent hands Took off her life;—this, and what needful else That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace, We will perform in measure, time, and place. So thanks to all at once, and to each one, Whom we invite to see us crown’d at Scone.   [_Flourish. Exeunt._]

  ACT I  SCENE I. An apartment in the Duke’s palace.
Enter Duke, Escalus, Lords and Attendants.  DUKE. Escalus.  ESCALUS. My lord.  DUKE. Of government the properties to unfold Would seem in me t’ affect speech and discourse, Since I am put to know that your own science Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice My strength can give you. Then no more remains But that, to your sufficiency, as your worth is able, And let them work. The nature of our people, Our city’s institutions, and the terms For common justice, you’re as pregnant in As art and practice hath enriched any That we remember. There is our commission, From which we would not have you warp.—Call hither, I say, bid come before us, Angelo.  [_Exit an Attendant._]  What figure of us think you he will bear? For you must know we have with special soul Elected him our absence to supply; Lent him our terror, drest him with our love, And given his deputation all the organs Of our own power. What think you of it?  ESCALUS. If any in Vienna be of worth To undergo such ample grace and honour, It is Lord Angelo.  Enter Angelo.  DUKE. Look where he comes.  ANGELO. Always obedient to your Grace’s will, I come to know your pleasure.  DUKE. Angelo, There is a kind of character in thy life That to th’ observer doth thy history Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings Are not thine own so proper as to waste Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee. Heaven doth with us as we with torches do, Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues Did not go forth of us, ’twere all alike As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touched But to fine issues; nor nature never lends The smallest scruple of her excellence But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines Herself the glory of a creditor, Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech To one that can my part in him advertise. Hold, therefore, Angelo. In our remove be thou at full ourself. Mortality and mercy in Vienna Live in thy tongue and heart. Old Escalus, Though first in question, is thy secondary. Take thy commission.  ANGELO. Now, good my lord, Let there be some more test made of my metal, Before so noble and so great a figure Be stamped upon it.  DUKE. No more evasion. We have with a leavened and prepared choice Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours. Our haste from hence is of so quick condition That it prefers itself, and leaves unquestioned Matters of needful value. We shall write to you, As time and our concernings shall importune, How it goes with us; and do look to know What doth befall you here. So, fare you well. To th’ hopeful execution do I leave you Of your commissions.  ANGELO. Yet give leave, my lord, That we may bring you something on the way.  DUKE. My haste may not admit it; Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do With any scruple. Your scope is as mine own, So to enforce or qualify the laws As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand; I’ll privily away. I love the people, But do not like to stage me to their eyes. Though it do well, I do not relish well Their loud applause and _Aves_ vehement; Nor do I think the man of safe discretion That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.  ANGELO. The heavens give safety to your purposes!  ESCALUS. Lead forth and bring you back in happiness.  DUKE. I thank you. Fare you well.  [_Exit._]  ESCALUS. I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave To have free speech with you; and it concerns me To look into the bottom of my place. A power I have, but of what strength and nature I am not yet instructed.  ANGELO. ’Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together, And we may soon our satisfaction have Touching that point.  ESCALUS. I’ll wait upon your honour.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. A street.  Enter Lucio and two other Gentlemen.  LUCIO. If the Duke, with the other dukes, come not to composition with the King of Hungary, why then all the dukes fall upon the King.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Heaven grant us its peace, but not the King of Hungary’s!  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Amen.  LUCIO. Thou conclud’st like the sanctimonious pirate that went to sea with the ten commandments, but scraped one out of the table.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. “Thou shalt not steal”?  LUCIO. Ay, that he razed.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Why, ’twas a commandment to command the captain and all the rest from their functions! They put forth to steal. There’s not a soldier of us all that, in the thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petition well that prays for peace.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. I never heard any soldier dislike it.  LUCIO. I believe thee; for I think thou never wast where grace was said.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. No? A dozen times at least.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. What? In metre?  LUCIO. In any proportion or in any language.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. I think, or in any religion.  LUCIO. Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all controversy; as, for example, thou thyself art a wicked villain, despite of all grace.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Well, there went but a pair of shears between us.  LUCIO. I grant, as there may between the lists and the velvet. Thou art the list.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. And thou the velvet. Thou art good velvet; thou’rt a three-piled piece, I warrant thee. I had as lief be a list of an English kersey as be piled, as thou art piled, for a French velvet. Do I speak feelingly now?  LUCIO. I think thou dost, and indeed, with most painful feeling of thy speech. I will, out of thine own confession, learn to begin thy health; but, whilst I live, forget to drink after thee.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. I think I have done myself wrong, have I not?  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Yes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or free.  Enter Mistress Overdone, a Bawd.  LUCIO. Behold, behold, where Madam Mitigation comes! I have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to—  SECOND GENTLEMAN. To what, I pray?  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Judge.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. To three thousand dolours a year.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Ay, and more.  LUCIO. A French crown more.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Thou art always figuring diseases in me, but thou art full of error; I am sound.  LUCIO. Nay, not, as one would say, healthy, but so sound as things that are hollow. Thy bones are hollow. Impiety has made a feast of thee.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. How now, which of your hips has the most profound sciatica?  BAWD. Well, well! There’s one yonder arrested and carried to prison was worth five thousand of you all.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Who’s that, I pray thee?  BAWD. Marry, sir, that’s Claudio, Signior Claudio.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Claudio to prison? ’Tis not so.  BAWD. Nay, but I know ’tis so. I saw him arrested, saw him carried away; and, which is more, within these three days his head to be chopped off.  LUCIO. But, after all this fooling, I would not have it so. Art thou sure of this?  BAWD. I am too sure of it. And it is for getting Madam Julietta with child.  LUCIO. Believe me, this may be. He promised to meet me two hours since, and he was ever precise in promise-keeping.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Besides, you know, it draws something near to the speech we had to such a purpose.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. But most of all agreeing with the proclamation.  LUCIO. Away! Let’s go learn the truth of it.  [_Exeunt Lucio and Gentlemen._]  BAWD. Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what with the gallows, and what with poverty, I am custom-shrunk.  Enter Pompey.  How now? What’s the news with you?  POMPEY. Yonder man is carried to prison.  BAWD. Well, what has he done?  POMPEY. A woman.  BAWD. But what’s his offence?  POMPEY. Groping for trouts in a peculiar river.  BAWD. What? Is there a maid with child by him?  POMPEY. No, but there’s a woman with maid by him. You have not heard of the proclamation, have you?  BAWD. What proclamation, man?  POMPEY. All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked down.  BAWD. And what shall become of those in the city?  POMPEY. They shall stand for seed. They had gone down too, but that a wise burgher put in for them.  BAWD. But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be pulled down?  POMPEY. To the ground, mistress.  BAWD. Why, here’s a change indeed in the commonwealth! What shall become of me?  POMPEY. Come, fear not you. Good counsellors lack no clients. Though you change your place, you need not change your trade. I’ll be your tapster still. Courage, there will be pity taken on you. You that have worn your eyes almost out in the service, you will be considered.  Enter Provost, Claudio, Juliet and Officers.  BAWD. What’s to do here, Thomas Tapster? Let’s withdraw.  POMPEY. Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the Provost to prison. And there’s Madam Juliet.  [_Exeunt Bawd and Pompey._]  CLAUDIO. Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to the world? Bear me to prison, where I am committed.  PROVOST. I do it not in evil disposition, But from Lord Angelo by special charge.  CLAUDIO. Thus can the demi-god Authority Make us pay down for our offence by weight. The words of heaven; on whom it will, it will; On whom it will not, so; yet still ’tis just.  Enter Lucio and two Gentlemen.  LUCIO. Why, how now, Claudio? Whence comes this restraint?  CLAUDIO. From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty. As surfeit is the father of much fast, So every scope by the immoderate use Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue, Like rats that ravin down their proper bane, A thirsty evil; and when we drink, we die.  LUCIO. If I could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would send for certain of my creditors; and yet, to say the truth, I had as lief have the foppery of freedom as the morality of imprisonment. What’s thy offence, Claudio?  CLAUDIO. What but to speak of would offend again.  LUCIO. What, is’t murder?  CLAUDIO. No.  LUCIO. Lechery?  CLAUDIO. Call it so.  PROVOST. Away, sir; you must go.  CLAUDIO. One word, good friend.—Lucio, a word with you.  LUCIO. A hundred, if they’ll do you any good. Is lechery so looked after?  CLAUDIO. Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract I got possession of Julietta’s bed. You know the lady; she is fast my wife, Save that we do the denunciation lack Of outward order. This we came not to Only for propagation of a dower Remaining in the coffer of her friends, From whom we thought it meet to hide our love Till time had made them for us. But it chances The stealth of our most mutual entertainment With character too gross is writ on Juliet.  LUCIO. With child, perhaps?  CLAUDIO. Unhappily, even so. And the new deputy now for the Duke— Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness, Or whether that the body public be A horse whereon the governor doth ride, Who, newly in the seat, that it may know He can command, lets it straight feel the spur; Whether the tyranny be in his place, Or in his eminence that fills it up, I stagger in—but this new governor Awakes me all the enrolled penalties Which have, like unscoured armour, hung by th’ wall So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round, And none of them been worn; and for a name Now puts the drowsy and neglected act Freshly on me. ’Tis surely for a name.  LUCIO. I warrant it is. And thy head stands so tickle on thy shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love, may sigh it off. Send after the Duke, and appeal to him.  CLAUDIO. I have done so, but he’s not to be found. I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service: This day my sister should the cloister enter, And there receive her approbation. Acquaint her with the danger of my state; Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him. I have great hope in that. For in her youth There is a prone and speechless dialect Such as moves men; beside, she hath prosperous art When she will play with reason and discourse, And well she can persuade.  LUCIO. I pray she may, as well for the encouragement of the like, which else would stand under grievous imposition, as for the enjoying of thy life, who I would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a game of tick-tack. I’ll to her.  CLAUDIO. I thank you, good friend Lucio.  LUCIO. Within two hours.  CLAUDIO. Come, officer, away.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. A monastery.  Enter Duke and Friar Thomas.  DUKE. No, holy father, throw away that thought; Believe not that the dribbling dart of love Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee To give me secret harbour hath a purpose More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends Of burning youth.  FRIAR THOMAS. May your Grace speak of it?  DUKE. My holy sir, none better knows than you How I have ever loved the life removed, And held in idle price to haunt assemblies Where youth, and cost, a witless bravery keeps. I have delivered to Lord Angelo, A man of stricture and firm abstinence, My absolute power and place here in Vienna, And he supposes me travelled to Poland; For so I have strewed it in the common ear, And so it is received. Now, pious sir, You will demand of me why I do this?  FRIAR THOMAS. Gladly, my lord.  DUKE. We have strict statutes and most biting laws, The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds, Which for this fourteen years we have let slip, Even like an o’ergrown lion in a cave That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers, Having bound up the threat’ning twigs of birch, Only to stick it in their children’s sight For terror, not to use, in time the rod Becomes more mocked than feared: so our decrees, Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead, And liberty plucks justice by the nose, The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart Goes all decorum.  FRIAR THOMAS. It rested in your Grace To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased; And it in you more dreadful would have seemed Than in Lord Angelo.  DUKE. I do fear, too dreadful. Sith ’twas my fault to give the people scope, ’Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them For what I bid them do; for we bid this be done When evil deeds have their permissive pass And not the punishment. Therefore, indeed, my father, I have on Angelo imposed the office; Who may in th’ ambush of my name strike home, And yet my nature never in the fight To do in slander. And to behold his sway, I will, as ’twere a brother of your order, Visit both prince and people. Therefore, I prithee, Supply me with the habit, and instruct me How I may formally in person bear Like a true friar. Moe reasons for this action At our more leisure shall I render you; Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise; Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses That his blood flows or that his appetite Is more to bread than stone. Hence shall we see, If power change purpose, what our seemers be.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IV. A nunnery.  Enter Isabella and Francisca, a Nun.  ISABELLA. And have you nuns no farther privileges?  FRANCISCA. Are not these large enough?  ISABELLA. Yes, truly; I speak not as desiring more, But rather wishing a more strict restraint Upon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare.  LUCIO. [_Within_.] Ho! Peace be in this place!  ISABELLA. Who’s that which calls?  FRANCISCA. It is a man’s voice. Gentle Isabella, Turn you the key, and know his business of him; You may, I may not; you are yet unsworn. When you have vowed, you must not speak with men But in the presence of the prioress; Then, if you speak, you must not show your face; Or if you show your face, you must not speak. He calls again. I pray you answer him.  [_Exit Francisca._]  ISABELLA. Peace and prosperity! Who is’t that calls?  Enter Lucio.  LUCIO. Hail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-roses Proclaim you are no less. Can you so stead me As bring me to the sight of Isabella, A novice of this place, and the fair sister To her unhappy brother Claudio?  ISABELLA. Why “her unhappy brother”? let me ask, The rather for I now must make you know I am that Isabella, and his sister.  LUCIO. Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you. Not to be weary with you, he’s in prison.  ISABELLA. Woe me! For what?  LUCIO. For that which, if myself might be his judge, He should receive his punishment in thanks: He hath got his friend with child.  ISABELLA. Sir, make me not your story.  LUCIO. ’Tis true. I would not, though ’tis my familiar sin With maids to seem the lapwing, and to jest, Tongue far from heart, play with all virgins so. I hold you as a thing enskied and sainted By your renouncement an immortal spirit, And to be talked with in sincerity, As with a saint.  ISABELLA. You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.  LUCIO. Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, ’tis thus: Your brother and his lover have embraced; As those that feed grow full, as blossoming time That from the seedness the bare fallow brings To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry.  ISABELLA. Someone with child by him? My cousin Juliet?  LUCIO. Is she your cousin?  ISABELLA. Adoptedly, as school-maids change their names By vain though apt affection.  LUCIO. She it is.  ISABELLA. O, let him marry her!  LUCIO. This is the point. The Duke is very strangely gone from hence; Bore many gentlemen, myself being one, In hand, and hope of action; but we do learn, By those that know the very nerves of state, His givings-out were of an infinite distance From his true-meant design. Upon his place, And with full line of his authority, Governs Lord Angelo; a man whose blood Is very snow-broth; one who never feels The wanton stings and motions of the sense; But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge With profits of the mind, study and fast. He, to give fear to use and liberty, Which have for long run by the hideous law As mice by lions, hath picked out an act, Under whose heavy sense your brother’s life Falls into forfeit. He arrests him on it, And follows close the rigour of the statute To make him an example. All hope is gone, Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer To soften Angelo. And that’s my pith of business ’Twixt you and your poor brother.  ISABELLA. Doth he so Seek his life?  LUCIO. Has censured him already; And, as I hear, the Provost hath a warrant For’s execution.  ISABELLA. Alas, what poor ability’s in me To do him good?  LUCIO. Assay the power you have.  ISABELLA. My power? Alas, I doubt.  LUCIO. Our doubts are traitors, And make us lose the good we oft might win By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo, And let him learn to know, when maidens sue, Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel, All their petitions are as freely theirs As they themselves would owe them.  ISABELLA. I’ll see what I can do.  LUCIO. But speedily.  ISABELLA. I will about it straight; No longer staying but to give the Mother Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you. Commend me to my brother. Soon at night I’ll send him certain word of my success.  LUCIO. I take my leave of you.  ISABELLA. Good sir, adieu.  [_Exeunt._]
  ACT II  SCENE I. A hall in Angelo’s house.
Enter Angelo, Escalus, Servants, and a Justice.  ANGELO. We must not make a scarecrow of the law, Setting it up to fear the birds of prey, And let it keep one shape till custom make it Their perch, and not their terror.  ESCALUS. Ay, but yet Let us be keen, and rather cut a little Than fall and bruise to death. Alas, this gentleman, Whom I would save, had a most noble father. Let but your honour know, Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue, That, in the working of your own affections, Had time cohered with place, or place with wishing, Or that the resolute acting of your blood Could have attained th’ effect of your own purpose, Whether you had not sometime in your life Erred in this point which now you censure him, And pulled the law upon you.  ANGELO. ’Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus, Another thing to fall. I not deny The jury passing on the prisoner’s life May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two Guiltier than him they try. What’s open made to justice, That justice seizes. What knows the laws That thieves do pass on thieves? ’Tis very pregnant, The jewel that we find, we stoop and take ’t, Because we see it; but what we do not see, We tread upon, and never think of it. You may not so extenuate his offence For I have had such faults; but rather tell me, When I that censure him do so offend, Let mine own judgement pattern out my death, And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die.  Enter Provost.  ESCALUS. Be it as your wisdom will.  ANGELO. Where is the Provost?  PROVOST. Here, if it like your honour.  ANGELO. See that Claudio Be executed by nine tomorrow morning. Bring him his confessor, let him be prepared, For that’s the utmost of his pilgrimage.  [_Exit Provost._]  ESCALUS. Well, heaven forgive him; and forgive us all. Some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall. Some run from brakes of vice, and answer none, And some condemned for a fault alone.  Enter Elbow and Officers with Froth and Pompey.  ELBOW. Come, bring them away. If these be good people in a commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses in common houses, I know no law. Bring them away.  ANGELO. How now, sir, what’s your name? And what’s the matter?  ELBOW. If it please your honour, I am the poor Duke’s constable, and my name is Elbow. I do lean upon justice, sir, and do bring in here before your good honour two notorious benefactors.  ANGELO. Benefactors? Well, what benefactors are they? Are they not malefactors?  ELBOW. If it please your honour, I know not well what they are, but precise villains they are, that I am sure of, and void of all profanation in the world that good Christians ought to have.  ESCALUS. This comes off well. Here’s a wise officer.  ANGELO. Go to. What quality are they of? Elbow is your name? Why dost thou not speak, Elbow?  POMPEY. He cannot, sir. He’s out at elbow.  ANGELO. What are you, sir?  ELBOW. He, sir? A tapster, sir; parcel bawd; one that serves a bad woman; whose house, sir, was, as they say, plucked down in the suburbs; and now she professes a hot-house, which, I think is a very ill house too.  ESCALUS. How know you that?  ELBOW. My wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your honour—  ESCALUS. How? Thy wife?  ELBOW. Ay, sir, whom I thank heaven is an honest woman—  ESCALUS. Dost thou detest her therefore?  ELBOW. I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as she, that this house, if it be not a bawd’s house, it is pity of her life, for it is a naughty house.  ESCALUS. How dost thou know that, constable?  ELBOW. Marry, sir, by my wife, who, if she had been a woman cardinally given, might have been accused in fornication, adultery, and all uncleanliness there.  ESCALUS. By the woman’s means?  ELBOW. Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone’s means; but as she spit in his face, so she defied him.  POMPEY. Sir, if it please your honour, this is not so.  ELBOW. Prove it before these varlets here, thou honourable man, prove it.  ESCALUS. [_To Angelo_.] Do you hear how he misplaces?  POMPEY. Sir, she came in great with child; and longing, saving your honour’s reverence, for stewed prunes; sir, we had but two in the house, which at that very distant time stood, as it were, in a fruit dish, a dish of some threepence; your honours have seen such dishes; they are not china dishes, but very good dishes—  ESCALUS. Go to, go to. No matter for the dish, sir.  POMPEY. No, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein in the right. But to the point. As I say, this Mistress Elbow, being, as I say, with child, and being great-bellied, and longing, as I said, for prunes; and having but two in the dish, as I said, Master Froth here, this very man, having eaten the rest, as I said, and, as I say, paying for them very honestly; for, as you know, Master Froth, I could not give you threepence again—  FROTH. No, indeed.  POMPEY. Very well. You being then, if you be remembered, cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes—  FROTH. Ay, so I did indeed.  POMPEY. Why, very well. I telling you then, if you be remembered, that such a one and such a one were past cure of the thing you wot of, unless they kept very good diet, as I told you—  FROTH. All this is true.  POMPEY. Why, very well then—  ESCALUS. Come, you are a tedious fool. To the purpose. What was done to Elbow’s wife that he hath cause to complain of? Come me to what was done to her.  POMPEY. Sir, your honour cannot come to that yet.  ESCALUS. No, sir, nor I mean it not.  POMPEY. Sir, but you shall come to it, by your honour’s leave. And I beseech you, look into Master Froth here, sir, a man of fourscore pound a year; whose father died at Hallowmas—was’t not at Hallowmas, Master Froth?  FROTH. All-hallond Eve.  POMPEY. Why, very well. I hope here be truths. He, sir, sitting, as I say, in a lower chair, sir—’twas in the Bunch of Grapes, where, indeed, you have a delight to sit, have you not?  FROTH. I have so, because it is an open room, and good for winter.  POMPEY. Why, very well then. I hope here be truths.  ANGELO. This will last out a night in Russia When nights are longest there. I’ll take my leave, And leave you to the hearing of the cause; Hoping you’ll find good cause to whip them all.  ESCALUS. I think no less. Good morrow to your lordship.  [_Exit Angelo._]  Now, sir, come on. What was done to Elbow’s wife, once more?  POMPEY. Once, sir? There was nothing done to her once.  ELBOW. I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.  POMPEY. I beseech your honour, ask me.  ESCALUS. Well, sir, what did this gentleman to her?  POMPEY. I beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman’s face. Good Master Froth, look upon his honour; ’tis for a good purpose.—Doth your honour mark his face?  ESCALUS. Ay, sir, very well.  POMPEY. Nay, I beseech you, mark it well.  ESCALUS. Well, I do so.  POMPEY. Doth your honour see any harm in his face?  ESCALUS. Why, no.  POMPEY. I’ll be supposed upon a book, his face is the worst thing about him. Good, then, if his face be the worst thing about him, how could Master Froth do the constable’s wife any harm? I would know that of your honour.  ESCALUS. He’s in the right. Constable. What say you to it?  ELBOW. First, an it like you, the house is a respected house; next, this is a respected fellow; and his mistress is a respected woman.  POMPEY. By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected person than any of us all.  ELBOW. Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicked varlet! The time is yet to come that she was ever respected with man, woman, or child.  POMPEY. Sir, she was respected with him before he married with her.  ESCALUS. Which is the wiser here, Justice or Iniquity? Is this true?  ELBOW. O thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wicked Hannibal! I respected with her before I was married to her? If ever I was respected with her, or she with me, let not your worship think me the poor Duke’s officer. Prove this, thou wicked Hannibal, or I’ll have mine action of battery on thee.  ESCALUS. If he took you a box o’ th’ ear, you might have your action of slander too.  ELBOW. Marry, I thank your good worship for it. What is’t your worship’s pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff?  ESCALUS. Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in him that thou wouldst discover if thou couldst, let him continue in his courses till thou know’st what they are.  ELBOW. Marry, I thank your worship for it.—Thou seest, thou wicked varlet, now, what’s come upon thee. Thou art to continue now, thou varlet, thou art to continue.  ESCALUS. [_To Froth_.] Where were you born, friend?  FROTH. Here in Vienna, sir.  ESCALUS. Are you of fourscore pounds a year?  FROTH. Yes, an’t please you, sir.  ESCALUS. So. [_To Pompey_.] What trade are you of, sir?  POMPEY. A tapster, a poor widow’s tapster.  ESCALUS. Your mistress’ name?  POMPEY. Mistress Overdone.  ESCALUS. Hath she had any more than one husband?  POMPEY. Nine, sir; Overdone by the last.  ESCALUS. Nine?—Come hither to me, Master Froth. Master Froth, I would not have you acquainted with tapsters; they will draw you, Master Froth, and you will hang them. Get you gone, and let me hear no more of you.  FROTH. I thank your worship. For mine own part, I never come into any room in a taphouse but I am drawn in.  ESCALUS. Well, no more of it, Master Froth. Farewell.  [_Exit Froth._]  Come you hither to me, Master tapster. What’s your name, Master tapster?  POMPEY. Pompey.  ESCALUS. What else?  POMPEY. Bum, sir.  ESCALUS. Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you; so that, in the beastliest sense, you are Pompey the great. Pompey, you are partly a bawd, Pompey, howsoever you colour it in being a tapster, are you not? Come, tell me true, it shall be the better for you.  POMPEY. Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.  ESCALUS. How would you live, Pompey? By being a bawd? What do you think of the trade, Pompey? Is it a lawful trade?  POMPEY. If the law would allow it, sir.  ESCALUS. But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall not be allowed in Vienna.  POMPEY. Does your worship mean to geld and splay all the youth of the city?  ESCALUS. No, Pompey.  POMPEY. Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to’t then. If your worship will take order for the drabs and the knaves, you need not to fear the bawds.  ESCALUS. There is pretty orders beginning, I can tell you. It is but heading and hanging.  POMPEY. If you head and hang all that offend that way but for ten year together, you’ll be glad to give out a commission for more heads. If this law hold in Vienna ten year, I’ll rent the fairest house in it after threepence a bay. If you live to see this come to pass, say Pompey told you so.  ESCALUS. Thank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of your prophecy, hark you: I advise you, let me not find you before me again upon any complaint whatsoever; no, not for dwelling where you do. If I do, Pompey, I shall beat you to your tent, and prove a shrewd Caesar to you. In plain dealing, Pompey, I shall have you whipped. So for this time, Pompey, fare you well.  POMPEY. I thank your worship for your good counsel. [_Aside_.] But I shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shall better determine. Whip me? No, no; let carman whip his jade; The valiant heart’s not whipped out of his trade.  [_Exit._]  ESCALUS. Come hither to me, Master Elbow. Come hither, Master Constable. How long have you been in this place of constable?  ELBOW. Seven year and a half, sir.  ESCALUS. I thought, by the readiness in the office, you had continued in it sometime. You say seven years together?  ELBOW. And a half, sir.  ESCALUS. Alas, it hath been great pains to you. They do you wrong to put you so oft upon’t. Are there not men in your ward sufficient to serve it?  ELBOW. Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters. As they are chosen, they are glad to choose me for them; I do it for some piece of money, and go through with all.  ESCALUS. Look you bring me in the names of some six or seven, the most sufficient of your parish.  ELBOW. To your worship’s house, sir?  ESCALUS. To my house. Fare you well.  [_Exit Elbow._]  What’s o’clock, think you?  JUSTICE. Eleven, sir.  ESCALUS. I pray you home to dinner with me.  JUSTICE. I humbly thank you.  ESCALUS. It grieves me for the death of Claudio, But there’s no remedy.  JUSTICE. Lord Angelo is severe.  ESCALUS. It is but needful. Mercy is not itself that oft looks so; Pardon is still the nurse of second woe. But yet, Poor Claudio! There’s no remedy. Come, sir.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. Another room in the same.  Enter Provost and a Servant.  SERVANT. He’s hearing of a cause. He will come straight. I’ll tell him of you.  PROVOST. Pray you do.  [_Exit Servant._]  I’ll know His pleasure, may be he will relent. Alas, He hath but as offended in a dream; All sects, all ages, smack of this vice, and he To die for ’t!  Enter Angelo.  ANGELO. Now, what’s the matter, Provost?  PROVOST. Is it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow?  ANGELO. Did not I tell thee yea? Hadst thou not order? Why dost thou ask again?  PROVOST. Lest I might be too rash. Under your good correction, I have seen When, after execution, judgement hath Repented o’er his doom.  ANGELO. Go to; let that be mine. Do you your office, or give up your place, And you shall well be spared.  PROVOST. I crave your honour’s pardon. What shall be done, sir, with the groaning Juliet? She’s very near her hour.  ANGELO. Dispose of her To some more fitter place; and that with speed.  Enter Servant.  SERVANT. Here is the sister of the man condemned Desires access to you.  ANGELO. Hath he a sister?  PROVOST. Ay, my good lord, a very virtuous maid, And to be shortly of a sisterhood, If not already.  ANGELO. Well, let her be admitted.  [_Exit Servant._]  See you the fornicatress be removed; Let her have needful but not lavish means; There shall be order for it.  Enter Lucio and Isabella.  PROVOST. [_Offering to retire_.] Save your honour!  ANGELO. Stay a little while. [_To Isabella_.] You are welcome. What’s your will?  ISABELLA. I am a woeful suitor to your honour, Please but your honour hear me.  ANGELO. Well, what’s your suit?  ISABELLA. There is a vice that most I do abhor, And most desire should meet the blow of justice; For which I would not plead, but that I must; For which I must not plead, but that I am At war ’twixt will and will not.  ANGELO. Well, the matter?  ISABELLA. I have a brother is condemned to die; I do beseech you, let it be his fault, And not my brother.  PROVOST. Heaven give thee moving graces.  ANGELO. Condemn the fault, and not the actor of it? Why, every fault’s condemned ere it be done. Mine were the very cipher of a function To find the faults whose fine stands in record, And let go by the actor.  ISABELLA. O just but severe law! I had a brother, then. Heaven keep your honour!  [_Going._]  LUCIO. [_To Isabella_.] Give’t not o’er so. To him again, entreat him, Kneel down before him, hang upon his gown; You are too cold. If you should need a pin, You could not with more tame a tongue desire it. To him, I say.  ISABELLA. Must he needs die?  ANGELO. Maiden, no remedy.  ISABELLA. Yes, I do think that you might pardon him, And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.  ANGELO. I will not do’t.  ISABELLA. But can you if you would?  ANGELO. Look, what I will not, that I cannot do.  ISABELLA. But might you do’t, and do the world no wrong, If so your heart were touched with that remorse As mine is to him?  ANGELO. He’s sentenced, ’tis too late.  LUCIO. [_To Isabella_.] You are too cold.  ISABELLA. Too late? Why, no. I that do speak a word May call it back again. Well, believe this: No ceremony that to great ones longs, Not the king’s crown, nor the deputed sword, The marshal’s truncheon, nor the judge’s robe, Become them with one half so good a grace As mercy does. If he had been as you, and you as he, You would have slipped like him, but he like you Would not have been so stern.  ANGELO. Pray you be gone.  ISABELLA. I would to heaven I had your potency, And you were Isabel! Should it then be thus? No; I would tell what ’twere to be a judge And what a prisoner.  LUCIO. [_Aside_.] Ay, touch him; there’s the vein.  ANGELO. Your brother is a forfeit of the law, And you but waste your words.  ISABELLA. Alas, alas! Why, all the souls that were were forfeit once, And He that might the vantage best have took Found out the remedy. How would you be If He, which is the top of judgement, should But judge you as you are? O, think on that, And mercy then will breathe within your lips, Like man new made.  ANGELO. Be you content, fair maid. It is the law, not I, condemns your brother. Were he my kinsman, brother, or my son, It should be thus with him. He must die tomorrow.  ISABELLA. Tomorrow? O, that’s sudden! Spare him, spare him! He’s not prepared for death. Even for our kitchens We kill the fowl of season. Shall we serve heaven With less respect than we do minister To our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you. Who is it that hath died for this offence? There’s many have committed it.  LUCIO. Ay, well said.  ANGELO. The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept. Those many had not dared to do that evil If the first that did th’ edict infringe Had answered for his deed. Now ’tis awake, Takes note of what is done, and, like a prophet, Looks in a glass that shows what future evils, Either now, or by remissness new conceived, And so in progress to be hatched and born, Are now to have no successive degrees, But, where they live, to end.  ISABELLA. Yet show some pity.  ANGELO. I show it most of all when I show justice; For then I pity those I do not know, Which a dismissed offence would after gall, And do him right that, answering one foul wrong, Lives not to act another. Be satisfied; Your brother dies tomorrow; be content.  ISABELLA. So you must be the first that gives this sentence, And he that suffers. O, it is excellent To have a giant’s strength; but it is tyrannous To use it like a giant.  LUCIO. That’s well said.  ISABELLA. Could great men thunder As Jove himself does, Jove would ne’er be quiet, For every pelting petty officer Would use his heaven for thunder. Nothing but thunder. Merciful Heaven, Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt Splits the unwedgeable and gnarled oak, Than the soft myrtle. But man, proud man, Dressed in a little brief authority, Most ignorant of what he’s most assured, His glassy essence, like an angry ape Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven As makes the angels weep; who, with our spleens, Would all themselves laugh mortal.  LUCIO. O, to him, to him, wench! He will relent; He’s coming. I perceive ’t.  PROVOST. Pray heaven she win him.  ISABELLA. We cannot weigh our brother with ourself. Great men may jest with saints; ’tis wit in them, But in the less, foul profanation.  LUCIO. Thou’rt i’ th’ right, girl; more o’ that.  ISABELLA. That in the captain’s but a choleric word Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy.  LUCIO. Art advised o’ that? More on’t.  ANGELO. Why do you put these sayings upon me?  ISABELLA. Because authority, though it err like others, Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself That skins the vice o’ th’ top. Go to your bosom, Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know That’s like my brother’s fault. If it confess A natural guiltiness such as is his, Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue Against my brother’s life.  ANGELO. She speaks, and ’tis such sense That my sense breeds with it. [_Going_.] Fare you well.  ISABELLA. Gentle my lord, turn back.  ANGELO. I will bethink me. Come again tomorrow.  ISABELLA. Hark how I’ll bribe you. Good my lord, turn back.  ANGELO. How? Bribe me?  ISABELLA. Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.  LUCIO. You had marred all else.  ISABELLA. Not with fond shekels of the tested gold, Or stones, whose rates are either rich or poor As fancy values them, but with true prayers, That shall be up at heaven and enter there Ere sunrise, prayers from preserved souls, From fasting maids, whose minds are dedicate To nothing temporal.  ANGELO. Well; come to me tomorrow.  LUCIO. [_Aside to Isabella_.] Go to, ’tis well; away.  ISABELLA. Heaven keep your honour safe.  ANGELO. [_Aside_.] Amen. For I am that way going to temptation, Where prayers cross.  ISABELLA. At what hour tomorrow Shall I attend your lordship?  ANGELO. At any time ’fore noon.  ISABELLA. Save your honour.  [_Exeunt Isabella, Lucio and Provost._]  ANGELO. From thee, even from thy virtue! What’s this? What’s this? Is this her fault or mine? The tempter or the tempted, who sins most, ha? Not she; nor doth she tempt; but it is I That, lying by the violet in the sun, Do as the carrion does, not as the flower, Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it be That modesty may more betray our sense Than woman’s lightness? Having waste ground enough, Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary And pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie! What dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo? Dost thou desire her foully for those things That make her good? O, let her brother live. Thieves for their robbery have authority When judges steal themselves. What, do I love her, That I desire to hear her speak again And feast upon her eyes? What is’t I dream on? O cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint, With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous Is that temptation that doth goad us on To sin in loving virtue. Never could the strumpet With all her double vigour, art, and nature, Once stir my temper, but this virtuous maid Subdues me quite. Ever till now When men were fond, I smiled and wondered how.  [_Exit._]  SCENE III. A room in a prison.  Enter Duke disguised as a Friar, and Provost.  DUKE. Hail to you, Provost, so I think you are.  PROVOST. I am the Provost. What’s your will, good friar?  DUKE. Bound by my charity and my blessed order, I come to visit the afflicted spirits Here in the prison. Do me the common right To let me see them, and to make me know The nature of their crimes, that I may minister To them accordingly.  PROVOST. I would do more than that, if more were needful.  Enter Juliet.  Look, here comes one, a gentlewoman of mine, Who, falling in the flaws of her own youth, Hath blistered her report. She is with child, And he that got it, sentenced: a young man More fit to do another such offence Than die for this.  DUKE. When must he die?  PROVOST. As I do think, tomorrow. [_To Juliet_.] I have provided for you; stay a while And you shall be conducted.  DUKE. Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?  JULIET. I do; and bear the shame most patiently.  DUKE. I’ll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience, And try your penitence, if it be sound Or hollowly put on.  JULIET. I’ll gladly learn.  DUKE. Love you the man that wronged you?  JULIET. Yes, as I love the woman that wronged him.  DUKE. So then it seems your most offenceful act Was mutually committed?  JULIET. Mutually.  DUKE. Then was your sin of heavier kind than his.  JULIET. I do confess it, and repent it, father.  DUKE. ’Tis meet so, daughter; but lest you do repent As that the sin hath brought you to this shame, Which sorrow is always toward ourselves, not heaven, Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it, But as we stand in fear—  JULIET. I do repent me as it is an evil, And take the shame with joy.  DUKE. There rest. Your partner, as I hear, must die tomorrow, And I am going with instruction to him. Grace go with you! _Benedicite!_  [_Exit._]  JULIET. Must die tomorrow? O, injurious love That respites me a life, whose very comfort Is still a dying horror!  PROVOST. ’Tis pity of him.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IV. A room in Angelo’s house.  Enter Angelo.  ANGELO. When I would pray and think, I think and pray To several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words, Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue, Anchors on Isabel. Heaven in my mouth, As if I did but only chew his name, And in my heart the strong and swelling evil Of my conception. The state whereon I studied Is, like a good thing being often read, Grown sere and tedious; yea, my gravity, Wherein—let no man hear me—I take pride, Could I with boot change for an idle plume Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form, How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit, Wrench awe from fools, and tie the wiser souls To thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood. Let’s write good angel on the devil’s horn. ’Tis not the devil’s crest.  [_Knock within._]  How now, who’s there?  Enter Servant.  SERVANT. One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.  ANGELO. Teach her the way.  [_Exit Servant._]  O heavens, Why does my blood thus muster to my heart, Making both it unable for itself And dispossessing all my other parts Of necessary fitness? So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons, Come all to help him, and so stop the air By which he should revive. And even so The general subject to a well-wished king Quit their own part, and in obsequious fondness Crowd to his presence, where their untaught love Must needs appear offence.  Enter Isabella.  How now, fair maid?  ISABELLA. I am come to know your pleasure.  ANGELO. That you might know it, would much better please me Than to demand what ’tis. Your brother cannot live.  ISABELLA. Even so. Heaven keep your honour.  ANGELO. Yet may he live a while. And, it may be, As long as you or I. Yet he must die.  ISABELLA. Under your sentence?  ANGELO. Yea.  ISABELLA. When, I beseech you? That in his reprieve, Longer or shorter, he may be so fitted That his soul sicken not.  ANGELO. Ha! Fie, these filthy vices! It were as good To pardon him that hath from nature stolen A man already made, as to remit Their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven’s image In stamps that are forbid. ’Tis all as easy Falsely to take away a life true made As to put metal in restrained means To make a false one.  ISABELLA. ’Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.  ANGELO. Say you so? Then I shall pose you quickly. Which had you rather, that the most just law Now took your brother’s life; or, to redeem him, Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness As she that he hath stained?  ISABELLA. Sir, believe this: I had rather give my body than my soul.  ANGELO. I talk not of your soul. Our compelled sins Stand more for number than for accompt.  ISABELLA. How say you?  ANGELO. Nay, I’ll not warrant that, for I can speak Against the thing I say. Answer to this: I, now the voice of the recorded law, Pronounce a sentence on your brother’s life. Might there not be a charity in sin To save this brother’s life?  ISABELLA. Please you to do’t, I’ll take it as a peril to my soul; It is no sin at all, but charity.  ANGELO. Pleased you to do’t at peril of your soul, Were equal poise of sin and charity.  ISABELLA. That I do beg his life, if it be sin, Heaven let me bear it. You granting of my suit, If that be sin, I’ll make it my morn prayer To have it added to the faults of mine, And nothing of your answer.  ANGELO. Nay, but hear me. Your sense pursues not mine. Either you are ignorant, Or seem so, crafty; and that’s not good.  ISABELLA. Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good, But graciously to know I am no better.  ANGELO. Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright When it doth tax itself, as these black masks Proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder Than beauty could, displayed. But mark me; To be received plain, I’ll speak more gross. Your brother is to die.  ISABELLA. So.  ANGELO. And his offence is so, as it appears, Accountant to the law upon that pain.  ISABELLA. True.  ANGELO. Admit no other way to save his life— As I subscribe not that, nor any other, But, in the loss of question, that you, his sister, Finding yourself desired of such a person Whose credit with the judge, or own great place, Could fetch your brother from the manacles Of the all-binding law; and that there were No earthly mean to save him but that either You must lay down the treasures of your body To this supposed, or else to let him suffer, What would you do?  ISABELLA. As much for my poor brother as myself. That is, were I under the terms of death, Th’ impression of keen whips I’d wear as rubies, And strip myself to death as to a bed That longing have been sick for, ere I’d yield My body up to shame.  ANGELO. Then must your brother die.  ISABELLA. And ’twere the cheaper way. Better it were a brother died at once Than that a sister, by redeeming him, Should die for ever.  ANGELO. Were not you then as cruel as the sentence That you have slandered so?  ISABELLA. Ignominy in ransom and free pardon Are of two houses. Lawful mercy Is nothing kin to foul redemption.  ANGELO. You seemed of late to make the law a tyrant, And rather proved the sliding of your brother A merriment than a vice.  ISABELLA. O, pardon me, my lord. It oft falls out, To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean. I something do excuse the thing I hate For his advantage that I dearly love.  ANGELO. We are all frail.  ISABELLA. Else let my brother die, If not a feodary but only he Owe and succeed by weakness.  ANGELO. Nay, women are frail too.  ISABELLA. Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves, Which are as easy broke as they make forms. Women?—Help, heaven! Men their creation mar In profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail; For we are soft as our complexions are, And credulous to false prints.  ANGELO. I think it well. And from this testimony of your own sex, Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger Than faults may shake our frames, let me be bold. I do arrest your words. Be that you are, That is, a woman. If you be more, you’re none. If you be one, as you are well expressed By all external warrants, show it now By putting on the destined livery.  ISABELLA. I have no tongue but one. Gentle my lord, Let me intreat you speak the former language.  ANGELO. Plainly conceive, I love you.  ISABELLA. My brother did love Juliet, And you tell me that he shall die for ’t.  ANGELO. He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.  ISABELLA. I know your virtue hath a license in’t, Which seems a little fouler than it is, To pluck on others.  ANGELO. Believe me, on mine honour, My words express my purpose.  ISABELLA. Ha! Little honour to be much believed, And most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming! I will proclaim thee, Angelo, look for’t. Sign me a present pardon for my brother Or with an outstretched throat I’ll tell the world aloud What man thou art.  ANGELO. Who will believe thee, Isabel? My unsoiled name, th’ austereness of my life, My vouch against you, and my place i’ th’ state Will so your accusation overweigh That you shall stifle in your own report, And smell of calumny. I have begun, And now I give my sensual race the rein. Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite; Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes That banish what they sue for. Redeem thy brother By yielding up thy body to my will; Or else he must not only die the death, But thy unkindness shall his death draw out To ling’ring sufferance. Answer me tomorrow, Or, by the affection that now guides me most, I’ll prove a tyrant to him. As for you, Say what you can, my false o’erweighs your true.  [_Exit._]  ISABELLA. To whom should I complain? Did I tell this, Who would believe me? O perilous mouths, That bear in them one and the self-same tongue Either of condemnation or approof, Bidding the law make curtsy to their will, Hooking both right and wrong to th’ appetite, To follow as it draws! I’ll to my brother. Though he hath fall’n by prompture of the blood, Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour That, had he twenty heads to tender down On twenty bloody blocks, he’d yield them up Before his sister should her body stoop To such abhorred pollution. Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die. More than our brother is our chastity. I’ll tell him yet of Angelo’s request, And fit his mind to death, for his soul’s rest.  [_Exit._]
  ACT III  SCENE I. A room in the prison.
Enter Duke, Claudio and Provost.  DUKE. So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?  CLAUDIO. The miserable have no other medicine But only hope. I have hope to live, and am prepared to die.  DUKE. Be absolute for death. Either death or life Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life: If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing That none but fools would keep. A breath thou art, Servile to all the skyey influences That dost this habitation where thou keep’st Hourly afflict. Merely, thou art death’s fool; For him thou labour’st by thy flight to shun, And yet runn’st toward him still. Thou art not noble; For all th’ accommodations that thou bear’st Are nursed by baseness. Thou’rt by no means valiant; For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep, And that thou oft provok’st, yet grossly fear’st Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself; For thou exists on many a thousand grains That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not; For what thou hast not, still thou striv’st to get, And what thou hast, forget’st. Thou art not certain; For thy complexion shifts to strange effects After the moon. If thou art rich, thou’rt poor; For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows, Thou bear’st thy heavy riches but a journey, And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none; For thine own bowels which do call thee sire, The mere effusion of thy proper loins, Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age, But as it were an after-dinner’s sleep Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich, Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty To make thy riches pleasant. What’s yet in this That bears the name of life? Yet in this life Lie hid more thousand deaths; yet death we fear, That makes these odds all even.  CLAUDIO. I humbly thank you. To sue to live, I find I seek to die, And seeking death, find life. Let it come on.  ISABELLA. [_Within_.] What ho! Peace here; grace and good company!  PROVOST. Who’s there? Come in. The wish deserves a welcome.  DUKE. Dear sir, ere long I’ll visit you again.  CLAUDIO. Most holy sir, I thank you.  Enter Isabella.  ISABELLA. My business is a word or two with Claudio.  PROVOST. And very welcome. Look, signior, here’s your sister.  DUKE. Provost, a word with you.  PROVOST. As many as you please.  DUKE. Bring me to hear them speak, where I may be concealed.  [_Exeunt Duke and Provost._]  CLAUDIO. Now, sister, what’s the comfort?  ISABELLA. Why, As all comforts are, most good, most good indeed. Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven, Intends you for his swift ambassador, Where you shall be an everlasting leiger. Therefore your best appointment make with speed; Tomorrow you set on.  CLAUDIO. Is there no remedy?  ISABELLA. None, but such remedy as, to save a head, To cleave a heart in twain.  CLAUDIO. But is there any?  ISABELLA. Yes, brother, you may live. There is a devilish mercy in the judge, If you’ll implore it, that will free your life, But fetter you till death.  CLAUDIO. Perpetual durance?  ISABELLA. Ay, just; perpetual durance; a restraint, Though all the world’s vastidity you had, To a determined scope.  CLAUDIO. But in what nature?  ISABELLA. In such a one as, you consenting to’t, Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear, And leave you naked.  CLAUDIO. Let me know the point.  ISABELLA. O, I do fear thee, Claudio, and I quake, Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain, And six or seven winters more respect Than a perpetual honour. Dar’st thou die? The sense of death is most in apprehension; And the poor beetle that we tread upon In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great As when a giant dies.  CLAUDIO. Why give you me this shame? Think you I can a resolution fetch From flowery tenderness? If I must die, I will encounter darkness as a bride And hug it in mine arms.  ISABELLA. There spake my brother! There my father’s grave Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die. Thou art too noble to conserve a life In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy, Whose settled visage and deliberate word Nips youth i’ th’ head, and follies doth enew As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil. His filth within being cast, he would appear A pond as deep as hell.  CLAUDIO. The precise Angelo?  ISABELLA. O, ’tis the cunning livery of hell The damned’st body to invest and cover In precise guards! Dost thou think, Claudio, If I would yield him my virginity Thou mightst be freed?  CLAUDIO. O heavens, it cannot be.  ISABELLA. Yes, he would give it thee, from this rank offence, So to offend him still. This night’s the time That I should do what I abhor to name, Or else thou diest tomorrow.  CLAUDIO. Thou shalt not do’t.  ISABELLA. O, were it but my life, I’d throw it down for your deliverance As frankly as a pin.  CLAUDIO. Thanks, dear Isabel.  ISABELLA. Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.  CLAUDIO. Yes. Has he affections in him That thus can make him bite the law by th’ nose When he would force it? Sure it is no sin; Or of the deadly seven it is the least.  ISABELLA. Which is the least?  CLAUDIO. If it were damnable, he being so wise, Why would he for the momentary trick Be perdurably fined? O Isabel!  ISABELLA. What says my brother?  CLAUDIO. Death is a fearful thing.  ISABELLA. And shamed life a hateful.  CLAUDIO. Ay, but to die, and go we know not where; To lie in cold obstruction, and to rot; This sensible warm motion to become A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside In thrilling regions of thick-ribbed ice; To be imprisoned in the viewless winds And blown with restless violence round about The pendent world; or to be worse than worst Of those that lawless and incertain thought Imagine howling—’tis too horrible. The weariest and most loathed worldly life That age, ache, penury, and imprisonment Can lay on nature is a paradise To what we fear of death.  ISABELLA. Alas, alas!  CLAUDIO. Sweet sister, let me live. What sin you do to save a brother’s life, Nature dispenses with the deed so far That it becomes a virtue.  ISABELLA. O, you beast! O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch! Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice? Is’t not a kind of incest to take life From thine own sister’s shame? What should I think? Heaven shield my mother played my father fair, For such a warped slip of wilderness Ne’er issued from his blood. Take my defiance, Die, perish! Might but my bending down Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed. I’ll pray a thousand prayers for thy death, No word to save thee.  CLAUDIO. Nay, hear me, Isabel.  ISABELLA. O fie, fie, fie! Thy sin’s not accidental, but a trade. Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd. ’Tis best that thou diest quickly.  [_Going._]  CLAUDIO. O, hear me, Isabella.  Enter Duke as a Friar.  DUKE. Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word.  ISABELLA. What is your will?  DUKE. Might you dispense with your leisure, I would by and by have some speech with you. The satisfaction I would require is likewise your own benefit.  ISABELLA. I have no superfluous leisure, my stay must be stolen out of other affairs, but I will attend you a while.  DUKE. [_To Claudio aside_.] Son, I have overheard what hath passed between you and your sister. Angelo had never the purpose to corrupt her; only he hath made an assay of her virtue, to practise his judgement with the disposition of natures. She, having the truth of honour in her, hath made him that gracious denial which he is most glad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I know this to be true; therefore prepare yourself to death. Do not satisfy your resolution with hopes that are fallible. Tomorrow you must die; go to your knees and make ready.  CLAUDIO. Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love with life that I will sue to be rid of it.  DUKE. Hold you there. Farewell.  [_Exit Claudio._]  Enter Provost.  Provost, a word with you.  PROVOST. What’s your will, father?  DUKE. That, now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me a while with the maid; my mind promises with my habit no loss shall touch her by my company.  PROVOST. In good time.  [_Exit Provost._]  DUKE. The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good. The goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in goodness; but grace, being the soul of your complexion, shall keep the body of it ever fair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you, fortune hath conveyed to my understanding; and, but that frailty hath examples for his falling, I should wonder at Angelo. How will you do to content this substitute, and to save your brother?  ISABELLA. I am now going to resolve him. I had rather my brother die by the law than my son should be unlawfully born. But, O, how much is the good Duke deceived in Angelo! If ever he return, and I can speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or discover his government.  DUKE. That shall not be much amiss. Yet, as the matter now stands, he will avoid your accusation: he made trial of you only. Therefore fasten your ear on my advisings, to the love I have in doing good, a remedy presents itself. I do make myself believe that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged lady a merited benefit; redeem your brother from the angry law; do no stain to your own gracious person; and much please the absent Duke, if peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of this business.  ISABELLA. Let me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to do anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.  DUKE. Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have you not heard speak of Mariana, the sister of Frederick, the great soldier who miscarried at sea?  ISABELLA. I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name.  DUKE. She should this Angelo have married, was affianced to her oath, and the nuptial appointed. Between which time of the contract and limit of the solemnity, her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea, having in that perished vessel the dowry of his sister. But mark how heavily this befell to the poor gentlewoman. There she lost a noble and renowned brother, in his love toward her ever most kind and natural; with him, the portion and sinew of her fortune, her marriage dowry; with both, her combinate husband, this well-seeming Angelo.  ISABELLA. Can this be so? Did Angelo so leave her?  DUKE. Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them with his comfort, swallowed his vows whole, pretending in her discoveries of dishonour; in few, bestowed her on her own lamentation, which she yet wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears, is washed with them, but relents not.  ISABELLA. What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from the world! What corruption in this life, that it will let this man live! But how out of this can she avail?  DUKE. It is a rupture that you may easily heal, and the cure of it not only saves your brother, but keeps you from dishonour in doing it.  ISABELLA. Show me how, good father.  DUKE. This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance of her first affection. His unjust unkindness, that in all reason should have quenched her love, hath, like an impediment in the current, made it more violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer his requiring with a plausible obedience; agree with his demands to the point. Only refer yourself to this advantage: first, that your stay with him may not be long; that the time may have all shadow and silence in it; and the place answer to convenience. This being granted in course, and now follows all. We shall advise this wronged maid to stead up your appointment, go in your place. If the encounter acknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to her recompense; and here, by this, is your brother saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana advantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid will I frame and make fit for his attempt. If you think well to carry this as you may, the doubleness of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof. What think you of it?  ISABELLA. The image of it gives me content already, and I trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection.  DUKE. It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily to Angelo; if for this night he entreat you to his bed, give him promise of satisfaction. I will presently to Saint Luke’s; there at the moated grange resides this dejected Mariana. At that place call upon me; and dispatch with Angelo, that it may be quickly.  ISABELLA. I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father.  [_Exit Isabella._]  SCENE II. The street before the prison.  Enter Elbow, Pompey and Officers.  ELBOW. Nay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you will needs buy and sell men and women like beasts, we shall have all the world drink brown and white bastard.  DUKE. O heavens, what stuff is here?  POMPEY. ’Twas never merry world since, of two usuries, the merriest was put down, and the worser allowed by order of law a furred gown to keep him warm; and furred with fox on lambskins too, to signify that craft, being richer than innocency, stands for the facing.  ELBOW. Come your way, sir.—Bless you, good father friar.  DUKE. And you, good brother father. What offence hath this man made you, sir?  ELBOW. Marry, sir, he hath offended the law; and, sir, we take him to be a thief too, sir; for we have found upon him, sir, a strange picklock, which we have sent to the deputy.  DUKE. Fie, sirrah, a bawd, a wicked bawd; The evil that thou causest to be done, That is thy means to live. Do thou but think What ’tis to cram a maw or clothe a back From such a filthy vice. Say to thyself, From their abominable and beastly touches I drink, I eat, array myself, and live. Canst thou believe thy living is a life, So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend.  POMPEY. Indeed, it does stink in some sort, sir. But yet, sir, I would prove—  DUKE. Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin, Thou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer. Correction and instruction must both work Ere this rude beast will profit.  ELBOW. He must before the deputy, sir; he has given him warning. The deputy cannot abide a whoremaster. If he be a whoremonger and comes before him, he were as good go a mile on his errand.  DUKE. That we were all, as some would seem to be, Free from our faults, as faults from seeming, free!  ELBOW. His neck will come to your waist—a cord, sir.  Enter Lucio.  POMPEY. I spy comfort, I cry bail! Here’s a gentleman, and a friend of mine.  LUCIO. How now, noble Pompey? What, at the wheels of Caesar? Art thou led in triumph? What, is there none of Pygmalion’s images, newly made woman, to be had now, for putting the hand in the pocket and extracting it clutched? What reply, ha? What say’st thou to this tune, matter, and method? Is’t not drowned i’ th’ last rain, ha? What say’st thou, trot? Is the world as it was, man? Which is the way? Is it sad and few words? Or how? The trick of it?  DUKE. Still thus, and thus; still worse!  LUCIO. How doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? Procures she still, ha?  POMPEY. Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she is herself in the tub.  LUCIO. Why, ’tis good. It is the right of it. It must be so. Ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd; an unshunned consequence; it must be so. Art going to prison, Pompey?  POMPEY. Yes, faith, sir.  LUCIO. Why, ’tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell. Go, say I sent thee thither. For debt, Pompey? Or how?  ELBOW. For being a bawd, for being a bawd.  LUCIO. Well, then, imprison him. If imprisonment be the due of a bawd, why, ’tis his right. Bawd is he doubtless, and of antiquity, too. Bawd born. Farewell, good Pompey. Commend me to the prison, Pompey. You will turn good husband now, Pompey; you will keep the house.  POMPEY. I hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail.  LUCIO. No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear. I will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage. If you take it not patiently, why, your mettle is the more. Adieu, trusty Pompey.—Bless you, friar.  DUKE. And you.  LUCIO. Does Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?  ELBOW. Come your ways, sir, come.  POMPEY. You will not bail me then, sir?  LUCIO. Then, Pompey, nor now.—What news abroad, friar? What news?  ELBOW. Come your ways, sir, come.  LUCIO. Go to kennel, Pompey, go.  [_Exeunt Elbow, Pompey and Officers._]  What news, friar, of the Duke?  DUKE. I know none. Can you tell me of any?  LUCIO. Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other some, he is in Rome. But where is he, think you?  DUKE. I know not where, but wheresoever, I wish him well.  LUCIO. It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the state and usurp the beggary he was never born to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence. He puts transgression to’t.  DUKE. He does well in’t.  LUCIO. A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him. Something too crabbed that way, friar.  DUKE. It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.  LUCIO. Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred; it is well allied; but it is impossible to extirp it quite, friar, till eating and drinking be put down. They say this Angelo was not made by man and woman after this downright way of creation. Is it true, think you?  DUKE. How should he be made, then?  LUCIO. Some report a sea-maid spawned him; some, that he was begot between two stockfishes. But it is certain that when he makes water, his urine is congealed ice; that I know to be true. And he is a motion ungenerative; that’s infallible.  DUKE. You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.  LUCIO. Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a man! Would the Duke that is absent have done this? Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing a thousand. He had some feeling of the sport; he knew the service, and that instructed him to mercy.  DUKE. I never heard the absent Duke much detected for women; he was not inclined that way.  LUCIO. O, sir, you are deceived.  DUKE. ’Tis not possible.  LUCIO. Who, not the Duke? Yes, your beggar of fifty; and his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish. The Duke had crotchets in him. He would be drunk too, that let me inform you.  DUKE. You do him wrong, surely.  LUCIO. Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the Duke; and I believe I know the cause of his withdrawing.  DUKE. What, I prithee, might be the cause?  LUCIO. No, pardon. ’Tis a secret must be locked within the teeth and the lips. But this I can let you understand: the greater file of the subject held the Duke to be wise.  DUKE. Wise? Why, no question but he was.  LUCIO. A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.  DUKE. Either this is envy in you, folly, or mistaking. The very stream of his life, and the business he hath helmed, must upon a warranted need give him a better proclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his own bringings-forth, and he shall appear to the envious a scholar, a statesman, and a soldier. Therefore you speak unskilfully. Or, if your knowledge be more, it is much darkened in your malice.  LUCIO. Sir, I know him, and I love him.  DUKE. Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with dearer love.  LUCIO. Come, sir, I know what I know.  DUKE. I can hardly believe that, since you know not what you speak. But, if ever the Duke return, as our prayers are he may, let me desire you to make your answer before him. If it be honest you have spoke, you have courage to maintain it. I am bound to call upon you, and I pray you your name?  LUCIO. Sir, my name is Lucio, well known to the Duke.  DUKE. He shall know you better, sir, if I may live to report you.  LUCIO. I fear you not.  DUKE. O, you hope the Duke will return no more; or you imagine me too unhurtful an opposite. But indeed, I can do you little harm. You’ll forswear this again.  LUCIO. I’ll be hanged first! Thou art deceived in me, friar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell if Claudio die tomorrow or no?  DUKE. Why should he die, sir?  LUCIO. Why? For filling a bottle with a tun-dish. I would the Duke we talk of were returned again. This ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with continency. Sparrows must not build in his house-eaves because they are lecherous. The Duke yet would have dark deeds darkly answered. He would never bring them to light. Would he were returned! Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing. Farewell, good friar, I prithee pray for me. The Duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on Fridays. He’s now past it; yet, and, I say to thee, he would mouth with a beggar though she smelt brown bread and garlic. Say that I said so. Farewell.  [_Exit._]  DUKE. No might nor greatness in mortality Can censure ’scape. Back-wounding calumny The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue? But who comes here?  Enter Escalus, Provost and Officers with Mistress Overdone, a Bawd.  ESCALUS. Go, away with her to prison.  BAWD. Good my lord, be good to me. Your honour is accounted a merciful man, good my lord.  ESCALUS. Double and treble admonition, and still forfeit in the same kind? This would make mercy swear and play the tyrant.  PROVOST. A bawd of eleven years’ continuance, may it please your honour.  BAWD. My lord, this is one Lucio’s information against me. Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in the Duke’s time; he promised her marriage. His child is a year and a quarter old come Philip and Jacob. I have kept it myself; and see how he goes about to abuse me.  ESCALUS. That fellow is a fellow of much license. Let him be called before us. Away with her to prison. Go to, no more words.  [_Exeunt Officers with Bawd._]  Provost, my brother Angelo will not be altered; Claudio must die tomorrow. Let him be furnished with divines, and have all charitable preparation. If my brother wrought by my pity, it should not be so with him.  PROVOST. So please you, this friar hath been with him, and advised him for th’ entertainment of death.  ESCALUS. Good even, good father.  DUKE. Bliss and goodness on you!  ESCALUS. Of whence are you?  DUKE. Not of this country, though my chance is now To use it for my time. I am a brother Of gracious order, late come from the See In special business from his Holiness.  ESCALUS. What news abroad i’ th’ world?  DUKE. None, but that there is so great a fever on goodness that the dissolution of it must cure it. Novelty is only in request, and as it is as dangerous to be aged in any kind of course as it is virtuous to be constant in any undertaking. There is scarce truth enough alive to make societies secure; but security enough to make fellowships accursed. Much upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This news is old enough, yet it is every day’s news. I pray you, sir, of what disposition was the Duke?  ESCALUS. One that, above all other strifes, contended especially to know himself.  DUKE. What pleasure was he given to?  ESCALUS. Rather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry at anything which professed to make him rejoice. A gentleman of all temperance. But leave we him to his events, with a prayer they may prove prosperous, and let me desire to know how you find Claudio prepared. I am made to understand that you have lent him visitation.  DUKE. He professes to have received no sinister measure from his judge, but most willingly humbles himself to the determination of justice. Yet had he framed to himself, by the instruction of his frailty, many deceiving promises of life, which I, by my good leisure, have discredited to him, and now he is resolved to die.  ESCALUS. You have paid the heavens your function, and the prisoner the very debt of your calling. I have laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest shore of my modesty, but my brother justice have I found so severe that he hath forced me to tell him he is indeed Justice.  DUKE. If his own life answer the straitness of his proceeding, it shall become him well; wherein if he chance to fail, he hath sentenced himself.  ESCALUS. I am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well.  DUKE. Peace be with you.  [_Exeunt Escalus and Provost._]  He who the sword of heaven will bear Should be as holy as severe, Pattern in himself to know, Grace to stand, and virtue go; More nor less to others paying Than by self-offences weighing. Shame to him whose cruel striking Kills for faults of his own liking! Twice treble shame on Angelo, To weed my vice, and let his grow! O, what may man within him hide, Though angel on the outward side! How may likeness, made in crimes, Make practice on the times, To draw with idle spiders’ strings Most ponderous and substantial things! Craft against vice I must apply. With Angelo tonight shall lie His old betrothed but despised. So disguise shall, by th’ disguised, Pay with falsehood false exacting, And perform an old contracting.  [_Exit._]
  ACT IV  SCENE I. A room in Mariana’s house.
Enter Mariana and a Boy singing.                  SONG _  Take, O take those lips away,       That so sweetly were forsworn,   And those eyes, the break of day,       Lights that do mislead the morn.   But my kisses bring again,                 Bring again;   Seals of love, but sealed in vain,                 Sealed in vain._  Enter Duke as a Friar.  MARIANA. Break off thy song, and haste thee quick away; Here comes a man of comfort, whose advice Hath often stilled my brawling discontent.  [_Exit Boy._]  I cry you mercy, sir, and well could wish You had not found me here so musical. Let me excuse me, and believe me so, My mirth it much displeased, but pleased my woe.  DUKE. ’Tis good; though music oft hath such a charm To make bad good and good provoke to harm. I pray you tell me, hath anybody inquired for me here today? Much upon this time have I promised here to meet.  MARIANA. You have not been inquired after. I have sat here all day.  Enter Isabella.  DUKE. I do constantly believe you. The time is come even now. I shall crave your forbearance a little. Maybe I will call upon you anon for some advantage to yourself.  MARIANA. I am always bound to you.  [_Exit._]  DUKE. Very well met, and welcome. What is the news from this good deputy?  ISABELLA. He hath a garden circummured with brick, Whose western side is with a vineyard backed; And to that vineyard is a planched gate That makes his opening with this bigger key. This other doth command a little door Which from the vineyard to the garden leads; There have I made my promise, upon the Heavy middle of the night to call on him.  DUKE. But shall you on your knowledge find this way?  ISABELLA. I have ta’en a due and wary note upon’t; With whispering and most guilty diligence, In action all of precept, he did show me The way twice o’er.  DUKE. Are there no other tokens Between you ’greed concerning her observance?  ISABELLA. No, none, but only a repair i’ th’ dark, And that I have possessed him my most stay Can be but brief, for I have made him know I have a servant comes with me along, That stays upon me; whose persuasion is I come about my brother.  DUKE. ’Tis well borne up. I have not yet made known to Mariana A word of this.—What ho, within! Come forth.  Enter Mariana.  I pray you be acquainted with this maid; She comes to do you good.  ISABELLA. I do desire the like.  DUKE. Do you persuade yourself that I respect you?  MARIANA. Good friar, I know you do, and have found it.  DUKE. Take, then, this your companion by the hand, Who hath a story ready for your ear. I shall attend your leisure; but make haste. The vaporous night approaches.  MARIANA. Will’t please you walk aside?  [_Exeunt Mariana and Isabella._]  DUKE. O place and greatness, millions of false eyes Are stuck upon thee; volumes of report Run with these false, and most contrarious quest Upon thy doings; thousand escapes of wit Make thee the father of their idle dream And rack thee in their fancies.  Enter Mariana and Isabella.  Welcome; how agreed?  ISABELLA. She’ll take the enterprise upon her, father, If you advise it.  DUKE. It is not my consent, But my entreaty too.  ISABELLA. Little have you to say When you depart from him, but, soft and low, “Remember now my brother.”  MARIANA. Fear me not.  DUKE. Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all. He is your husband on a pre-contract. To bring you thus together ’tis no sin, Sith that the justice of your title to him Doth flourish the deceit. Come, let us go; Our corn’s to reap, for yet our tithe’s to sow.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. A room in the prison.  Enter Provost and Pompey.  PROVOST. Come hither, sirrah. Can you cut off a man’s head?  POMPEY. If the man be a bachelor, sir, I can; but if he be a married man, he’s his wife’s head, and I can never cut off a woman’s head.  PROVOST. Come, sir, leave me your snatches, and yield me a direct answer. Tomorrow morning are to die Claudio and Barnardine. Here is in our prison a common executioner, who in his office lacks a helper; if you will take it on you to assist him, it shall redeem you from your gyves; if not, you shall have your full time of imprisonment, and your deliverance with an unpitied whipping; for you have been a notorious bawd.  POMPEY. Sir, I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind, but yet I will be content to be a lawful hangman. I would be glad to receive some instruction from my fellow-partner.  PROVOST. What ho, Abhorson! Where’s Abhorson, there?  Enter Abhorson.  ABHORSON. Do you call, sir?  PROVOST. Sirrah, here’s a fellow will help you tomorrow in your execution. If you think it meet, compound with him by the year, and let him abide here with you; if not, use him for the present, and dismiss him. He cannot plead his estimation with you; he hath been a bawd.  ABHORSON. A bawd, sir? Fie upon him, he will discredit our mystery.  PROVOST. Go to, sir; you weigh equally. A feather will turn the scale.  [_Exit._]  POMPEY. Pray, sir, by your good favour—for surely, sir, a good favour you have, but that you have a hanging look—do you call, sir, your occupation a mystery?  ABHORSON. Ay, sir, a mystery.  POMPEY. Painting, sir, I have heard say, is a mystery; and your whores, sir, being members of my occupation, using painting, do prove my occupation a mystery. But what mystery there should be in hanging, if I should be hanged, I cannot imagine.  ABHORSON. Sir, it is a mystery.  POMPEY. Proof.  ABHORSON. Every true man’s apparel fits your thief. If it be too little for your thief, your true man thinks it big enough; if it be too big for your thief, your thief thinks it little enough. So every true man’s apparel fits your thief.  Enter Provost.  PROVOST. Are you agreed?  POMPEY. Sir, I will serve him; for I do find your hangman is a more penitent trade than your bawd. He doth oftener ask forgiveness.  PROVOST. You, sirrah, provide your block and your axe tomorrow four o’clock.  ABHORSON. Come on, bawd. I will instruct thee in my trade. Follow.  POMPEY. I do desire to learn, sir; and I hope, if you have occasion to use me for your own turn, you shall find me yare. For truly, sir, for your kindness I owe you a good turn.  PROVOST. Call hither Barnardine and Claudio.  [_Exeunt Abhorson and Pompey._]  Th’ one has my pity; not a jot the other, Being a murderer, though he were my brother.  Enter Claudio.  Look, here’s the warrant, Claudio, for thy death. ’Tis now dead midnight, and by eight tomorrow Thou must be made immortal. Where’s Barnardine?  CLAUDIO. As fast locked up in sleep as guiltless labour When it lies starkly in the traveller’s bones. He will not wake.  PROVOST. Who can do good on him? Well, go, prepare yourself. [_Knocking within_.] But hark, what noise? Heaven give your spirits comfort!  [_Exit Claudio. Knock within._]  By and by!— I hope it is some pardon or reprieve For the most gentle Claudio.  Enter Duke.  Welcome, father.  DUKE. The best and wholesom’st spirits of the night Envelop you, good Provost! Who called here of late?  PROVOST. None, since the curfew rung.  DUKE. Not Isabel?  PROVOST. No.  DUKE. They will then, ere’t be long.  PROVOST. What comfort is for Claudio?  DUKE. There’s some in hope.  PROVOST. It is a bitter deputy.  DUKE. Not so, not so. His life is paralleled Even with the stroke and line of his great justice. He doth with holy abstinence subdue That in himself which he spurs on his power To qualify in others. Were he mealed with that Which he corrects, then were he tyrannous; But this being so, he’s just.  [_Knocking within. Provost goes to the door._]  Now are they come. This is a gentle provost. Seldom when The steeled gaoler is the friend of men.  [_Knocking within_.]  How now? What noise? That spirit’s possessed with haste That wounds th’ unsisting postern with these strokes.  Provost returns.  PROVOST. There he must stay until the officer Arise to let him in. He is called up.  DUKE. Have you no countermand for Claudio yet, But he must die tomorrow?  PROVOST. None, sir, none.  DUKE. As near the dawning, Provost, as it is, You shall hear more ere morning.  PROVOST. Happily You something know, yet I believe there comes No countermand. No such example have we. Besides, upon the very siege of justice Lord Angelo hath to the public ear Professed the contrary.  Enter a Messenger.  This is his Lordship’s man.  DUKE. And here comes Claudio’s pardon.  MESSENGER. My lord hath sent you this note, and by me this further charge: that you swerve not from the smallest article of it, neither in time, matter, or other circumstance. Good morrow; for, as I take it, it is almost day.  PROVOST. I shall obey him.  [_Exit Messenger._]  DUKE. [_Aside_.] This is his pardon, purchased by such sin For which the pardoner himself is in. Hence hath offence his quick celerity, When it is borne in high authority. When vice makes mercy, mercy’s so extended That for the fault’s love is th’ offender friended. Now, sir, what news?  PROVOST. I told you: Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remiss in mine office, awakens me with this unwonted putting-on; methinks strangely, for he hath not used it before.  DUKE. Pray you, let’s hear.  PROVOST. [_Reads_.] _Whatsoever you may hear to the contrary, let Claudio be executed by four of the clock, and in the afternoon, Barnardine. For my better satisfaction, let me have Claudio’s head sent me by five. Let this be duly performed, with a thought that more depends on it than we must yet deliver. Thus fail not to do your office, as you will answer it at your peril._ What say you to this, sir?  DUKE. What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in th’ afternoon?  PROVOST. A Bohemian born, but here nursed up and bred; one that is a prisoner nine years old.  DUKE. How came it that the absent Duke had not either delivered him to his liberty, or executed him? I have heard it was ever his manner to do so.  PROVOST. His friends still wrought reprieves for him; and indeed, his fact till now in the government of Lord Angelo, came not to an undoubtful proof.  DUKE. It is now apparent?  PROVOST. Most manifest, and not denied by himself.  DUKE. Hath he borne himself penitently in prison? How seems he to be touched?  PROVOST. A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but as a drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearless of what’s past, present, or to come; insensible of mortality and desperately mortal.  DUKE. He wants advice.  PROVOST. He will hear none. He hath evermore had the liberty of the prison; give him leave to escape hence, he would not. Drunk many times a day, if not many days entirely drunk. We have very oft awaked him, as if to carry him to execution, and showed him a seeming warrant for it. It hath not moved him at all.  DUKE. More of him anon. There is written in your brow, Provost, honesty and constancy; if I read it not truly, my ancient skill beguiles me. But in the boldness of my cunning I will lay myself in hazard. Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is no greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath sentenced him. To make you understand this in a manifested effect, I crave but four days’ respite, for the which you are to do me both a present and a dangerous courtesy.  PROVOST. Pray, sir, in what?  DUKE. In the delaying death.  PROVOST. Alack, how may I do it? Having the hour limited, and an express command, under penalty, to deliver his head in the view of Angelo? I may make my case as Claudio’s, to cross this in the smallest.  DUKE. By the vow of mine order, I warrant you, if my instructions may be your guide. Let this Barnardine be this morning executed, and his head borne to Angelo.  PROVOST. Angelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour.  DUKE. O, death’s a great disguiser, and you may add to it. Shave the head and tie the beard, and say it was the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his death. You know the course is common. If anything fall to you upon this, more than thanks and good fortune, by the saint whom I profess, I will plead against it with my life.  PROVOST. Pardon me, good father; it is against my oath.  DUKE. Were you sworn to the Duke, or to the Deputy?  PROVOST. To him and to his substitutes.  DUKE. You will think you have made no offence if the Duke avouch the justice of your dealing?  PROVOST. But what likelihood is in that?  DUKE. Not a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I see you fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor persuasion, can with ease attempt you, I will go further than I meant, to pluck all fears out of you. Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of the Duke. You know the character, I doubt not, and the signet is not strange to you.  PROVOST. I know them both.  DUKE. The contents of this is the return of the Duke; you shall anon over-read it at your pleasure, where you shall find within these two days he will be here. This is a thing that Angelo knows not; for he this very day receives letters of strange tenour, perchance of the Duke’s death, perchance entering into some monastery; but, by chance, nothing of what is writ. Look, th’ unfolding star calls up the shepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how these things should be. All difficulties are but easy when they are known. Call your executioner, and off with Barnardine’s head. I will give him a present shrift, and advise him for a better place. Yet you are amazed; but this shall absolutely resolve you. Come away; it is almost clear dawn.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. Another room in the same.  Enter Pompey.  POMPEY. I am as well acquainted here as I was in our house of profession. One would think it were Mistress Overdone’s own house, for here be many of her old customers. First, here’s young Master Rash; he’s in for a commodity of brown paper and old ginger, nine score and seventeen pounds; of which he made five marks ready money. Marry, then ginger was not much in request, for the old women were all dead. Then is there here one Master Caper, at the suit of Master Three-pile the mercer, for some four suits of peach-coloured satin, which now peaches him a beggar. Then have we here young Dizie, and young Master Deep-vow, and Master Copperspur, and Master Starve-lackey, the rapier and dagger man, and young Drop-heir that killed lusty Pudding, and Master Forthright the tilter, and brave Master Shoe-tie the great traveller, and wild Half-can that stabbed Pots, and I think forty more, all great doers in our trade, and are now “for the Lord’s sake.”  Enter Abhorson.  ABHORSON. Sirrah, bring Barnardine hither.  POMPEY. Master Barnardine! You must rise and be hanged, Master Barnardine.  ABHORSON. What ho, Barnardine!  BARNARDINE. [_Within_.] A pox o’ your throats! Who makes that noise there? What are you?  POMPEY. Your friends, sir; the hangman. You must be so good, sir, to rise and be put to death.  BARNARDINE. [_Within_.] Away, you rogue, away; I am sleepy.  ABHORSON. Tell him he must awake, and that quickly too.  POMPEY. Pray, Master Barnardine, awake till you are executed, and sleep afterwards.  ABHORSON. Go in to him, and fetch him out.  POMPEY. He is coming, sir, he is coming. I hear his straw rustle.  Enter Barnardine.  ABHORSON. Is the axe upon the block, sirrah?  POMPEY. Very ready, sir.  BARNARDINE. How now, Abhorson? What’s the news with you?  ABHORSON. Truly, sir, I would desire you to clap into your prayers; for, look you, the warrant’s come.  BARNARDINE. You rogue, I have been drinking all night; I am not fitted for’t.  POMPEY. O, the better, sir; for he that drinks all night and is hanged betimes in the morning may sleep the sounder all the next day.  Enter Duke.  ABHORSON. Look you, sir, here comes your ghostly father. Do we jest now, think you?  DUKE. Sir, induced by my charity, and hearing how hastily you are to depart, I am come to advise you, comfort you, and pray with you.  BARNARDINE. Friar, not I. I have been drinking hard all night, and I will have more time to prepare me, or they shall beat out my brains with billets. I will not consent to die this day, that’s certain.  DUKE. O, sir, you must; and therefore I beseech you Look forward on the journey you shall go.  BARNARDINE. I swear I will not die today for any man’s persuasion.  DUKE. But hear you—  BARNARDINE. Not a word. If you have anything to say to me, come to my ward, for thence will not I today.  [_Exit._]  DUKE. Unfit to live or die. O gravel heart! After him, fellows; bring him to the block.  [_Exeunt Abhorson and Pompey._]  Enter Provost.  PROVOST. Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner?  DUKE. A creature unprepared, unmeet for death; And to transport him in the mind he is Were damnable.  PROVOST. Here in the prison, father, There died this morning of a cruel fever One Ragozine, a most notorious pirate, A man of Claudio’s years; his beard and head Just of his colour. What if we do omit This reprobate till he were well inclined, And satisfy the Deputy with the visage Of Ragozine, more like to Claudio?  DUKE. O, ’tis an accident that heaven provides! Dispatch it presently; the hour draws on Prefixed by Angelo. See this be done, And sent according to command, whiles I Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die.  PROVOST. This shall be done, good father, presently. But Barnardine must die this afternoon; And how shall we continue Claudio, To save me from the danger that might come If he were known alive?  DUKE. Let this be done: Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine and Claudio. Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting To yonder generation, you shall find Your safety manifested.  PROVOST. I am your free dependant.  DUKE. Quick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo.  [_Exit Provost._]  Now will I write letters to Angelo, The Provost, he shall bear them, whose contents Shall witness to him I am near at home; And that by great injunctions I am bound To enter publicly. Him I’ll desire To meet me at the consecrated fount, A league below the city; and from thence, By cold gradation and well-balanced form. We shall proceed with Angelo.  Enter Provost.  PROVOST. Here is the head; I’ll carry it myself.  DUKE. Convenient is it. Make a swift return; For I would commune with you of such things That want no ear but yours.  PROVOST. I’ll make all speed.  [_Exit._]  ISABELLA. [_Within_.] Peace, ho, be here!  DUKE. The tongue of Isabel. She’s come to know If yet her brother’s pardon be come hither. But I will keep her ignorant of her good, To make her heavenly comforts of despair When it is least expected.  Enter Isabella.  ISABELLA. Ho, by your leave!  DUKE. Good morning to you, fair and gracious daughter.  ISABELLA. The better, given me by so holy a man. Hath yet the Deputy sent my brother’s pardon?  DUKE. He hath released him, Isabel, from the world. His head is off, and sent to Angelo.  ISABELLA. Nay, but it is not so.  DUKE. It is no other. Show your wisdom, daughter, in your close patience.  ISABELLA. O, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!  DUKE. You shall not be admitted to his sight.  ISABELLA. Unhappy Claudio! Wretched Isabel! Injurious world! Most damned Angelo!  DUKE. This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot. Forbear it, therefore; give your cause to heaven. Mark what I say, which you shall find By every syllable a faithful verity. The Duke comes home tomorrow;—nay, dry your eyes. One of our convent, and his confessor, Gives me this instance. Already he hath carried Notice to Escalus and Angelo, Who do prepare to meet him at the gates, There to give up their power. If you can, pace your wisdom In that good path that I would wish it go, And you shall have your bosom on this wretch, Grace of the Duke, revenges to your heart, And general honour.  ISABELLA. I am directed by you.  DUKE. This letter, then, to Friar Peter give; ’Tis that he sent me of the Duke’s return. Say, by this token, I desire his company At Mariana’s house tonight. Her cause and yours I’ll perfect him withal, and he shall bring you Before the Duke; and to the head of Angelo Accuse him home and home. For my poor self, I am combined by a sacred vow, And shall be absent. Wend you with this letter. Command these fretting waters from your eyes With a light heart; trust not my holy order, If I pervert your course.—Who’s here?  Enter Lucio.  LUCIO. Good even. Friar, where is the Provost?  DUKE. Not within, sir.  LUCIO. O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see thine eyes so red. Thou must be patient. I am fain to dine and sup with water and bran. I dare not for my head fill my belly. One fruitful meal would set me to’t. But they say the Duke will be here tomorrow. By my troth, Isabel, I loved thy brother. If the old fantastical duke of dark corners had been at home, he had lived.  [_Exit Isabella._]  DUKE. Sir, the Duke is marvellous little beholding to your reports; but the best is, he lives not in them.  LUCIO. Friar, thou knowest not the Duke so well as I do. He’s a better woodman than thou tak’st him for.  DUKE. Well, you’ll answer this one day. Fare ye well.  LUCIO. Nay, tarry, I’ll go along with thee. I can tell thee pretty tales of the Duke.  DUKE. You have told me too many of him already, sir, if they be true; if not true, none were enough.  LUCIO. I was once before him for getting a wench with child.  DUKE. Did you such a thing?  LUCIO. Yes, marry, did I; but I was fain to forswear it. They would else have married me to the rotten medlar.  DUKE. Sir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well.  LUCIO. By my troth, I’ll go with thee to the lane’s end. If bawdy talk offend you, we’ll have very little of it. Nay, friar, I am a kind of burr; I shall stick.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IV. A room in Angelo’s house.  Enter Angelo and Escalus.  ESCALUS. Every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other.  ANGELO. In most uneven and distracted manner. His actions show much like to madness; pray heaven his wisdom be not tainted. And why meet him at the gates and redeliver our authorities there?  ESCALUS. I guess not.  ANGELO. And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his entering, that if any crave redress of injustice, they should exhibit their petitions in the street?  ESCALUS. He shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch of complaints, and to deliver us from devices hereafter, which shall then have no power to stand against us.  ANGELO. Well, I beseech you, let it be proclaimed. Betimes i’ th’ morn I’ll call you at your house. Give notice to such men of sort and suit As are to meet him.  ESCALUS. I shall, sir. Fare you well.  [_Exit._]  ANGELO. Good night. This deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnant And dull to all proceedings. A deflowered maid; And by an eminent body that enforced The law against it! But that her tender shame Will not proclaim against her maiden loss, How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no, For my authority bears so credent bulk That no particular scandal once can touch But it confounds the breather. He should have lived, Save that his riotous youth, with dangerous sense, Might in the times to come have ta’en revenge By so receiving a dishonoured life With ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived. Alack, when once our grace we have forgot, Nothing goes right; we would, and we would not.  [_Exit._]  SCENE V. Fields without the town.  Enter Duke, in his own habit, and Friar Peter.  DUKE. These letters at fit time deliver me. The Provost knows our purpose and our plot. The matter being afoot, keep your instruction And hold you ever to our special drift, Though sometimes you do blench from this to that As cause doth minister. Go call at Flavius’ house, And tell him where I stay. Give the like notice To Valencius, Rowland, and to Crassus, And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate. But send me Flavius first.  FRIAR PETER. It shall be speeded well.  [_Exit Friar Peter._]  Enter Varrius.  DUKE. I thank thee, Varrius, thou hast made good haste. Come, we will walk. There’s other of our friends Will greet us here anon. My gentle Varrius.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE VI. Street near the city gate.  Enter Isabella and Mariana.  ISABELLA. To speak so indirectly I am loath; I would say the truth, but to accuse him so That is your part; yet I am advised to do it, He says, to veil full purpose.  MARIANA. Be ruled by him.  ISABELLA. Besides, he tells me that, if peradventure He speak against me on the adverse side, I should not think it strange, for ’tis a physic That’s bitter to sweet end.  MARIANA. I would Friar Peter—  Enter Friar Peter.  ISABELLA. O, peace, the friar is come.  FRIAR PETER. Come, I have found you out a stand most fit, Where you may have such vantage on the Duke He shall not pass you. Twice have the trumpets sounded. The generous and gravest citizens Have hent the gates, and very near upon The Duke is entering. Therefore hence, away.  [_Exeunt._]
  ACT V  SCENE I. A public place near the city gate.
Enter at several doors Duke, Varrius, Lords; Angelo, Escalus, Lucio, Provost, Officers and Citizens.  DUKE. My very worthy cousin, fairly met. Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you.  ANGELO and ESCALUS. Happy return be to your royal grace!  DUKE. Many and hearty thankings to you both. We have made inquiry of you, and we hear Such goodness of your justice that our soul Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks, Forerunning more requital.  ANGELO. You make my bonds still greater.  DUKE. O, your desert speaks loud, and I should wrong it To lock it in the wards of covert bosom, When it deserves with characters of brass A forted residence ’gainst the tooth of time And rasure of oblivion. Give me your hand And let the subject see, to make them know That outward courtesies would fain proclaim Favours that keep within.—Come, Escalus, You must walk by us on our other hand. And good supporters are you.  Enter Friar Peter and Isabella.  FRIAR PETER. Now is your time. Speak loud, and kneel before him.  ISABELLA. Justice, O royal Duke! Vail your regard Upon a wronged—I would fain have said, a maid. O worthy prince, dishonour not your eye By throwing it on any other object Till you have heard me in my true complaint, And given me justice, justice, justice, justice!  DUKE. Relate your wrongs. In what? By whom? Be brief. Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice. Reveal yourself to him.  ISABELLA. O worthy Duke, You bid me seek redemption of the devil. Hear me yourself, for that which I must speak Must either punish me, not being believed, Or wring redress from you. Hear me, O hear me, here!  ANGELO. My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm. She hath been a suitor to me for her brother, Cut off by course of justice.  ISABELLA. By course of justice!  ANGELO. And she will speak most bitterly and strange.  ISABELLA. Most strange, but yet most truly will I speak. That Angelo’s forsworn, is it not strange? That Angelo’s a murderer, is’t not strange? That Angelo is an adulterous thief, An hypocrite, a virgin-violator, Is it not strange and strange?  DUKE. Nay, it is ten times strange.  ISABELLA. It is not truer he is Angelo Than this is all as true as it is strange. Nay, it is ten times true, for truth is truth To th’ end of reckoning.  DUKE. Away with her. Poor soul, She speaks this in th’ infirmity of sense.  ISABELLA. O Prince, I conjure thee, as thou believ’st There is another comfort than this world, That thou neglect me not with that opinion That I am touched with madness. Make not impossible That which but seems unlike. ’Tis not impossible But one, the wicked’st caitiff on the ground, May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute, As Angelo; even so may Angelo, In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms, Be an arch-villain. Believe it, royal Prince, If he be less, he’s nothing; but he’s more, Had I more name for badness.  DUKE. By mine honesty, If she be mad, as I believe no other, Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense, Such a dependency of thing on thing, As e’er I heard in madness.  ISABELLA. O gracious Duke, Harp not on that; nor do not banish reason For inequality; but let your reason serve To make the truth appear where it seems hid, And hide the false seems true.  DUKE. Many that are not mad Have, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say?  ISABELLA. I am the sister of one Claudio, Condemned upon the act of fornication To lose his head; condemned by Angelo. I, in probation of a sisterhood, Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio As then the messenger.  LUCIO. That’s I, an’t like your Grace. I came to her from Claudio and desired her To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo For her poor brother’s pardon.  ISABELLA. That’s he, indeed.  DUKE. You were not bid to speak.  LUCIO. No, my good lord, Nor wished to hold my peace.  DUKE. I wish you now, then; Pray you take note of it; and when you have A business for yourself, pray heaven you then Be perfect.  LUCIO. I warrant your honour.  DUKE. The warrant’s for yourself. Take heed to it.  ISABELLA. This gentleman told somewhat of my tale.  LUCIO. Right.  DUKE. It may be right, but you are i’ the wrong To speak before your time.—Proceed.  ISABELLA. I went To this pernicious caitiff deputy.  DUKE. That’s somewhat madly spoken.  ISABELLA. Pardon it; The phrase is to the matter.  DUKE. Mended again. The matter; proceed.  ISABELLA. In brief, to set the needless process by: How I persuaded, how I prayed and kneeled, How he refelled me, and how I replied— For this was of much length—the vile conclusion I now begin with grief and shame to utter. He would not, but by gift of my chaste body To his concupiscible intemperate lust, Release my brother; and after much debatement, My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour, And I did yield to him. But the next morn betimes, His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant For my poor brother’s head.  DUKE. This is most likely!  ISABELLA. O, that it were as like as it is true!  DUKE. By heaven, fond wretch, thou know’st not what thou speak’st, Or else thou art suborned against his honour In hateful practice. First, his integrity Stands without blemish; next, it imports no reason That with such vehemency he should pursue Faults proper to himself. If he had so offended, He would have weighed thy brother by himself, And not have cut him off. Someone hath set you on. Confess the truth, and say by whose advice Thou cam’st here to complain.  ISABELLA. And is this all? Then, O you blessed ministers above, Keep me in patience, and with ripened time Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up In countenance! Heaven shield your Grace from woe, As I, thus wronged, hence unbelieved go.  DUKE. I know you’d fain be gone. An officer! To prison with her! Shall we thus permit A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall On him so near us? This needs must be a practice. Who knew of your intent and coming hither?  ISABELLA. One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.  [_Exeunt Officer with Isabella._]  DUKE. A ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?  LUCIO. My lord, I know him. ’Tis a meddling friar. I do not like the man. Had he been lay, my lord, For certain words he spake against your Grace In your retirement, I had swinged him soundly.  DUKE. Words against me? This’s a good friar, belike. And to set on this wretched woman here Against our substitute! Let this friar be found.  LUCIO. But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar, I saw them at the prison. A saucy friar, A very scurvy fellow.  FRIAR PETER. Blessed be your royal Grace! I have stood by, my lord, and I have heard Your royal ear abused. First hath this woman Most wrongfully accused your substitute, Who is as free from touch or soil with her As she from one ungot.  DUKE. We did believe no less. Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?  FRIAR PETER. I know him for a man divine and holy, Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler, As he’s reported by this gentleman; And, on my trust, a man that never yet Did, as he vouches, misreport your Grace.  LUCIO. My lord, most villainously; believe it.  FRIAR PETER. Well, he in time may come to clear himself; But at this instant he is sick, my lord, Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request, Being come to knowledge that there was complaint Intended ’gainst Lord Angelo, came I hither To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know Is true and false; and what he with his oath And all probation will make up full clear Whensoever he’s convented. First, for this woman, To justify this worthy nobleman, So vulgarly and personally accused, Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes, Till she herself confess it.  DUKE. Good friar, let’s hear it. Do you not smile at this, Lord Angelo? O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools! Give us some seats.—Come, cousin Angelo, In this I’ll be impartial. Be you judge Of your own cause.  Enter Mariana, veiled.  Is this the witness, friar? First let her show her face, and after speak.  MARIANA. Pardon, my lord; I will not show my face Until my husband bid me.  DUKE. What, are you married?  MARIANA. No, my lord.  DUKE. Are you a maid?  MARIANA. No, my lord.  DUKE. A widow, then?  MARIANA. Neither, my lord.  DUKE. Why, you are nothing then, neither maid, widow, nor wife?  LUCIO. My lord, she may be a punk; for many of them are neither maid, widow, nor wife.  DUKE. Silence that fellow. I would he had some cause to prattle for himself.  LUCIO. Well, my lord.  MARIANA. My lord, I do confess I ne’er was married, And I confess besides, I am no maid. I have known my husband; yet my husband Knows not that ever he knew me.  LUCIO. He was drunk, then, my lord; it can be no better.  DUKE. For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too.  LUCIO. Well, my lord.  DUKE. This is no witness for Lord Angelo.  MARIANA. Now I come to’t, my lord. She that accuses him of fornication In self-same manner doth accuse my husband, And charges him, my lord, with such a time When I’ll depose I had him in mine arms With all th’ effect of love.  ANGELO. Charges she more than me?  MARIANA. Not that I know.  DUKE. No? You say your husband.  MARIANA. Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo, Who thinks he knows that he ne’er knew my body, But knows, he thinks, that he knows Isabel’s.  ANGELO. This is a strange abuse. Let’s see thy face.  MARIANA. My husband bids me; now I will unmask. [_Unveiling_.] This is that face, thou cruel Angelo, Which once thou swor’st was worth the looking on. This is the hand which, with a vowed contract, Was fast belocked in thine. This is the body That took away the match from Isabel And did supply thee at thy garden-house In her imagined person.  DUKE. Know you this woman?  LUCIO. Carnally, she says.  DUKE. Sirrah, no more.  LUCIO. Enough, my lord.  ANGELO. My lord, I must confess I know this woman; And five years since there was some speech of marriage Betwixt myself and her; which was broke off, Partly for that her promised proportions Came short of composition; but in chief For that her reputation was disvalued In levity. Since which time of five years I never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her, Upon my faith and honour.  MARIANA. Noble Prince, As there comes light from heaven and words from breath, As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue, I am affianced this man’s wife as strongly As words could make up vows. And, my good lord, But Tuesday night last gone, in’s garden-house, He knew me as a wife. As this is true, Let me in safety raise me from my knees, Or else for ever be confixed here, A marble monument!  ANGELO. I did but smile till now. Now, good my lord, give me the scope of justice. My patience here is touched. I do perceive These poor informal women are no more But instruments of some more mightier member That sets them on. Let me have way, my lord, To find this practice out.  DUKE. Ay, with my heart; And punish them to your height of pleasure. Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman, Compact with her that’s gone, think’st thou thy oaths, Though they would swear down each particular saint, Were testimonies against his worth and credit, That’s sealed in approbation? You, Lord Escalus, Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains To find out this abuse, whence ’tis derived. There is another friar that set them on; Let him be sent for.  FRIAR PETER. Would he were here, my lord; for he indeed Hath set the women on to this complaint. Your Provost knows the place where he abides, And he may fetch him.  DUKE. Go, do it instantly.  [_Exit Provost._]  And you, my noble and well-warranted cousin, Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth, Do with your injuries as seems you best In any chastisement. I for a while Will leave you; but stir not you till you have Well determined upon these slanderers.  ESCALUS. My lord, we’ll do it throughly.  [_Exit Duke._]  Signior Lucio, did not you say you knew that Friar Lodowick to be a dishonest person?  LUCIO. _Cucullus non facit monachum_, honest in nothing but in his clothes, and one that hath spoke most villainous speeches of the Duke.  ESCALUS. We shall entreat you to abide here till he come, and enforce them against him. We shall find this friar a notable fellow.  LUCIO. As any in Vienna, on my word.  ESCALUS. Call that same Isabel here once again. I would speak with her.  [_Exit an Attendant._]  Pray you, my lord, give me leave to question; you shall see how I’ll handle her.  LUCIO. Not better than he, by her own report.  ESCALUS. Say you?  LUCIO. Marry, sir, I think, if you handled her privately, she would sooner confess; perchance, publicly, she’ll be ashamed.  Enter at several doors Duke as a friar, Provost and Isabella with Officers.  ESCALUS. I will go darkly to work with her.  LUCIO. That’s the way; for women are light at midnight.  ESCALUS. [_To Isabella_.] Come on, mistress, here’s a gentlewoman denies all that you have said.  LUCIO. My lord, here comes the rascal I spoke of, here with the Provost.  ESCALUS. In very good time. Speak not you to him till we call upon you.  LUCIO. Mum.  ESCALUS. Come, sir, did you set these women on to slander Lord Angelo? They have confessed you did.  DUKE. ’Tis false.  ESCALUS. How! Know you where you are?  DUKE. Respect to your great place; and let the devil Be sometime honoured for his burning throne. Where is the Duke? ’Tis he should hear me speak.  ESCALUS. The Duke’s in us; and we will hear you speak. Look you speak justly.  DUKE. Boldly, at least. But, O, poor souls, Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox, Good night to your redress! Is the Duke gone? Then is your cause gone too. The Duke’s unjust Thus to retort your manifest appeal, And put your trial in the villain’s mouth Which here you come to accuse.  LUCIO. This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of.  ESCALUS. Why, thou unreverend and unhallowed friar, Is’t not enough thou hast suborned these women To accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth, And in the witness of his proper ear, To call him villain? And then to glance from him To th’ Duke himself, to tax him with injustice? Take him hence! To th’ rack with him! We’ll touse you Joint by joint, but we will know his purpose. What! Unjust?  DUKE. Be not so hot. The Duke Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he Dare rack his own. His subject am I not, Nor here provincial. My business in this state Made me a looker-on here in Vienna, Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble Till it o’errun the stew. Laws for all faults, But faults so countenanced that the strong statutes Stand like the forfeits in a barber’s shop, As much in mock as mark.  ESCALUS. Slander to the state! Away with him to prison!  ANGELO. What can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio? Is this the man that you did tell us of?  LUCIO. ’Tis he, my lord. Come hither, goodman Baldpate. Do you know me?  DUKE. I remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice. I met you at the prison, in the absence of the Duke.  LUCIO. O did you so? And do you remember what you said of the Duke?  DUKE. Most notedly, sir.  LUCIO. Do you so, sir? And was the Duke a fleshmonger, a fool, and a coward, as you then reported him to be?  DUKE. You must, sir, change persons with me ere you make that my report. You indeed spoke so of him, and much more, much worse.  LUCIO. O thou damnable fellow! Did not I pluck thee by the nose for thy speeches?  DUKE. I protest I love the Duke as I love myself.  ANGELO. Hark how the villain would close now, after his treasonable abuses!  ESCALUS. Such a fellow is not to be talked withal. Away with him to prison! Where is the provost? Away with him to prison! Lay bolts enough upon him. Let him speak no more. Away with those giglets too, and with the other confederate companion!  [_The Provost lays hands on the Duke._]  DUKE. Stay, sir, stay a while.  ANGELO. What, resists he? Help him, Lucio.  LUCIO. Come, sir, come, sir, come, sir. Foh, sir! Why, you bald-pated lying rascal! You must be hooded, must you? Show your knave’s visage, with a pox to you! Show your sheep-biting face, and be hanged an hour! Will’t not off?  [_Pulls off the friar’s hood and discovers the Duke._]  DUKE. Thou art the first knave that e’er mad’st a duke. First, Provost, let me bail these gentle three. [_To Lucio_.] Sneak not away, sir, for the friar and you Must have a word anon.—Lay hold on him.  LUCIO. This may prove worse than hanging.  DUKE. [_To Escalus_.] What you have spoke I pardon. Sit you down. We’ll borrow place of him. [_To Angelo_.] Sir, by your leave. Hast thou or word, or wit, or impudence, That yet can do thee office? If thou hast, Rely upon it till my tale be heard, And hold no longer out.  ANGELO. O my dread lord, I should be guiltier than my guiltiness To think I can be undiscernible, When I perceive your Grace, like power divine, Hath looked upon my passes. Then, good Prince, No longer session hold upon my shame, But let my trial be mine own confession. Immediate sentence then, and sequent death Is all the grace I beg.  DUKE. Come hither, Mariana. Say, wast thou e’er contracted to this woman?  ANGELO. I was, my lord.  DUKE. Go, take her hence and marry her instantly. Do you the office, friar; which consummate, Return him here again.—Go with him, Provost.  [_Exeunt Angelo, Mariana, Friar Peter and Provost._]  ESCALUS. My lord, I am more amazed at his dishonour Than at the strangeness of it.  DUKE. Come hither, Isabel. Your friar is now your prince. As I was then Advertising and holy to your business, Not changing heart with habit, I am still Attorneyed at your service.  ISABELLA. O, give me pardon, That I, your vassal, have employed and pained Your unknown sovereignty.  DUKE. You are pardoned, Isabel. And now, dear maid, be you as free to us. Your brother’s death, I know, sits at your heart, And you may marvel why I obscured myself, Labouring to save his life, and would not rather Make rash remonstrance of my hidden power Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid, It was the swift celerity of his death, Which I did think with slower foot came on, That brained my purpose. But peace be with him. That life is better life, past fearing death, Than that which lives to fear. Make it your comfort, So happy is your brother.  ISABELLA. I do, my lord.  Enter Angelo, Mariana, Friar Peter and Provost.  DUKE. For this new-married man approaching here, Whose salt imagination yet hath wronged Your well-defended honour, you must pardon For Mariana’s sake. But as he adjudged your brother, Being criminal in double violation Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach Thereon dependent, for your brother’s life, The very mercy of the law cries out Most audible, even from his proper tongue, “An Angelo for Claudio, death for death.” Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure; Like doth quit like, and measure still for measure. Then, Angelo, thy fault’s thus manifested, Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage. We do condemn thee to the very block Where Claudio stooped to death, and with like haste. Away with him.  MARIANA. O my most gracious lord, I hope you will not mock me with a husband.  DUKE. It is your husband mocked you with a husband. Consenting to the safeguard of your honour, I thought your marriage fit. Else imputation, For that he knew you, might reproach your life, And choke your good to come. For his possessions, Although by confiscation they are ours, We do instate and widow you with all To buy you a better husband.  MARIANA. O my dear lord, I crave no other, nor no better man.  DUKE. Never crave him; we are definitive.  MARIANA. [_Kneeling_.] Gentle my liege—  DUKE. You do but lose your labour. Away with him to death. [_To Lucio_.] Now, sir, to you.  MARIANA. O my good lord.—Sweet Isabel, take my part; Lend me your knees, and all my life to come I’ll lend you all my life to do you service.  DUKE. Against all sense you do importune her. Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact, Her brother’s ghost his paved bed would break, And take her hence in horror.  MARIANA. Isabel, Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me; Hold up your hands, say nothing. I’ll speak all. They say best men are moulded out of faults, And, for the most, become much more the better For being a little bad. So may my husband. O Isabel, will you not lend a knee?  DUKE. He dies for Claudio’s death.  ISABELLA. [_Kneeling_.] Most bounteous sir, Look, if it please you, on this man condemned As if my brother lived. I partly think A due sincerity governed his deeds Till he did look on me. Since it is so, Let him not die. My brother had but justice, In that he did the thing for which he died. For Angelo, His act did not o’ertake his bad intent, And must be buried but as an intent That perished by the way. Thoughts are no subjects; Intents but merely thoughts.  MARIANA. Merely, my lord.  DUKE. Your suit’s unprofitable. Stand up, I say. I have bethought me of another fault. Provost, how came it Claudio was beheaded At an unusual hour?  PROVOST. It was commanded so.  DUKE. Had you a special warrant for the deed?  PROVOST. No, my good lord, it was by private message.  DUKE. For which I do discharge you of your office. Give up your keys.  PROVOST. Pardon me, noble lord. I thought it was a fault, but knew it not; Yet did repent me after more advice. For testimony whereof, one in the prison That should by private order else have died, I have reserved alive.  DUKE. What’s he?  PROVOST. His name is Barnardine.  DUKE. I would thou hadst done so by Claudio. Go fetch him hither, let me look upon him.  [_Exit Provost._]  ESCALUS. I am sorry one so learned and so wise As you, Lord Angelo, have still appeared, Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood And lack of tempered judgement afterward.  ANGELO. I am sorry that such sorrow I procure, And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart That I crave death more willingly than mercy; ’Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it.  Enter Provost with Barnardine, Claudio (muffled) and Juliet.  DUKE. Which is that Barnardine?  PROVOST. This, my lord.  DUKE. There was a friar told me of this man. Sirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul That apprehends no further than this world, And squar’st thy life according. Thou’rt condemned; But, for those earthly faults, I quit them all, And pray thee take this mercy to provide For better times to come. Friar, advise him; I leave him to your hand.—What muffled fellow’s that?  PROVOST. This is another prisoner that I saved, Who should have died when Claudio lost his head; As like almost to Claudio as himself.  [_Unmuffles Claudio._]  DUKE. [_To Isabella_.] If he be like your brother, for his sake Is he pardoned; and for your lovely sake, Give me your hand and say you will be mine. He is my brother too. But fitter time for that. By this Lord Angelo perceives he’s safe; Methinks I see a quick’ning in his eye. Well, Angelo, your evil quits you well. Look that you love your wife, her worth worth yours. I find an apt remission in myself. And yet here’s one in place I cannot pardon. [_To Lucio_.] You, sirrah, that knew me for a fool, a coward, One all of luxury, an ass, a madman. Wherein have I so deserved of you That you extol me thus?  LUCIO. Faith, my lord, I spoke it but according to the trick. If you will hang me for it, you may, but I had rather it would please you I might be whipped.  DUKE. Whipped first, sir, and hanged after. Proclaim it, Provost, round about the city, If any woman wronged by this lewd fellow, As I have heard him swear himself there’s one Whom he begot with child—let her appear, And he shall marry her. The nuptial finished, Let him be whipped and hanged.  LUCIO. I beseech your Highness, do not marry me to a whore. Your highness said even now I made you a duke; good my lord, do not recompense me in making me a cuckold.  DUKE. Upon mine honour, thou shalt marry her. Thy slanders I forgive, and therewithal Remit thy other forfeits.—Take him to prison, And see our pleasure herein executed.  LUCIO. Marrying a punk, my lord, is pressing to death, whipping, and hanging.  DUKE. Slandering a prince deserves it.  [_Exeunt Officers with Lucio._]  She, Claudio, that you wronged, look you restore. Joy to you, Mariana! Love her, Angelo. I have confessed her, and I know her virtue. Thanks, good friend Escalus, for thy much goodness; There’s more behind that is more gratulate. Thanks, Provost, for thy care and secrecy; We shall employ thee in a worthier place. Forgive him, Angelo, that brought you home The head of Ragozine for Claudio’s. Th’ offence pardons itself. Dear Isabel, I have a motion much imports your good; Whereto if you’ll a willing ear incline, What’s mine is yours, and what is yours is mine. So, bring us to our palace, where we’ll show What’s yet behind that’s meet you all should know.  [_Exeunt._]

 Dramatis Personæ  THE DUKE OF VENICE THE PRINCE OF MOROCCO, suitor to Portia THE PRINCE OF ARRAGON, suitor to Portia ANTONIO, a merchant of Venice BASSANIO, his friend, suitor to Portia GRATIANO, friend to Antonio and Bassanio SOLANIO, friend to Antonio and Bassanio SALARINO, friend to Antonio and Bassanio LORENZO, in love with Jessica SHYLOCK, a rich Jew TUBAL, a Jew, his friend LAUNCELET GOBBO, a clown, servant to Shylock OLD GOBBO, father to Launcelet LEONARDO, servant to Bassanio BALTHAZAR, servant to Portia STEPHANO, servant to Portia SALERIO, a messenger from Venice  PORTIA, a rich heiress NERISSA, her waiting-woman JESSICA, daughter to Shylock  Magnificoes of Venice, Officers of the Court of Justice, a Gaoler, Servants and other Attendants  SCENE: Partly at Venice, and partly at Belmont, the seat of Portia on the Continent
ACT I  SCENE I. Venice. A street.   Enter Antonio, Salarino and Solanio.  ANTONIO. In sooth I know not why I am so sad, It wearies me, you say it wearies you; But how I caught it, found it, or came by it, What stuff ’tis made of, whereof it is born, I am to learn. And such a want-wit sadness makes of me, That I have much ado to know myself.  SALARINO. Your mind is tossing on the ocean, There where your argosies, with portly sail Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood, Or as it were the pageants of the sea, Do overpeer the petty traffickers That curtsy to them, do them reverence, As they fly by them with their woven wings.  SOLANIO. Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth, The better part of my affections would Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still Plucking the grass to know where sits the wind, Peering in maps for ports, and piers and roads; And every object that might make me fear Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt Would make me sad.  SALARINO. My wind cooling my broth Would blow me to an ague when I thought What harm a wind too great might do at sea. I should not see the sandy hour-glass run But I should think of shallows and of flats, And see my wealthy Andrew dock’d in sand, Vailing her high top lower than her ribs To kiss her burial. Should I go to church And see the holy edifice of stone And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks, Which, touching but my gentle vessel’s side, Would scatter all her spices on the stream, Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks, And, in a word, but even now worth this, And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought To think on this, and shall I lack the thought That such a thing bechanc’d would make me sad? But tell not me, I know Antonio Is sad to think upon his merchandise.  ANTONIO. Believe me, no. I thank my fortune for it, My ventures are not in one bottom trusted, Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate Upon the fortune of this present year. Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.  SALARINO. Why then you are in love.  ANTONIO. Fie, fie!  SALARINO. Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad Because you are not merry; and ’twere as easy For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus, Nature hath fram’d strange fellows in her time: Some that will evermore peep through their eyes, And laugh like parrots at a bagpiper. And other of such vinegar aspect That they’ll not show their teeth in way of smile Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.   Enter Bassanio, Lorenzo and Gratiano.  SOLANIO. Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman, Gratiano, and Lorenzo. Fare ye well. We leave you now with better company.  SALARINO. I would have stay’d till I had made you merry, If worthier friends had not prevented me.  ANTONIO. Your worth is very dear in my regard. I take it your own business calls on you, And you embrace th’ occasion to depart.  SALARINO. Good morrow, my good lords.  BASSANIO. Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? Say, when? You grow exceeding strange. Must it be so?  SALARINO. We’ll make our leisures to attend on yours.   [_Exeunt Salarino and Solanio._]  LORENZO. My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio, We two will leave you, but at dinner-time I pray you have in mind where we must meet.  BASSANIO. I will not fail you.  GRATIANO. You look not well, Signior Antonio, You have too much respect upon the world. They lose it that do buy it with much care. Believe me, you are marvellously chang’d.  ANTONIO. I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano, A stage, where every man must play a part, And mine a sad one.  GRATIANO. Let me play the fool, With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come, And let my liver rather heat with wine Than my heart cool with mortifying groans. Why should a man whose blood is warm within Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster? Sleep when he wakes? And creep into the jaundice By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio, (I love thee, and ’tis my love that speaks): There are a sort of men whose visages Do cream and mantle like a standing pond, And do a wilful stillness entertain, With purpose to be dress’d in an opinion Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit, As who should say, “I am Sir Oracle, And when I ope my lips, let no dog bark.” O my Antonio, I do know of these That therefore only are reputed wise For saying nothing; when, I am very sure, If they should speak, would almost damn those ears Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools. I’ll tell thee more of this another time. But fish not with this melancholy bait For this fool gudgeon, this opinion. Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well a while. I’ll end my exhortation after dinner.  LORENZO. Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time. I must be one of these same dumb wise men, For Gratiano never lets me speak.  GRATIANO. Well, keep me company but two years moe, Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.  ANTONIO. Fare you well. I’ll grow a talker for this gear.  GRATIANO. Thanks, i’ faith, for silence is only commendable In a neat’s tongue dried, and a maid not vendible.   [_Exeunt Gratiano and Lorenzo._]  ANTONIO. Is that anything now?  BASSANIO. Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you have them they are not worth the search.  ANTONIO. Well, tell me now what lady is the same To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage, That you today promis’d to tell me of?  BASSANIO. ’Tis not unknown to you, Antonio, How much I have disabled mine estate By something showing a more swelling port Than my faint means would grant continuance. Nor do I now make moan to be abridg’d From such a noble rate, but my chief care Is to come fairly off from the great debts Wherein my time, something too prodigal, Hath left me gag’d. To you, Antonio, I owe the most in money and in love, And from your love I have a warranty To unburden all my plots and purposes How to get clear of all the debts I owe.  ANTONIO. I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it; And if it stand, as you yourself still do, Within the eye of honour, be assur’d My purse, my person, my extremest means Lie all unlock’d to your occasions.  BASSANIO. In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft, I shot his fellow of the self-same flight The self-same way, with more advised watch To find the other forth; and by adventuring both I oft found both. I urge this childhood proof Because what follows is pure innocence. I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth, That which I owe is lost. But if you please To shoot another arrow that self way Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt, As I will watch the aim, or to find both, Or bring your latter hazard back again, And thankfully rest debtor for the first.  ANTONIO. You know me well, and herein spend but time To wind about my love with circumstance; And out of doubt you do me now more wrong In making question of my uttermost Than if you had made waste of all I have. Then do but say to me what I should do That in your knowledge may by me be done, And I am prest unto it. Therefore, speak.  BASSANIO. In Belmont is a lady richly left, And she is fair, and, fairer than that word, Of wondrous virtues. Sometimes from her eyes I did receive fair speechless messages: Her name is Portia, nothing undervalu’d To Cato’s daughter, Brutus’ Portia. Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth, For the four winds blow in from every coast Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks Hang on her temples like a golden fleece, Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos’ strond, And many Jasons come in quest of her. O my Antonio, had I but the means To hold a rival place with one of them, I have a mind presages me such thrift That I should questionless be fortunate.  ANTONIO. Thou know’st that all my fortunes are at sea; Neither have I money nor commodity To raise a present sum, therefore go forth Try what my credit can in Venice do; That shall be rack’d even to the uttermost, To furnish thee to Belmont to fair Portia. Go presently inquire, and so will I, Where money is, and I no question make To have it of my trust or for my sake.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. Belmont. A room in Portia’s house.   Enter Portia with her waiting-woman Nerissa.  PORTIA. By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of this great world.  NERISSA. You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are. And yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing. It is no mean happiness, therefore, to be seated in the mean. Superfluity come sooner by white hairs, but competency lives longer.  PORTIA. Good sentences, and well pronounc’d.  NERISSA. They would be better if well followed.  PORTIA. If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been churches, and poor men’s cottages princes’ palaces. It is a good divine that follows his own instructions; I can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than to be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps o’er a cold decree; such a hare is madness the youth, to skip o’er the meshes of good counsel the cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband. O me, the word “choose”! I may neither choose who I would nor refuse who I dislike, so is the will of a living daughter curb’d by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one, nor refuse none?  NERISSA. Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their death have good inspirations. Therefore the lott’ry that he hath devised in these three chests of gold, silver, and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you, will no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly love. But what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely suitors that are already come?  PORTIA. I pray thee over-name them, and as thou namest them, I will describe them, and according to my description level at my affection.  NERISSA. First, there is the Neapolitan prince.  PORTIA. Ay, that’s a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but talk of his horse, and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his mother play’d false with a smith.  NERISSA. Then is there the County Palatine.  PORTIA. He doth nothing but frown, as who should say “And you will not have me, choose.” He hears merry tales and smiles not. I fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old, being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be married to a death’s-head with a bone in his mouth than to either of these. God defend me from these two!  NERISSA. How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?  PORTIA. God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man. In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker, but he! why, he hath a horse better than the Neapolitan’s, a better bad habit of frowning than the Count Palatine. He is every man in no man. If a throstle sing, he falls straight a-cap’ring. He will fence with his own shadow. If I should marry him, I should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me, I would forgive him, for if he love me to madness, I shall never requite him.  NERISSA. What say you then to Falconbridge, the young baron of England?  PORTIA. You know I say nothing to him, for he understands not me, nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French, nor Italian, and you will come into the court and swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English. He is a proper man’s picture; but alas, who can converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited! I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round hose in France, his bonnet in Germany, and his behaviour everywhere.  NERISSA. What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?  PORTIA. That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman, and swore he would pay him again when he was able. I think the Frenchman became his surety, and seal’d under for another.  NERISSA. How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony’s nephew?  PORTIA. Very vilely in the morning when he is sober, and most vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk: when he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and when he is worst, he is little better than a beast. And the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall make shift to go without him.  NERISSA. If he should offer to choose, and choose the right casket, you should refuse to perform your father’s will, if you should refuse to accept him.  PORTIA. Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee set a deep glass of Rhenish wine on the contrary casket, for if the devil be within and that temptation without, I know he will choose it. I will do anything, Nerissa, ere I will be married to a sponge.  NERISSA. You need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords. They have acquainted me with their determinations, which is indeed to return to their home, and to trouble you with no more suit, unless you may be won by some other sort than your father’s imposition, depending on the caskets.  PORTIA. If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner of my father’s will. I am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable, for there is not one among them but I dote on his very absence. And I pray God grant them a fair departure.  NERISSA. Do you not remember, lady, in your father’s time, a Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither in company of the Marquis of Montferrat?  PORTIA. Yes, yes, it was Bassanio, as I think, so was he call’d.  NERISSA. True, madam. He, of all the men that ever my foolish eyes look’d upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.  PORTIA. I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of thy praise.   Enter a Servingman.  How now! what news?  SERVINGMAN. The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take their leave. And there is a forerunner come from a fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the Prince his master will be here tonight.  PORTIA. If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should be glad of his approach. If he have the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come, Nerissa. Sirrah, go before. Whiles we shut the gate upon one wooer, another knocks at the door.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. Venice. A public place.   Enter Bassanio with Shylock the Jew.  SHYLOCK. Three thousand ducats, well.  BASSANIO. Ay, sir, for three months.  SHYLOCK. For three months, well.  BASSANIO. For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.  SHYLOCK. Antonio shall become bound, well.  BASSANIO. May you stead me? Will you pleasure me? Shall I know your answer?  SHYLOCK. Three thousand ducats for three months, and Antonio bound.  BASSANIO. Your answer to that.  SHYLOCK. Antonio is a good man.  BASSANIO. Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?  SHYLOCK. Ho, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a good man is to have you understand me that he is sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the Indies. I understand, moreover, upon the Rialto, he hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and other ventures he hath squandered abroad. But ships are but boards, sailors but men; there be land-rats and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves—I mean pirates—and then there is the peril of waters, winds, and rocks. The man is, notwithstanding, sufficient. Three thousand ducats. I think I may take his bond.  BASSANIO. Be assured you may.  SHYLOCK. I will be assured I may. And that I may be assured, I will bethink me. May I speak with Antonio?  BASSANIO. If it please you to dine with us.  SHYLOCK. Yes, to smell pork, to eat of the habitation which your prophet, the Nazarite, conjured the devil into. I will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you, walk with you, and so following; but I will not eat with you, drink with you, nor pray with you. What news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here?   Enter Antonio.  BASSANIO. This is Signior Antonio.  SHYLOCK. [_Aside._] How like a fawning publican he looks! I hate him for he is a Christian, But more for that in low simplicity He lends out money gratis, and brings down The rate of usance here with us in Venice. If I can catch him once upon the hip, I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him. He hates our sacred nation, and he rails, Even there where merchants most do congregate, On me, my bargains, and my well-won thrift, Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe If I forgive him!  BASSANIO. Shylock, do you hear?  SHYLOCK. I am debating of my present store, And by the near guess of my memory I cannot instantly raise up the gross Of full three thousand ducats. What of that? Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe, Will furnish me. But soft! how many months Do you desire? [_To Antonio._] Rest you fair, good signior, Your worship was the last man in our mouths.  ANTONIO. Shylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow By taking nor by giving of excess, Yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend, I’ll break a custom. [_To Bassanio._] Is he yet possess’d How much ye would?  SHYLOCK. Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.  ANTONIO. And for three months.  SHYLOCK. I had forgot, three months, you told me so. Well then, your bond. And let me see, but hear you, Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow Upon advantage.  ANTONIO. I do never use it.  SHYLOCK. When Jacob graz’d his uncle Laban’s sheep,— This Jacob from our holy Abram was As his wise mother wrought in his behalf, The third possessor; ay, he was the third.  ANTONIO. And what of him? Did he take interest?  SHYLOCK. No, not take interest, not, as you would say, Directly interest; mark what Jacob did. When Laban and himself were compromis’d That all the eanlings which were streak’d and pied Should fall as Jacob’s hire, the ewes being rank In end of autumn turned to the rams, And when the work of generation was Between these woolly breeders in the act, The skilful shepherd pill’d me certain wands, And in the doing of the deed of kind, He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes, Who then conceiving did in eaning time Fall parti-colour’d lambs, and those were Jacob’s. This was a way to thrive, and he was blest; And thrift is blessing if men steal it not.  ANTONIO. This was a venture, sir, that Jacob serv’d for, A thing not in his power to bring to pass, But sway’d and fashion’d by the hand of heaven. Was this inserted to make interest good? Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?  SHYLOCK. I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast. But note me, signior.  ANTONIO. Mark you this, Bassanio, The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose. An evil soul producing holy witness Is like a villain with a smiling cheek, A goodly apple rotten at the heart. O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!  SHYLOCK. Three thousand ducats, ’tis a good round sum. Three months from twelve, then let me see the rate.  ANTONIO. Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?  SHYLOCK. Signior Antonio, many a time and oft In the Rialto you have rated me About my moneys and my usances. Still have I borne it with a patient shrug, (For suff’rance is the badge of all our tribe.) You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog, And spet upon my Jewish gaberdine, And all for use of that which is mine own. Well then, it now appears you need my help. Go to, then, you come to me, and you say “Shylock, we would have moneys.” You say so: You that did void your rheum upon my beard, And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur Over your threshold, moneys is your suit. What should I say to you? Should I not say “Hath a dog money? Is it possible A cur can lend three thousand ducats?” Or Shall I bend low and, in a bondman’s key, With bated breath and whisp’ring humbleness, Say this: “Fair sir, you spet on me on Wednesday last; You spurn’d me such a day; another time You call’d me dog; and for these courtesies I’ll lend you thus much moneys”?  ANTONIO. I am as like to call thee so again, To spet on thee again, to spurn thee too. If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not As to thy friends, for when did friendship take A breed for barren metal of his friend? But lend it rather to thine enemy, Who if he break, thou mayst with better face Exact the penalty.  SHYLOCK. Why, look you how you storm! I would be friends with you, and have your love, Forget the shames that you have stain’d me with, Supply your present wants, and take no doit Of usance for my moneys, and you’ll not hear me, This is kind I offer.  BASSANIO. This were kindness.  SHYLOCK. This kindness will I show. Go with me to a notary, seal me there Your single bond; and in a merry sport, If you repay me not on such a day, In such a place, such sum or sums as are Express’d in the condition, let the forfeit Be nominated for an equal pound Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken In what part of your body pleaseth me.  ANTONIO. Content, in faith, I’ll seal to such a bond, And say there is much kindness in the Jew.  BASSANIO. You shall not seal to such a bond for me, I’ll rather dwell in my necessity.  ANTONIO. Why, fear not, man, I will not forfeit it, Within these two months, that’s a month before This bond expires, I do expect return Of thrice three times the value of this bond.  SHYLOCK. O father Abram, what these Christians are, Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect The thoughts of others. Pray you, tell me this, If he should break his day, what should I gain By the exaction of the forfeiture? A pound of man’s flesh, taken from a man, Is not so estimable, profitable neither, As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. I say, To buy his favour, I extend this friendship. If he will take it, so. If not, adieu, And for my love I pray you wrong me not.  ANTONIO. Yes, Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.  SHYLOCK. Then meet me forthwith at the notary’s, Give him direction for this merry bond, And I will go and purse the ducats straight, See to my house left in the fearful guard Of an unthrifty knave, and presently I’ll be with you.  ANTONIO. Hie thee, gentle Jew.   [_Exit Shylock._]  This Hebrew will turn Christian; he grows kind.  BASSANIO. I like not fair terms and a villain’s mind.  ANTONIO. Come on; in this there can be no dismay; My ships come home a month before the day.   [_Exeunt._]
ACT II  SCENE I. Belmont. A room in Portia’s house.   Flourish of cornets. Enter the Prince of Morocco, a tawny Moor all in  white, and three or four followers accordingly, with Portia, Nerissa  and their train.  PRINCE OF MOROCCO. Mislike me not for my complexion, The shadowed livery of the burnish’d sun, To whom I am a neighbour, and near bred. Bring me the fairest creature northward born, Where Phœbus’ fire scarce thaws the icicles, And let us make incision for your love To prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine. I tell thee, lady, this aspect of mine Hath fear’d the valiant; by my love I swear The best-regarded virgins of our clime Have lov’d it too. I would not change this hue, Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.  PORTIA. In terms of choice I am not solely led By nice direction of a maiden’s eyes; Besides, the lott’ry of my destiny Bars me the right of voluntary choosing. But if my father had not scanted me And hedg’d me by his wit to yield myself His wife who wins me by that means I told you, Yourself, renowned Prince, then stood as fair As any comer I have look’d on yet For my affection.  PRINCE OF MOROCCO. Even for that I thank you. Therefore I pray you lead me to the caskets To try my fortune. By this scimitar That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince, That won three fields of Sultan Solyman, I would o’erstare the sternest eyes that look, Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth, Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear, Yea, mock the lion when he roars for prey, To win thee, lady. But, alas the while! If Hercules and Lichas play at dice Which is the better man, the greater throw May turn by fortune from the weaker hand: So is Alcides beaten by his rage, And so may I, blind Fortune leading me, Miss that which one unworthier may attain, And die with grieving.  PORTIA. You must take your chance, And either not attempt to choose at all, Or swear before you choose, if you choose wrong Never to speak to lady afterward In way of marriage. Therefore be advis’d.  PRINCE OF MOROCCO. Nor will not. Come, bring me unto my chance.  PORTIA. First, forward to the temple. After dinner Your hazard shall be made.  PRINCE OF MOROCCO. Good fortune then, To make me blest or cursed’st among men!   [_Cornets. Exeunt._]  SCENE II. Venice. A street.   Enter Launcelet Gobbo, the clown, alone.  LAUNCELET. Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this Jew my master. The fiend is at mine elbow and tempts me, saying to me “Gobbo, Launcelet Gobbo, good Launcelet” or “good Gobbo,” or “good Launcelet Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away.” My conscience says “No; take heed, honest Launcelet, take heed, honest Gobbo” or, as aforesaid, “honest Launcelet Gobbo, do not run, scorn running with thy heels.” Well, the most courageous fiend bids me pack. “Fia!” says the fiend, “away!” says the fiend. “For the heavens, rouse up a brave mind,” says the fiend, “and run.” Well, my conscience, hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wisely to me “My honest friend Launcelet, being an honest man’s son”—or rather an honest woman’s son, for indeed my father did something smack, something grow to, he had a kind of taste;—well, my conscience says “Launcelet, budge not.” “Budge,” says the fiend. “Budge not,” says my conscience. “Conscience,” say I, “you counsel well.” “Fiend,” say I, “you counsel well.” To be ruled by my conscience, I should stay with the Jew my master, who, (God bless the mark) is a kind of devil; and, to run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the fiend, who (saving your reverence) is the devil himself. Certainly the Jew is the very devil incarnation, and, in my conscience, my conscience is but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counsel me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more friendly counsel. I will run, fiend, my heels are at your commandment, I will run.   Enter Old Gobbo with a basket.  GOBBO. Master young man, you, I pray you; which is the way to Master Jew’s?  LAUNCELET. [_Aside._] O heavens, this is my true-begotten father, who being more than sand-blind, high-gravel blind, knows me not. I will try confusions with him.  GOBBO. Master young gentleman, I pray you, which is the way to Master Jew’s?  LAUNCELET. Turn up on your right hand at the next turning, but at the next turning of all on your left; marry, at the very next turning, turn of no hand, but turn down indirectly to the Jew’s house.  GOBBO. Be God’s sonties, ’twill be a hard way to hit. Can you tell me whether one Launcelet, that dwells with him, dwell with him or no?  LAUNCELET. Talk you of young Master Launcelet? [_Aside._] Mark me now, now will I raise the waters. Talk you of young Master Launcelet?  GOBBO. No master, sir, but a poor man’s son, his father, though I say’t, is an honest exceeding poor man, and, God be thanked, well to live.  LAUNCELET. Well, let his father be what he will, we talk of young Master Launcelet.  GOBBO. Your worship’s friend, and Launcelet, sir.  LAUNCELET. But I pray you, _ergo_, old man, _ergo_, I beseech you, talk you of young Master Launcelet?  GOBBO. Of Launcelet, an’t please your mastership.  LAUNCELET. _Ergo_, Master Launcelet. Talk not of Master Launcelet, father, for the young gentleman, according to Fates and Destinies, and such odd sayings, the Sisters Three and such branches of learning, is indeed deceased, or, as you would say in plain terms, gone to heaven.  GOBBO. Marry, God forbid! The boy was the very staff of my age, my very prop.  LAUNCELET. [_Aside._] Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post, a staff or a prop? Do you know me, father?  GOBBO. Alack the day! I know you not, young gentleman, but I pray you tell me, is my boy, God rest his soul, alive or dead?  LAUNCELET. Do you not know me, father?  GOBBO. Alack, sir, I am sand-blind, I know you not.  LAUNCELET. Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of the knowing me: it is a wise father that knows his own child. Well, old man, I will tell you news of your son. Give me your blessing, truth will come to light, murder cannot be hid long, a man’s son may, but in the end truth will out.  GOBBO. Pray you, sir, stand up, I am sure you are not Launcelet my boy.  LAUNCELET. Pray you, let’s have no more fooling about it, but give me your blessing. I am Launcelet, your boy that was, your son that is, your child that shall be.  GOBBO. I cannot think you are my son.  LAUNCELET. I know not what I shall think of that; but I am Launcelet, the Jew’s man, and I am sure Margery your wife is my mother.  GOBBO. Her name is Margery, indeed. I’ll be sworn if thou be Launcelet, thou art mine own flesh and blood. Lord worshipped might he be, what a beard hast thou got! Thou hast got more hair on thy chin than Dobbin my fill-horse has on his tail.  LAUNCELET. It should seem, then, that Dobbin’s tail grows backward. I am sure he had more hair on his tail than I have on my face when I last saw him.  GOBBO. Lord, how art thou changed! How dost thou and thy master agree? I have brought him a present. How ’gree you now?  LAUNCELET. Well, well. But for mine own part, as I have set up my rest to run away, so I will not rest till I have run some ground. My master’s a very Jew. Give him a present! Give him a halter. I am famished in his service. You may tell every finger I have with my ribs. Father, I am glad you are come, give me your present to one Master Bassanio, who indeed gives rare new liveries. If I serve not him, I will run as far as God has any ground. O rare fortune, here comes the man! To him, father; for I am a Jew, if I serve the Jew any longer.   Enter Bassanio with Leonardo and a follower or two.  BASSANIO. You may do so, but let it be so hasted that supper be ready at the farthest by five of the clock. See these letters delivered, put the liveries to making, and desire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging.   [_Exit a Servant._]  LAUNCELET. To him, father.  GOBBO. God bless your worship!  BASSANIO. Gramercy, wouldst thou aught with me?  GOBBO. Here’s my son, sir, a poor boy.  LAUNCELET. Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew’s man, that would, sir, as my father shall specify.  GOBBO. He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve.  LAUNCELET. Indeed the short and the long is, I serve the Jew, and have a desire, as my father shall specify.  GOBBO. His master and he (saving your worship’s reverence) are scarce cater-cousins.  LAUNCELET. To be brief, the very truth is that the Jew, having done me wrong, doth cause me, as my father, being I hope an old man, shall frutify unto you.  GOBBO. I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon your worship, and my suit is—  LAUNCELET. In very brief, the suit is impertinent to myself, as your worship shall know by this honest old man, and though I say it, though old man, yet poor man, my father.  BASSANIO. One speak for both. What would you?  LAUNCELET. Serve you, sir.  GOBBO. That is the very defect of the matter, sir.  BASSANIO. I know thee well; thou hast obtain’d thy suit. Shylock thy master spoke with me this day, And hath preferr’d thee, if it be preferment To leave a rich Jew’s service to become The follower of so poor a gentleman.  LAUNCELET. The old proverb is very well parted between my master Shylock and you, sir: you have “the grace of God”, sir, and he hath “enough”.  BASSANIO. Thou speak’st it well. Go, father, with thy son. Take leave of thy old master, and inquire My lodging out. [_To a Servant._] Give him a livery More guarded than his fellows’; see it done.  LAUNCELET. Father, in. I cannot get a service, no! I have ne’er a tongue in my head! [_Looking on his palm._] Well, if any man in Italy have a fairer table which doth offer to swear upon a book, I shall have good fortune; go to, here’s a simple line of life. Here’s a small trifle of wives, alas, fifteen wives is nothing; eleven widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in for one man. And then to scape drowning thrice, and to be in peril of my life with the edge of a feather-bed; here are simple ’scapes. Well, if Fortune be a woman, she’s a good wench for this gear. Father, come; I’ll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling.   [_Exeunt Launcelet and Old Gobbo._]  BASSANIO. I pray thee, good Leonardo, think on this. These things being bought and orderly bestow’d, Return in haste, for I do feast tonight My best esteem’d acquaintance; hie thee, go.  LEONARDO. My best endeavours shall be done herein.   Enter Gratiano.  GRATIANO. Where’s your master?  LEONARDO. Yonder, sir, he walks.   [_Exit._]  GRATIANO. Signior Bassanio!  BASSANIO. Gratiano!  GRATIANO. I have suit to you.  BASSANIO. You have obtain’d it.  GRATIANO. You must not deny me, I must go with you to Belmont.  BASSANIO. Why, then you must. But hear thee, Gratiano, Thou art too wild, too rude, and bold of voice, Parts that become thee happily enough, And in such eyes as ours appear not faults; But where thou art not known, why there they show Something too liberal. Pray thee, take pain To allay with some cold drops of modesty Thy skipping spirit, lest through thy wild behaviour I be misconst’red in the place I go to, And lose my hopes.  GRATIANO. Signior Bassanio, hear me. If I do not put on a sober habit, Talk with respect, and swear but now and then, Wear prayer-books in my pocket, look demurely, Nay more, while grace is saying, hood mine eyes Thus with my hat, and sigh, and say “amen”; Use all the observance of civility Like one well studied in a sad ostent To please his grandam, never trust me more.  BASSANIO. Well, we shall see your bearing.  GRATIANO. Nay, but I bar tonight, you shall not gauge me By what we do tonight.  BASSANIO. No, that were pity. I would entreat you rather to put on Your boldest suit of mirth, for we have friends That purpose merriment. But fare you well, I have some business.  GRATIANO. And I must to Lorenzo and the rest, But we will visit you at supper-time.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. The same. A room in Shylock’s house.   Enter Jessica and Launcelet.  JESSICA. I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so. Our house is hell, and thou, a merry devil, Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness. But fare thee well, there is a ducat for thee, And, Launcelet, soon at supper shalt thou see Lorenzo, who is thy new master’s guest. Give him this letter, do it secretly. And so farewell. I would not have my father See me in talk with thee.  LAUNCELET. Adieu! tears exhibit my tongue, most beautiful pagan, most sweet Jew! If a Christian do not play the knave and get thee, I am much deceived. But, adieu! These foolish drops do something drown my manly spirit. Adieu!  JESSICA. Farewell, good Launcelet.   [_Exit Launcelet._]  Alack, what heinous sin is it in me To be ashamed to be my father’s child! But though I am a daughter to his blood, I am not to his manners. O Lorenzo, If thou keep promise, I shall end this strife, Become a Christian and thy loving wife.   [_Exit._]  SCENE IV. The same. A street.   Enter Gratiano, Lorenzo, Salarino and Solanio.  LORENZO. Nay, we will slink away in supper-time, Disguise us at my lodging, and return All in an hour.  GRATIANO. We have not made good preparation.  SALARINO. We have not spoke us yet of torch-bearers.  SOLANIO. ’Tis vile, unless it may be quaintly order’d, And better in my mind not undertook.  LORENZO. ’Tis now but four o’clock, we have two hours To furnish us.   Enter Launcelet with a letter.  Friend Launcelet, what’s the news?  LAUNCELET. And it shall please you to break up this, it shall seem to signify.  LORENZO. I know the hand, in faith ’tis a fair hand, And whiter than the paper it writ on Is the fair hand that writ.  GRATIANO. Love news, in faith.  LAUNCELET. By your leave, sir.  LORENZO. Whither goest thou?  LAUNCELET. Marry, sir, to bid my old master the Jew to sup tonight with my new master the Christian.  LORENZO. Hold here, take this. Tell gentle Jessica I will not fail her, speak it privately. Go, gentlemen,   [_Exit Launcelet._]  Will you prepare you for this masque tonight? I am provided of a torch-bearer.  SALARINO. Ay, marry, I’ll be gone about it straight.  SOLANIO. And so will I.  LORENZO. Meet me and Gratiano At Gratiano’s lodging some hour hence.  SALARINO. ’Tis good we do so.   [_Exeunt Salarino and Solanio._]  GRATIANO. Was not that letter from fair Jessica?  LORENZO. I must needs tell thee all. She hath directed How I shall take her from her father’s house, What gold and jewels she is furnish’d with, What page’s suit she hath in readiness. If e’er the Jew her father come to heaven, It will be for his gentle daughter’s sake; And never dare misfortune cross her foot, Unless she do it under this excuse, That she is issue to a faithless Jew. Come, go with me, peruse this as thou goest; Fair Jessica shall be my torch-bearer.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE V. The same. Before Shylock’s house.   Enter Shylock the Jew and Launcelet his man that was the clown.  SHYLOCK. Well, thou shalt see, thy eyes shall be thy judge, The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio.— What, Jessica!—Thou shalt not gormandize As thou hast done with me;—What, Jessica!— And sleep, and snore, and rend apparel out. Why, Jessica, I say!  LAUNCELET. Why, Jessica!  SHYLOCK. Who bids thee call? I do not bid thee call.  LAUNCELET. Your worship was wont to tell me I could do nothing without bidding.   Enter Jessica.  JESSICA. Call you? What is your will?  SHYLOCK. I am bid forth to supper, Jessica. There are my keys. But wherefore should I go? I am not bid for love, they flatter me. But yet I’ll go in hate, to feed upon The prodigal Christian. Jessica, my girl, Look to my house. I am right loath to go; There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest, For I did dream of money-bags tonight.  LAUNCELET. I beseech you, sir, go. My young master doth expect your reproach.  SHYLOCK. So do I his.  LAUNCELET. And they have conspired together. I will not say you shall see a masque, but if you do, then it was not for nothing that my nose fell a-bleeding on Black Monday last at six o’clock i’ th’ morning, falling out that year on Ash-Wednesday was four year in th’ afternoon.  SHYLOCK. What, are there masques? Hear you me, Jessica, Lock up my doors, and when you hear the drum And the vile squealing of the wry-neck’d fife, Clamber not you up to the casements then, Nor thrust your head into the public street To gaze on Christian fools with varnish’d faces, But stop my house’s ears, I mean my casements. Let not the sound of shallow fopp’ry enter My sober house. By Jacob’s staff I swear I have no mind of feasting forth tonight. But I will go. Go you before me, sirrah. Say I will come.  LAUNCELET. I will go before, sir. Mistress, look out at window for all this.     There will come a Christian by     Will be worth a Jewess’ eye.   [_Exit Launcelet._]  SHYLOCK. What says that fool of Hagar’s offspring, ha?  JESSICA. His words were “Farewell, mistress,” nothing else.  SHYLOCK. The patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder, Snail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by day More than the wild-cat. Drones hive not with me, Therefore I part with him, and part with him To one that I would have him help to waste His borrowed purse. Well, Jessica, go in. Perhaps I will return immediately: Do as I bid you, shut doors after you, “Fast bind, fast find.” A proverb never stale in thrifty mind.   [_Exit._]  JESSICA. Farewell, and if my fortune be not crost, I have a father, you a daughter, lost.   [_Exit._]  SCENE VI. The same.   Enter the masquers, Gratiano and Salarino.  GRATIANO. This is the penthouse under which Lorenzo Desired us to make stand.  SALARINO. His hour is almost past.  GRATIANO. And it is marvel he out-dwells his hour, For lovers ever run before the clock.  SALARINO. O ten times faster Venus’ pigeons fly To seal love’s bonds new-made than they are wont To keep obliged faith unforfeited!  GRATIANO. That ever holds: who riseth from a feast With that keen appetite that he sits down? Where is the horse that doth untread again His tedious measures with the unbated fire That he did pace them first? All things that are, Are with more spirit chased than enjoy’d. How like a younger or a prodigal The scarfed bark puts from her native bay, Hugg’d and embraced by the strumpet wind! How like the prodigal doth she return With over-weather’d ribs and ragged sails, Lean, rent, and beggar’d by the strumpet wind!   Enter Lorenzo.  SALARINO. Here comes Lorenzo, more of this hereafter.  LORENZO. Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode. Not I but my affairs have made you wait. When you shall please to play the thieves for wives, I’ll watch as long for you then. Approach. Here dwells my father Jew. Ho! who’s within?   Enter Jessica above, in boy’s clothes.  JESSICA. Who are you? Tell me, for more certainty, Albeit I’ll swear that I do know your tongue.  LORENZO. Lorenzo, and thy love.  JESSICA. Lorenzo certain, and my love indeed, For who love I so much? And now who knows But you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?  LORENZO. Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art.  JESSICA. Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains. I am glad ’tis night, you do not look on me, For I am much asham’d of my exchange. But love is blind, and lovers cannot see The pretty follies that themselves commit, For if they could, Cupid himself would blush To see me thus transformed to a boy.  LORENZO. Descend, for you must be my torch-bearer.  JESSICA. What! must I hold a candle to my shames? They in themselves, good sooth, are too too light. Why, ’tis an office of discovery, love, And I should be obscur’d.  LORENZO. So are you, sweet, Even in the lovely garnish of a boy. But come at once, For the close night doth play the runaway, And we are stay’d for at Bassanio’s feast.  JESSICA. I will make fast the doors, and gild myself With some moe ducats, and be with you straight.   [_Exit above._]  GRATIANO. Now, by my hood, a gentle, and no Jew.  LORENZO. Beshrew me but I love her heartily, For she is wise, if I can judge of her, And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true, And true she is, as she hath prov’d herself. And therefore, like herself, wise, fair, and true, Shall she be placed in my constant soul.   Enter Jessica.  What, art thou come? On, gentlemen, away! Our masquing mates by this time for us stay.   [_Exit with Jessica and Salarino._]   Enter Antonio.  ANTONIO. Who’s there?  GRATIANO. Signior Antonio!  ANTONIO. Fie, fie, Gratiano! where are all the rest? ’Tis nine o’clock, our friends all stay for you. No masque tonight, the wind is come about; Bassanio presently will go aboard. I have sent twenty out to seek for you.  GRATIANO. I am glad on’t. I desire no more delight Than to be under sail and gone tonight.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE VII. Belmont. A room in Portia’s house.   Flourish of cornets. Enter Portia with the Prince of Morocco and both  their trains.  PORTIA. Go, draw aside the curtains and discover The several caskets to this noble prince. Now make your choice.  PRINCE OF MOROCCO. The first, of gold, who this inscription bears, “Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.” The second, silver, which this promise carries, “Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.” This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt, “Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.” How shall I know if I do choose the right?  PORTIA. The one of them contains my picture, prince. If you choose that, then I am yours withal.  PRINCE OF MOROCCO. Some god direct my judgment! Let me see. I will survey the inscriptions back again. What says this leaden casket? “Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.” Must give, for what? For lead? Hazard for lead! This casket threatens; men that hazard all Do it in hope of fair advantages: A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross, I’ll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead. What says the silver with her virgin hue? “Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.” As much as he deserves! Pause there, Morocco, And weigh thy value with an even hand. If thou be’st rated by thy estimation Thou dost deserve enough, and yet enough May not extend so far as to the lady. And yet to be afeard of my deserving Were but a weak disabling of myself. As much as I deserve! Why, that’s the lady: I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes, In graces, and in qualities of breeding; But more than these, in love I do deserve. What if I stray’d no farther, but chose here? Let’s see once more this saying grav’d in gold: “Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.” Why, that’s the lady, all the world desires her. From the four corners of the earth they come To kiss this shrine, this mortal breathing saint. The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds Of wide Arabia are as throughfares now For princes to come view fair Portia. The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head Spets in the face of heaven, is no bar To stop the foreign spirits, but they come As o’er a brook to see fair Portia. One of these three contains her heavenly picture. Is’t like that lead contains her? ’Twere damnation To think so base a thought. It were too gross To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave. Or shall I think in silver she’s immur’d Being ten times undervalued to tried gold? O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem Was set in worse than gold. They have in England A coin that bears the figure of an angel Stamped in gold; but that’s insculp’d upon; But here an angel in a golden bed Lies all within. Deliver me the key. Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may.  PORTIA. There, take it, prince, and if my form lie there, Then I am yours.   [_He unlocks the golden casket._]  PRINCE OF MOROCCO. O hell! what have we here? A carrion Death, within whose empty eye There is a written scroll. I’ll read the writing.       _All that glisters is not gold,      Often have you heard that told.      Many a man his life hath sold      But my outside to behold.      Gilded tombs do worms infold.      Had you been as wise as bold,      Young in limbs, in judgment old,      Your answer had not been inscroll’d,      Fare you well, your suit is cold._     Cold indeed and labour lost,    Then farewell heat, and welcome frost. Portia, adieu! I have too griev’d a heart To take a tedious leave. Thus losers part.   [_Exit with his train. Flourish of cornets._]  PORTIA. A gentle riddance. Draw the curtains, go. Let all of his complexion choose me so.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE VIII. Venice. A street.   Enter Salarino and Solanio.  SALARINO. Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail; With him is Gratiano gone along; And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not.  SOLANIO. The villain Jew with outcries rais’d the Duke, Who went with him to search Bassanio’s ship.  SALARINO. He came too late, the ship was under sail; But there the Duke was given to understand That in a gondola were seen together Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica. Besides, Antonio certified the Duke They were not with Bassanio in his ship.  SOLANIO. I never heard a passion so confus’d, So strange, outrageous, and so variable As the dog Jew did utter in the streets. “My daughter! O my ducats! O my daughter! Fled with a Christian! O my Christian ducats! Justice! the law! my ducats and my daughter! A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats, Of double ducats, stol’n from me by my daughter! And jewels, two stones, two rich and precious stones, Stol’n by my daughter! Justice! find the girl, She hath the stones upon her and the ducats.”  SALARINO. Why, all the boys in Venice follow him, Crying, his stones, his daughter, and his ducats.  SOLANIO. Let good Antonio look he keep his day Or he shall pay for this.  SALARINO. Marry, well rememb’red. I reason’d with a Frenchman yesterday, Who told me, in the narrow seas that part The French and English, there miscarried A vessel of our country richly fraught. I thought upon Antonio when he told me, And wish’d in silence that it were not his.  SOLANIO. You were best to tell Antonio what you hear, Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.  SALARINO. A kinder gentleman treads not the earth. I saw Bassanio and Antonio part, Bassanio told him he would make some speed Of his return. He answered “Do not so, Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio, But stay the very riping of the time, And for the Jew’s bond which he hath of me, Let it not enter in your mind of love: Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts To courtship, and such fair ostents of love As shall conveniently become you there.” And even there, his eye being big with tears, Turning his face, he put his hand behind him, And with affection wondrous sensible He wrung Bassanio’s hand, and so they parted.  SOLANIO. I think he only loves the world for him. I pray thee, let us go and find him out And quicken his embraced heaviness With some delight or other.  SALARINO. Do we so.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IX. Belmont. A room in Portia’s house.   Enter Nerissa and a Servitor.  NERISSA. Quick, quick, I pray thee, draw the curtain straight. The Prince of Arragon hath ta’en his oath, And comes to his election presently.   Flourish of cornets. Enter the Prince of Arragon, his train, and  Portia.  PORTIA. Behold, there stand the caskets, noble Prince, If you choose that wherein I am contain’d, Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemniz’d. But if you fail, without more speech, my lord, You must be gone from hence immediately.  ARRAGON. I am enjoin’d by oath to observe three things: First, never to unfold to anyone Which casket ’twas I chose; next, if I fail Of the right casket, never in my life To woo a maid in way of marriage; Lastly, If I do fail in fortune of my choice, Immediately to leave you and be gone.  PORTIA. To these injunctions everyone doth swear That comes to hazard for my worthless self.  ARRAGON. And so have I address’d me. Fortune now To my heart’s hope! Gold, silver, and base lead. “Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.” You shall look fairer ere I give or hazard. What says the golden chest? Ha! let me see: “Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.” What many men desire! that “many” may be meant By the fool multitude, that choose by show, Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach, Which pries not to th’ interior, but like the martlet Builds in the weather on the outward wall, Even in the force and road of casualty. I will not choose what many men desire, Because I will not jump with common spirits And rank me with the barbarous multitudes. Why, then to thee, thou silver treasure-house, Tell me once more what title thou dost bear. “Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.” And well said too; for who shall go about To cozen fortune, and be honourable Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume To wear an undeserved dignity. O that estates, degrees, and offices Were not deriv’d corruptly, and that clear honour Were purchas’d by the merit of the wearer! How many then should cover that stand bare? How many be commanded that command? How much low peasantry would then be gleaned From the true seed of honour? And how much honour Pick’d from the chaff and ruin of the times, To be new varnish’d? Well, but to my choice. “Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.” I will assume desert. Give me a key for this, And instantly unlock my fortunes here.   [_He opens the silver casket._]  PORTIA. Too long a pause for that which you find there.  ARRAGON. What’s here? The portrait of a blinking idiot Presenting me a schedule! I will read it. How much unlike art thou to Portia! How much unlike my hopes and my deservings! “Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves.” Did I deserve no more than a fool’s head? Is that my prize? Are my deserts no better?  PORTIA. To offend and judge are distinct offices, And of opposed natures.  ARRAGON. What is here?       _The fire seven times tried this;      Seven times tried that judgment is      That did never choose amiss.      Some there be that shadows kiss;      Such have but a shadow’s bliss.      There be fools alive, I wis,      Silver’d o’er, and so was this.      Take what wife you will to bed,      I will ever be your head:      So be gone; you are sped._  Still more fool I shall appear By the time I linger here. With one fool’s head I came to woo, But I go away with two. Sweet, adieu! I’ll keep my oath, Patiently to bear my wroth.   [_Exit Arragon with his train._]  PORTIA. Thus hath the candle sing’d the moth. O, these deliberate fools! When they do choose, They have the wisdom by their wit to lose.  NERISSA. The ancient saying is no heresy: Hanging and wiving goes by destiny.  PORTIA. Come, draw the curtain, Nerissa.   Enter a Messenger.  MESSENGER. Where is my lady?  PORTIA. Here. What would my lord?  MESSENGER. Madam, there is alighted at your gate A young Venetian, one that comes before To signify th’ approaching of his lord, From whom he bringeth sensible regreets; To wit (besides commends and courteous breath) Gifts of rich value; yet I have not seen So likely an ambassador of love. A day in April never came so sweet, To show how costly summer was at hand, As this fore-spurrer comes before his lord.  PORTIA. No more, I pray thee. I am half afeard Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee, Thou spend’st such high-day wit in praising him. Come, come, Nerissa, for I long to see Quick Cupid’s post that comes so mannerly.  NERISSA. Bassanio, Lord Love, if thy will it be!   [_Exeunt._]
ACT III  SCENE I. Venice. A street.   Enter Solanio and Salarino.  SOLANIO. Now, what news on the Rialto?  SALARINO. Why, yet it lives there unchecked that Antonio hath a ship of rich lading wrack’d on the narrow seas; the Goodwins, I think they call the place, a very dangerous flat and fatal, where the carcasses of many a tall ship lie buried, as they say, if my gossip Report be an honest woman of her word.  SOLANIO. I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapped ginger or made her neighbours believe she wept for the death of a third husband. But it is true, without any slips of prolixity or crossing the plain highway of talk, that the good Antonio, the honest Antonio,—O that I had a title good enough to keep his name company!—  SALARINO. Come, the full stop.  SOLANIO. Ha, what sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath lost a ship.  SALARINO. I would it might prove the end of his losses.  SOLANIO. Let me say “amen” betimes, lest the devil cross my prayer, for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew.   Enter Shylock.  How now, Shylock, what news among the merchants?  SHYLOCK. You knew, none so well, none so well as you, of my daughter’s flight.  SALARINO. That’s certain, I, for my part, knew the tailor that made the wings she flew withal.  SOLANIO. And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was fledged; and then it is the complexion of them all to leave the dam.  SHYLOCK. She is damn’d for it.  SALARINO. That’s certain, if the devil may be her judge.  SHYLOCK. My own flesh and blood to rebel!  SOLANIO. Out upon it, old carrion! Rebels it at these years?  SHYLOCK. I say my daughter is my flesh and my blood.  SALARINO. There is more difference between thy flesh and hers than between jet and ivory, more between your bloods than there is between red wine and Rhenish. But tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any loss at sea or no?  SHYLOCK. There I have another bad match, a bankrupt, a prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on the Rialto, a beggar that used to come so smug upon the mart; let him look to his bond. He was wont to call me usurer; let him look to his bond: he was wont to lend money for a Christian cur’sy; let him look to his bond.  SALARINO. Why, I am sure if he forfeit, thou wilt not take his flesh! What’s that good for?  SHYLOCK. To bait fish withal; if it will feed nothing else, it will feed my revenge. He hath disgrac’d me and hind’red me half a million, laugh’d at my losses, mock’d at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine enemies. And what’s his reason? I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions? Fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian example? Why, revenge! The villainy you teach me I will execute, and it shall go hard but I will better the instruction.   Enter a man from Antonio.  SERVANT. Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house, and desires to speak with you both.  SALARINO. We have been up and down to seek him.   Enter Tubal.  SOLANIO. Here comes another of the tribe; a third cannot be match’d, unless the devil himself turn Jew.   [_Exeunt Solanio, Salarino and the Servant._]  SHYLOCK. How now, Tubal, what news from Genoa? Hast thou found my daughter?  TUBAL. I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her.  SHYLOCK. Why there, there, there, there! A diamond gone cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfort! The curse never fell upon our nation till now, I never felt it till now. Two thousand ducats in that, and other precious, precious jewels. I would my daughter were dead at my foot, and the jewels in her ear; would she were hearsed at my foot, and the ducats in her coffin. No news of them? Why so? And I know not what’s spent in the search. Why, thou—loss upon loss! The thief gone with so much, and so much to find the thief, and no satisfaction, no revenge, nor no ill luck stirring but what lights o’ my shoulders, no sighs but o’ my breathing, no tears but o’ my shedding.  TUBAL. Yes, other men have ill luck too. Antonio, as I heard in Genoa—  SHYLOCK. What, what, what? Ill luck, ill luck?  TUBAL. —hath an argosy cast away coming from Tripolis.  SHYLOCK. I thank God! I thank God! Is it true, is it true?  TUBAL. I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wrack.  SHYLOCK. I thank thee, good Tubal. Good news, good news! Ha, ha, heard in Genoa?  TUBAL. Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, one night, fourscore ducats.  SHYLOCK. Thou stick’st a dagger in me. I shall never see my gold again. Fourscore ducats at a sitting! Fourscore ducats!  TUBAL. There came divers of Antonio’s creditors in my company to Venice that swear he cannot choose but break.  SHYLOCK. I am very glad of it. I’ll plague him, I’ll torture him. I am glad of it.  TUBAL. One of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter for a monkey.  SHYLOCK. Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal. It was my turquoise, I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor. I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.  TUBAL. But Antonio is certainly undone.  SHYLOCK. Nay, that’s true, that’s very true. Go, Tubal, fee me an officer; bespeak him a fortnight before. I will have the heart of him if he forfeit, for were he out of Venice I can make what merchandise I will. Go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue. Go, good Tubal, at our synagogue, Tubal.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. Belmont. A room in Portia’s house.   Enter Bassanio, Portia, Gratiano, Nerissa and all their trains.  PORTIA. I pray you tarry, pause a day or two Before you hazard, for in choosing wrong I lose your company; therefore forbear a while. There’s something tells me (but it is not love) I would not lose you, and you know yourself Hate counsels not in such a quality. But lest you should not understand me well,— And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought,— I would detain you here some month or two Before you venture for me. I could teach you How to choose right, but then I am forsworn. So will I never be. So may you miss me. But if you do, you’ll make me wish a sin, That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes, They have o’erlook’d me and divided me. One half of me is yours, the other half yours, Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours, And so all yours. O these naughty times Puts bars between the owners and their rights! And so though yours, not yours. Prove it so, Let Fortune go to hell for it, not I. I speak too long, but ’tis to peise the time, To eche it, and to draw it out in length, To stay you from election.  BASSANIO. Let me choose, For as I am, I live upon the rack.  PORTIA. Upon the rack, Bassanio! Then confess What treason there is mingled with your love.  BASSANIO. None but that ugly treason of mistrust, Which makes me fear th’ enjoying of my love. There may as well be amity and life ’Tween snow and fire as treason and my love.  PORTIA. Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack Where men enforced do speak anything.  BASSANIO. Promise me life, and I’ll confess the truth.  PORTIA. Well then, confess and live.  BASSANIO. “Confess and love” Had been the very sum of my confession: O happy torment, when my torturer Doth teach me answers for deliverance! But let me to my fortune and the caskets.  PORTIA. Away, then! I am lock’d in one of them. If you do love me, you will find me out. Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof. Let music sound while he doth make his choice. Then if he lose he makes a swan-like end, Fading in music. That the comparison May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream And wat’ry death-bed for him. He may win, And what is music then? Then music is Even as the flourish when true subjects bow To a new-crowned monarch. Such it is As are those dulcet sounds in break of day That creep into the dreaming bridegroom’s ear And summon him to marriage. Now he goes, With no less presence, but with much more love Than young Alcides when he did redeem The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy To the sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice; The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives, With bleared visages come forth to view The issue of th’ exploit. Go, Hercules! Live thou, I live. With much much more dismay I view the fight than thou that mak’st the fray.   A song, whilst Bassanio comments on the caskets to himself.       _Tell me where is fancy bred,      Or in the heart or in the head?      How begot, how nourished?         Reply, reply.      It is engend’red in the eyes,      With gazing fed, and fancy dies      In the cradle where it lies.         Let us all ring fancy’s knell:         I’ll begin it.—Ding, dong, bell._  ALL.      _Ding, dong, bell._  BASSANIO. So may the outward shows be least themselves. The world is still deceiv’d with ornament. In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt But, being season’d with a gracious voice, Obscures the show of evil? In religion, What damned error but some sober brow Will bless it, and approve it with a text, Hiding the grossness with fair ornament? There is no vice so simple but assumes Some mark of virtue on his outward parts. How many cowards, whose hearts are all as false As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars, Who inward search’d, have livers white as milk, And these assume but valour’s excrement To render them redoubted. Look on beauty, And you shall see ’tis purchas’d by the weight, Which therein works a miracle in nature, Making them lightest that wear most of it: So are those crisped snaky golden locks Which make such wanton gambols with the wind Upon supposed fairness, often known To be the dowry of a second head, The skull that bred them in the sepulchre. Thus ornament is but the guiled shore To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word, The seeming truth which cunning times put on To entrap the wisest. Therefore thou gaudy gold, Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee, Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge ’Tween man and man: but thou, thou meagre lead, Which rather threaten’st than dost promise aught, Thy palenness moves me more than eloquence, And here choose I, joy be the consequence!  PORTIA. [_Aside._] How all the other passions fleet to air, As doubtful thoughts, and rash-embrac’d despair, And shudd’ring fear, and green-ey’d jealousy. O love, be moderate; allay thy ecstasy, In measure rain thy joy; scant this excess! I feel too much thy blessing, make it less, For fear I surfeit.  BASSANIO. What find I here? [_Opening the leaden casket_.] Fair Portia’s counterfeit! What demi-god Hath come so near creation? Move these eyes? Or whether, riding on the balls of mine, Seem they in motion? Here are sever’d lips, Parted with sugar breath, so sweet a bar Should sunder such sweet friends. Here in her hairs The painter plays the spider, and hath woven A golden mesh t’entrap the hearts of men Faster than gnats in cobwebs. But her eyes!— How could he see to do them? Having made one, Methinks it should have power to steal both his And leave itself unfurnish’d. Yet look how far The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow In underprizing it, so far this shadow Doth limp behind the substance. Here’s the scroll, The continent and summary of my fortune.       _You that choose not by the view      Chance as fair and choose as true!      Since this fortune falls to you,      Be content and seek no new.      If you be well pleas’d with this,      And hold your fortune for your bliss,      Turn to where your lady is,      And claim her with a loving kiss._  A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave, [_Kissing her_.] I come by note to give and to receive. Like one of two contending in a prize That thinks he hath done well in people’s eyes, Hearing applause and universal shout, Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt Whether those peals of praise be his or no, So, thrice-fair lady, stand I even so, As doubtful whether what I see be true, Until confirm’d, sign’d, ratified by you.  PORTIA. You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand, Such as I am; though for myself alone I would not be ambitious in my wish To wish myself much better, yet for you I would be trebled twenty times myself, A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times More rich, That only to stand high in your account, I might in virtues, beauties, livings, friends, Exceed account. But the full sum of me Is sum of something, which, to term in gross, Is an unlesson’d girl, unschool’d, unpractis’d; Happy in this, she is not yet so old But she may learn; happier than this, She is not bred so dull but she can learn; Happiest of all, is that her gentle spirit Commits itself to yours to be directed, As from her lord, her governor, her king. Myself, and what is mine, to you and yours Is now converted. But now I was the lord Of this fair mansion, master of my servants, Queen o’er myself; and even now, but now, This house, these servants, and this same myself Are yours,—my lord’s. I give them with this ring, Which when you part from, lose, or give away, Let it presage the ruin of your love, And be my vantage to exclaim on you.  BASSANIO. Madam, you have bereft me of all words, Only my blood speaks to you in my veins, And there is such confusion in my powers As after some oration fairly spoke By a beloved prince, there doth appear Among the buzzing pleased multitude, Where every something being blent together, Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy Express’d and not express’d. But when this ring Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence. O then be bold to say Bassanio’s dead!  NERISSA. My lord and lady, it is now our time, That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper, To cry, good joy. Good joy, my lord and lady!  GRATIANO. My Lord Bassanio, and my gentle lady, I wish you all the joy that you can wish; For I am sure you can wish none from me. And when your honours mean to solemnize The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you Even at that time I may be married too.  BASSANIO. With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.  GRATIANO. I thank your lordship, you have got me one. My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours: You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid. You lov’d, I lov’d; for intermission No more pertains to me, my lord, than you. Your fortune stood upon the caskets there, And so did mine too, as the matter falls. For wooing here until I sweat again, And swearing till my very roof was dry With oaths of love, at last, (if promise last) I got a promise of this fair one here To have her love, provided that your fortune Achiev’d her mistress.  PORTIA. Is this true, Nerissa?  NERISSA. Madam, it is, so you stand pleas’d withal.  BASSANIO. And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?  GRATIANO. Yes, faith, my lord.  BASSANIO. Our feast shall be much honoured in your marriage.  GRATIANO. We’ll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats.  NERISSA. What! and stake down?  GRATIANO. No, we shall ne’er win at that sport and stake down. But who comes here? Lorenzo and his infidel? What, and my old Venetian friend, Salerio!   Enter Lorenzo, Jessica and Salerio.  BASSANIO. Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither, If that the youth of my new int’rest here Have power to bid you welcome. By your leave, I bid my very friends and countrymen, Sweet Portia, welcome.  PORTIA. So do I, my lord, They are entirely welcome.  LORENZO. I thank your honour. For my part, my lord, My purpose was not to have seen you here, But meeting with Salerio by the way, He did entreat me, past all saying nay, To come with him along.  SALERIO. I did, my lord, And I have reason for it. Signior Antonio Commends him to you.   [_Gives Bassanio a letter._]  BASSANIO. Ere I ope his letter, I pray you tell me how my good friend doth.  SALERIO. Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind, Nor well, unless in mind. His letter there Will show you his estate.   [_Bassanio opens the letter._]  GRATIANO. Nerissa, cheer yond stranger, bid her welcome. Your hand, Salerio. What’s the news from Venice? How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio? I know he will be glad of our success. We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece.  SALERIO. I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.  PORTIA. There are some shrewd contents in yond same paper That steals the colour from Bassanio’s cheek. Some dear friend dead, else nothing in the world Could turn so much the constitution Of any constant man. What, worse and worse? With leave, Bassanio, I am half yourself, And I must freely have the half of anything That this same paper brings you.  BASSANIO. O sweet Portia, Here are a few of the unpleasant’st words That ever blotted paper. Gentle lady, When I did first impart my love to you, I freely told you all the wealth I had Ran in my veins, I was a gentleman. And then I told you true. And yet, dear lady, Rating myself at nothing, you shall see How much I was a braggart. When I told you My state was nothing, I should then have told you That I was worse than nothing; for indeed I have engag’d myself to a dear friend, Engag’d my friend to his mere enemy, To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady, The paper as the body of my friend, And every word in it a gaping wound Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio? Hath all his ventures fail’d? What, not one hit? From Tripolis, from Mexico, and England, From Lisbon, Barbary, and India, And not one vessel scape the dreadful touch Of merchant-marring rocks?  SALERIO. Not one, my lord. Besides, it should appear, that if he had The present money to discharge the Jew, He would not take it. Never did I know A creature that did bear the shape of man So keen and greedy to confound a man. He plies the Duke at morning and at night, And doth impeach the freedom of the state If they deny him justice. Twenty merchants, The Duke himself, and the magnificoes Of greatest port have all persuaded with him, But none can drive him from the envious plea Of forfeiture, of justice, and his bond.  JESSICA. When I was with him, I have heard him swear To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen, That he would rather have Antonio’s flesh Than twenty times the value of the sum That he did owe him. And I know, my lord, If law, authority, and power deny not, It will go hard with poor Antonio.  PORTIA. Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?  BASSANIO. The dearest friend to me, the kindest man, The best condition’d and unwearied spirit In doing courtesies, and one in whom The ancient Roman honour more appears Than any that draws breath in Italy.  PORTIA. What sum owes he the Jew?  BASSANIO. For me three thousand ducats.  PORTIA. What, no more? Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond. Double six thousand, and then treble that, Before a friend of this description Shall lose a hair through Bassanio’s fault. First go with me to church and call me wife, And then away to Venice to your friend. For never shall you lie by Portia’s side With an unquiet soul. You shall have gold To pay the petty debt twenty times over. When it is paid, bring your true friend along. My maid Nerissa and myself meantime, Will live as maids and widows. Come, away! For you shall hence upon your wedding day. Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer; Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear. But let me hear the letter of your friend.  BASSANIO. _Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all miscarried, my creditors grow cruel, my estate is very low, my bond to the Jew is forfeit, and since in paying it, it is impossible I should live, all debts are clear’d between you and I, if I might but see you at my death. Notwithstanding, use your pleasure. If your love do not persuade you to come, let not my letter._  PORTIA. O love, dispatch all business and be gone!  BASSANIO. Since I have your good leave to go away, I will make haste; but, till I come again, No bed shall e’er be guilty of my stay, Nor rest be interposer ’twixt us twain.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. Venice. A street.   Enter Shylock, Salarino, Antonio and Gaoler.  SHYLOCK. Gaoler, look to him. Tell not me of mercy. This is the fool that lent out money gratis. Gaoler, look to him.  ANTONIO. Hear me yet, good Shylock.  SHYLOCK. I’ll have my bond, speak not against my bond. I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond. Thou call’dst me dog before thou hadst a cause, But since I am a dog, beware my fangs; The Duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder, Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond To come abroad with him at his request.  ANTONIO. I pray thee hear me speak.  SHYLOCK. I’ll have my bond. I will not hear thee speak. I’ll have my bond, and therefore speak no more. I’ll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool, To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield To Christian intercessors. Follow not, I’ll have no speaking, I will have my bond.   [_Exit._]  SALARINO. It is the most impenetrable cur That ever kept with men.  ANTONIO. Let him alone. I’ll follow him no more with bootless prayers. He seeks my life, his reason well I know: I oft deliver’d from his forfeitures Many that have at times made moan to me. Therefore he hates me.  SALARINO. I am sure the Duke Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.  ANTONIO. The Duke cannot deny the course of law, For the commodity that strangers have With us in Venice, if it be denied, ’Twill much impeach the justice of the state, Since that the trade and profit of the city Consisteth of all nations. Therefore, go. These griefs and losses have so bated me That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh Tomorrow to my bloody creditor. Well, gaoler, on, pray God Bassanio come To see me pay his debt, and then I care not.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IV. Belmont. A room in Portia’s house.   Enter Portia, Nerissa, Lorenzo, Jessica and Balthazar.  LORENZO. Madam, although I speak it in your presence, You have a noble and a true conceit Of godlike amity, which appears most strongly In bearing thus the absence of your lord. But if you knew to whom you show this honour, How true a gentleman you send relief, How dear a lover of my lord your husband, I know you would be prouder of the work Than customary bounty can enforce you.  PORTIA. I never did repent for doing good, Nor shall not now; for in companions That do converse and waste the time together, Whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love, There must be needs a like proportion Of lineaments, of manners, and of spirit; Which makes me think that this Antonio, Being the bosom lover of my lord, Must needs be like my lord. If it be so, How little is the cost I have bestowed In purchasing the semblance of my soul From out the state of hellish cruelty! This comes too near the praising of myself; Therefore no more of it. Hear other things. Lorenzo, I commit into your hands The husbandry and manage of my house Until my lord’s return. For mine own part, I have toward heaven breath’d a secret vow To live in prayer and contemplation, Only attended by Nerissa here, Until her husband and my lord’s return. There is a monastery two miles off, And there we will abide. I do desire you Not to deny this imposition, The which my love and some necessity Now lays upon you.  LORENZO. Madam, with all my heart I shall obey you in all fair commands.  PORTIA. My people do already know my mind, And will acknowledge you and Jessica In place of Lord Bassanio and myself. So fare you well till we shall meet again.  LORENZO. Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you!  JESSICA. I wish your ladyship all heart’s content.  PORTIA. I thank you for your wish, and am well pleas’d To wish it back on you. Fare you well, Jessica.   [_Exeunt Jessica and Lorenzo._]  Now, Balthazar, As I have ever found thee honest-true, So let me find thee still. Take this same letter, And use thou all th’ endeavour of a man In speed to Padua, see thou render this Into my cousin’s hands, Doctor Bellario; And look what notes and garments he doth give thee, Bring them, I pray thee, with imagin’d speed Unto the traject, to the common ferry Which trades to Venice. Waste no time in words, But get thee gone. I shall be there before thee.  BALTHAZAR. Madam, I go with all convenient speed.   [_Exit._]  PORTIA. Come on, Nerissa, I have work in hand That you yet know not of; we’ll see our husbands Before they think of us.  NERISSA. Shall they see us?  PORTIA. They shall, Nerissa, but in such a habit That they shall think we are accomplished With that we lack. I’ll hold thee any wager, When we are both accoutered like young men, I’ll prove the prettier fellow of the two, And wear my dagger with the braver grace, And speak between the change of man and boy With a reed voice; and turn two mincing steps Into a manly stride; and speak of frays Like a fine bragging youth; and tell quaint lies How honourable ladies sought my love, Which I denying, they fell sick and died; I could not do withal. Then I’ll repent, And wish for all that, that I had not kill’d them. And twenty of these puny lies I’ll tell, That men shall swear I have discontinued school About a twelvemonth. I have within my mind A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks, Which I will practise.  NERISSA. Why, shall we turn to men?  PORTIA. Fie, what a question’s that, If thou wert near a lewd interpreter! But come, I’ll tell thee all my whole device When I am in my coach, which stays for us At the park gate; and therefore haste away, For we must measure twenty miles today.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE V. The same. A garden.   Enter Launcelet and Jessica.  LAUNCELET. Yes, truly, for look you, the sins of the father are to be laid upon the children, therefore, I promise you, I fear you. I was always plain with you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter. Therefore be of good cheer, for truly I think you are damn’d. There is but one hope in it that can do you any good, and that is but a kind of bastard hope neither.  JESSICA. And what hope is that, I pray thee?  LAUNCELET. Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you not, that you are not the Jew’s daughter.  JESSICA. That were a kind of bastard hope indeed; so the sins of my mother should be visited upon me.  LAUNCELET. Truly then I fear you are damn’d both by father and mother; thus when I shun Scylla your father, I fall into Charybdis your mother. Well, you are gone both ways.  JESSICA. I shall be saved by my husband. He hath made me a Christian.  LAUNCELET. Truly the more to blame he, we were Christians enow before, e’en as many as could well live one by another. This making of Christians will raise the price of hogs; if we grow all to be pork-eaters, we shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money.   Enter Lorenzo.  JESSICA. I’ll tell my husband, Launcelet, what you say. Here he comes.  LORENZO. I shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelet, if you thus get my wife into corners!  JESSICA. Nay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo. Launcelet and I are out. He tells me flatly there’s no mercy for me in heaven, because I am a Jew’s daughter; and he says you are no good member of the commonwealth, for in converting Jews to Christians you raise the price of pork.  LORENZO. I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you can the getting up of the negro’s belly! The Moor is with child by you, Launcelet.  LAUNCELET. It is much that the Moor should be more than reason; but if she be less than an honest woman, she is indeed more than I took her for.  LORENZO. How every fool can play upon the word! I think the best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence, and discourse grow commendable in none only but parrots. Go in, sirrah; bid them prepare for dinner.  LAUNCELET. That is done, sir, they have all stomachs.  LORENZO. Goodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you! Then bid them prepare dinner.  LAUNCELET. That is done too, sir, only “cover” is the word.  LORENZO. Will you cover, then, sir?  LAUNCELET. Not so, sir, neither. I know my duty.  LORENZO. Yet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant? I pray thee understand a plain man in his plain meaning: go to thy fellows, bid them cover the table, serve in the meat, and we will come in to dinner.  LAUNCELET. For the table, sir, it shall be served in; for the meat, sir, it shall be covered; for your coming in to dinner, sir, why, let it be as humours and conceits shall govern.   [_Exit._]  LORENZO. O dear discretion, how his words are suited! The fool hath planted in his memory An army of good words, and I do know A many fools that stand in better place, Garnish’d like him, that for a tricksy word Defy the matter. How cheer’st thou, Jessica? And now, good sweet, say thy opinion, How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio’s wife?  JESSICA. Past all expressing. It is very meet The Lord Bassanio live an upright life, For having such a blessing in his lady, He finds the joys of heaven here on earth, And if on earth he do not merit it, In reason he should never come to heaven. Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match, And on the wager lay two earthly women, And Portia one, there must be something else Pawn’d with the other, for the poor rude world Hath not her fellow.  LORENZO. Even such a husband Hast thou of me as she is for a wife.  JESSICA. Nay, but ask my opinion too of that.  LORENZO. I will anon. First let us go to dinner.  JESSICA. Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach.  LORENZO. No pray thee, let it serve for table-talk. Then howsome’er thou speak’st, ’mong other things I shall digest it.  JESSICA. Well, I’ll set you forth.   [_Exeunt._]
ACT V  SCENE I. Belmont. The avenue to Portia’s house.   Enter Lorenzo and Jessica.  LORENZO. The moon shines bright. In such a night as this, When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees, And they did make no noise, in such a night, Troilus methinks mounted the Trojan walls, And sigh’d his soul toward the Grecian tents Where Cressid lay that night.  JESSICA. In such a night Did Thisbe fearfully o’ertrip the dew, And saw the lion’s shadow ere himself, And ran dismay’d away.  LORENZO. In such a night Stood Dido with a willow in her hand Upon the wild sea-banks, and waft her love To come again to Carthage.  JESSICA. In such a night Medea gathered the enchanted herbs That did renew old Æson.  LORENZO. In such a night Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew, And with an unthrift love did run from Venice As far as Belmont.  JESSICA. In such a night Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well, Stealing her soul with many vows of faith, And ne’er a true one.  LORENZO. In such a night Did pretty Jessica, like a little shrew, Slander her love, and he forgave it her.  JESSICA. I would out-night you did no body come; But hark, I hear the footing of a man.   Enter Stephano.  LORENZO. Who comes so fast in silence of the night?  STEPHANO. A friend.  LORENZO. A friend! What friend? Your name, I pray you, friend?  STEPHANO. Stephano is my name, and I bring word My mistress will before the break of day Be here at Belmont. She doth stray about By holy crosses where she kneels and prays For happy wedlock hours.  LORENZO. Who comes with her?  STEPHANO. None but a holy hermit and her maid. I pray you is my master yet return’d?  LORENZO. He is not, nor we have not heard from him. But go we in, I pray thee, Jessica, And ceremoniously let us prepare Some welcome for the mistress of the house.   Enter Launcelet.  LAUNCELET. Sola, sola! wo ha, ho! sola, sola!  LORENZO. Who calls?  LAUNCELET. Sola! Did you see Master Lorenzo? Master Lorenzo! Sola, sola!  LORENZO. Leave holloaing, man. Here!  LAUNCELET. Sola! Where, where?  LORENZO. Here!  LAUNCELET. Tell him there’s a post come from my master with his horn full of good news. My master will be here ere morning.   [_Exit._]  LORENZO. Sweet soul, let’s in, and there expect their coming. And yet no matter; why should we go in? My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you, Within the house, your mistress is at hand, And bring your music forth into the air.   [_Exit Stephano._]  How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank! Here will we sit and let the sounds of music Creep in our ears; soft stillness and the night Become the touches of sweet harmony. Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven Is thick inlaid with patens of bright gold. There’s not the smallest orb which thou behold’st But in his motion like an angel sings, Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins; Such harmony is in immortal souls, But whilst this muddy vesture of decay Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.   Enter Musicians.  Come, ho! and wake Diana with a hymn. With sweetest touches pierce your mistress’ ear, And draw her home with music.   [_Music._]  JESSICA. I am never merry when I hear sweet music.  LORENZO. The reason is, your spirits are attentive. For do but note a wild and wanton herd Or race of youthful and unhandled colts, Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud, Which is the hot condition of their blood, If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound, Or any air of music touch their ears, You shall perceive them make a mutual stand, Their savage eyes turn’d to a modest gaze By the sweet power of music: therefore the poet Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones, and floods, Since naught so stockish, hard, and full of rage, But music for the time doth change his nature. The man that hath no music in himself, Nor is not mov’d with concord of sweet sounds, Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils; The motions of his spirit are dull as night, And his affections dark as Erebus. Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.   Enter Portia and Nerissa.  PORTIA. That light we see is burning in my hall. How far that little candle throws his beams! So shines a good deed in a naughty world.  NERISSA. When the moon shone we did not see the candle.  PORTIA. So doth the greater glory dim the less. A substitute shines brightly as a king Until a king be by, and then his state Empties itself, as doth an inland brook Into the main of waters. Music! hark!  NERISSA. It is your music, madam, of the house.  PORTIA. Nothing is good, I see, without respect. Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.  NERISSA. Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.  PORTIA. The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark When neither is attended; and I think The nightingale, if she should sing by day When every goose is cackling, would be thought No better a musician than the wren. How many things by season season’d are To their right praise and true perfection! Peace! How the moon sleeps with Endymion, And would not be awak’d!   [_Music ceases._]  LORENZO. That is the voice, Or I am much deceiv’d, of Portia.  PORTIA. He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo, By the bad voice.  LORENZO. Dear lady, welcome home.  PORTIA. We have been praying for our husbands’ welfare, Which speed, we hope, the better for our words. Are they return’d?  LORENZO. Madam, they are not yet; But there is come a messenger before To signify their coming.  PORTIA. Go in, Nerissa. Give order to my servants, that they take No note at all of our being absent hence, Nor you, Lorenzo; Jessica, nor you.   [_A tucket sounds._]  LORENZO. Your husband is at hand, I hear his trumpet. We are no tell-tales, madam, fear you not.  PORTIA. This night methinks is but the daylight sick, It looks a little paler. ’Tis a day Such as the day is when the sun is hid.   Enter Bassanio, Antonio, Gratiano and their Followers.  BASSANIO. We should hold day with the Antipodes, If you would walk in absence of the sun.  PORTIA. Let me give light, but let me not be light, For a light wife doth make a heavy husband, And never be Bassanio so for me. But God sort all! You are welcome home, my lord.  BASSANIO. I thank you, madam. Give welcome to my friend. This is the man, this is Antonio, To whom I am so infinitely bound.  PORTIA. You should in all sense be much bound to him, For, as I hear, he was much bound for you.  ANTONIO. No more than I am well acquitted of.  PORTIA. Sir, you are very welcome to our house. It must appear in other ways than words, Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.  GRATIANO. [_To Nerissa_.] By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong, In faith, I gave it to the judge’s clerk. Would he were gelt that had it, for my part, Since you do take it, love, so much at heart.  PORTIA. A quarrel, ho, already! What’s the matter?  GRATIANO. About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring That she did give me, whose posy was For all the world like cutlers’ poetry Upon a knife, “Love me, and leave me not.”  NERISSA. What talk you of the posy, or the value? You swore to me when I did give it you, That you would wear it till your hour of death, And that it should lie with you in your grave. Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths, You should have been respective and have kept it. Gave it a judge’s clerk! No, God’s my judge, The clerk will ne’er wear hair on’s face that had it.  GRATIANO. He will, and if he live to be a man.  NERISSA. Ay, if a woman live to be a man.  GRATIANO. Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth, A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy, No higher than thyself, the judge’s clerk, A prating boy that begg’d it as a fee, I could not for my heart deny it him.  PORTIA. You were to blame,—I must be plain with you,— To part so slightly with your wife’s first gift, A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger, And so riveted with faith unto your flesh. I gave my love a ring, and made him swear Never to part with it, and here he stands. I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it Nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth That the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano, You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief, An ’twere to me I should be mad at it.  BASSANIO. [_Aside._] Why, I were best to cut my left hand off, And swear I lost the ring defending it.  GRATIANO. My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away Unto the judge that begg’d it, and indeed Deserv’d it too. And then the boy, his clerk, That took some pains in writing, he begg’d mine, And neither man nor master would take aught But the two rings.  PORTIA. What ring gave you, my lord? Not that, I hope, which you receiv’d of me.  BASSANIO. If I could add a lie unto a fault, I would deny it, but you see my finger Hath not the ring upon it, it is gone.  PORTIA. Even so void is your false heart of truth. By heaven, I will ne’er come in your bed Until I see the ring.  NERISSA. Nor I in yours Till I again see mine!  BASSANIO. Sweet Portia, If you did know to whom I gave the ring, If you did know for whom I gave the ring, And would conceive for what I gave the ring, And how unwillingly I left the ring, When nought would be accepted but the ring, You would abate the strength of your displeasure.  PORTIA. If you had known the virtue of the ring, Or half her worthiness that gave the ring, Or your own honour to contain the ring, You would not then have parted with the ring. What man is there so much unreasonable, If you had pleas’d to have defended it With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty To urge the thing held as a ceremony? Nerissa teaches me what to believe: I’ll die for’t but some woman had the ring.  BASSANIO. No, by my honour, madam, by my soul, No woman had it, but a civil doctor, Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me, And begg’d the ring, the which I did deny him, And suffer’d him to go displeas’d away, Even he that had held up the very life Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady? I was enforc’d to send it after him. I was beset with shame and courtesy. My honour would not let ingratitude So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady; For by these blessed candles of the night, Had you been there, I think you would have begg’d The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.  PORTIA. Let not that doctor e’er come near my house, Since he hath got the jewel that I loved, And that which you did swear to keep for me, I will become as liberal as you, I’ll not deny him anything I have, No, not my body, nor my husband’s bed. Know him I shall, I am well sure of it. Lie not a night from home. Watch me like Argus, If you do not, if I be left alone, Now by mine honour which is yet mine own, I’ll have that doctor for mine bedfellow.  NERISSA. And I his clerk. Therefore be well advis’d How you do leave me to mine own protection.  GRATIANO. Well, do you so. Let not me take him then, For if I do, I’ll mar the young clerk’s pen.  ANTONIO. I am th’ unhappy subject of these quarrels.  PORTIA. Sir, grieve not you. You are welcome notwithstanding.  BASSANIO. Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong, And in the hearing of these many friends I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes, Wherein I see myself—  PORTIA. Mark you but that! In both my eyes he doubly sees himself, In each eye one. Swear by your double self, And there’s an oath of credit.  BASSANIO. Nay, but hear me. Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear I never more will break an oath with thee.  ANTONIO. I once did lend my body for his wealth, Which but for him that had your husband’s ring Had quite miscarried. I dare be bound again, My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord Will never more break faith advisedly.  PORTIA. Then you shall be his surety. Give him this, And bid him keep it better than the other.  ANTONIO. Here, Lord Bassanio, swear to keep this ring.  BASSANIO. By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!  PORTIA. I had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio, For by this ring, the doctor lay with me.  NERISSA. And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano, For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor’s clerk, In lieu of this, last night did lie with me.  GRATIANO. Why, this is like the mending of highways In summer, where the ways are fair enough. What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserv’d it?  PORTIA. Speak not so grossly. You are all amaz’d. Here is a letter; read it at your leisure. It comes from Padua from Bellario. There you shall find that Portia was the doctor, Nerissa there, her clerk. Lorenzo here Shall witness I set forth as soon as you, And even but now return’d. I have not yet Enter’d my house. Antonio, you are welcome, And I have better news in store for you Than you expect: unseal this letter soon. There you shall find three of your argosies Are richly come to harbour suddenly. You shall not know by what strange accident I chanced on this letter.  ANTONIO. I am dumb.  BASSANIO. Were you the doctor, and I knew you not?  GRATIANO. Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?  NERISSA. Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it, Unless he live until he be a man.  BASSANIO. Sweet doctor, you shall be my bedfellow. When I am absent, then lie with my wife.  ANTONIO. Sweet lady, you have given me life and living; For here I read for certain that my ships Are safely come to road.  PORTIA. How now, Lorenzo! My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.  NERISSA. Ay, and I’ll give them him without a fee. There do I give to you and Jessica, From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift, After his death, of all he dies possess’d of.  LORENZO. Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way Of starved people.  PORTIA. It is almost morning, And yet I am sure you are not satisfied Of these events at full. Let us go in, And charge us there upon inter’gatories, And we will answer all things faithfully.  GRATIANO. Let it be so. The first inter’gatory That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is, Whether till the next night she had rather stay, Or go to bed now, being two hours to day. But were the day come, I should wish it dark Till I were couching with the doctor’s clerk. Well, while I live, I’ll fear no other thing So sore as keeping safe Nerissa’s ring.   [_Exeunt._]

  Dramatis Personæ  HOST of the Garter Inn SIR JOHN FALSTAFF ROBIN, page to Falstaff BARDOLPH, follower of Falstaff PISTOL, follower of Falstaff NYM, follower of Falstaff  Robert SHALLOW, a country justice Abraham SLENDER, cousin to Shallow Peter SIMPLE, servant to Slender FENTON, a young gentleman  George PAGE, a Gentleman dwelling at Windsor MISTRESS PAGE, his wife MISTRESS ANNE PAGE, her daughter, in love with Fenton WILLIAM PAGE, a boy, son to Page  Frank FORD, a Gentleman dwelling at Windsor MISTRESS FORD, his wife JOHN, Servant to Ford ROBERT, Servant to Ford  SIR HUGH EVANS, a Welsh parson DOCTOR CAIUS, a French physician MISTRESS QUICKLY, servant to Doctor Caius John RUGBY, servant to Doctor Caius  SERVANTS to Page, &c.  SCENE: Windsor and the neighbourhood
  ACT I  SCENE I. Windsor. Before Page’s house
Enter Justice Shallow, Slender and Sir Hugh Evans.  SHALLOW. Sir Hugh, persuade me not. I will make a Star Chamber matter of it. If he were twenty Sir John Falstaffs, he shall not abuse Robert Shallow, esquire.  SLENDER. In the county of Gloucester, Justice of Peace and Coram.  SHALLOW. Ay, cousin Slender, and Custalorum.  SLENDER. Ay, and Ratolorum too; and a gentleman born, Master Parson, who writes himself “Armigero” in any bill, warrant, quittance, or obligation—“Armigero.”  SHALLOW. Ay, that I do, and have done any time these three hundred years.  SLENDER. All his successors, gone before him hath done’t; and all his ancestors that come after him may. They may give the dozen white luces in their coat.  SHALLOW. It is an old coat.  EVANS. The dozen white louses do become an old coat well. It agrees well, passant. It is a familiar beast to man, and signifies love.  SHALLOW. The luce is the fresh fish. The salt fish is an old coat.  SLENDER. I may quarter, coz.  SHALLOW. You may, by marrying.  EVANS. It is marring indeed, if he quarter it.  SHALLOW. Not a whit.  EVANS. Yes, py’r Lady. If he has a quarter of your coat, there is but three skirts for yourself, in my simple conjectures. But that is all one. If Sir John Falstaff have committed disparagements unto you, I am of the Church, and will be glad to do my benevolence to make atonements and compremises between you.  SHALLOW. The Council shall hear it; it is a riot.  EVANS. It is not meet the Council hear a riot. There is no fear of Got in a riot. The Council, look you, shall desire to hear the fear of Got, and not to hear a riot. Take your vizaments in that.  SHALLOW. Ha! O’ my life, if I were young again, the sword should end it.  EVANS. It is petter that friends is the sword, and end it; and there is also another device in my prain, which peradventure prings goot discretions with it. There is Anne Page, which is daughter to Master George Page, which is pretty virginity.  SLENDER. Mistress Anne Page? She has brown hair, and speaks small like a woman?  EVANS. It is that fery person for all the ’orld, as just as you will desire, and seven hundred pounds of moneys, and gold, and silver, is her grandsire upon his death’s-bed—Got deliver to a joyful resurrections!—give, when she is able to overtake seventeen years old. It were a goot motion if we leave our pribbles and prabbles, and desire a marriage between Master Abraham and Mistress Anne Page.  SHALLOW. Did her grandsire leave her seven hundred pound?  EVANS. Ay, and her father is make her a petter penny.  SHALLOW. I know the young gentlewoman; she has good gifts.  EVANS. Seven hundred pounds, and possibilities, is goot gifts.  SHALLOW. Well, let us see honest Master Page. Is Falstaff there?  EVANS. Shall I tell you a lie? I do despise a liar as I do despise one that is false, or as I despise one that is not true. The knight Sir John is there, and I beseech you be ruled by your well-willers. I will peat the door for Master Page.  [_Knocks._]  What, ho! Got pless your house here!  PAGE. [_Within_.] Who’s there?  EVANS. Here is Got’s plessing, and your friend, and Justice Shallow, and here young Master Slender, that peradventures shall tell you another tale, if matters grow to your likings.  Enter Page.  PAGE. I am glad to see your worships well. I thank you for my venison, Master Shallow.  SHALLOW. Master Page, I am glad to see you, much good do it your good heart! I wished your venison better; it was ill killed. How doth good Mistress Page? And I thank you always with my heart, la, with my heart.  PAGE. Sir, I thank you.  SHALLOW. Sir, I thank you; by yea and no, I do.  PAGE. I am glad to see you, good Master Slender.  SLENDER. How does your fallow greyhound, sir? I heard say he was outrun on Cotsall.  PAGE. It could not be judged, sir.  SLENDER. You’ll not confess, you’ll not confess.  SHALLOW. That he will not. ’Tis your fault; ’tis your fault. ’Tis a good dog.  PAGE. A cur, sir.  SHALLOW. Sir, he’s a good dog, and a fair dog, can there be more said? He is good, and fair. Is Sir John Falstaff here?  PAGE. Sir, he is within; and I would I could do a good office between you.  EVANS. It is spoke as a Christians ought to speak.  SHALLOW. He hath wronged me, Master Page.  PAGE. Sir, he doth in some sort confess it.  SHALLOW. If it be confessed, it is not redressed. Is not that so, Master Page? He hath wronged me, indeed he hath, at a word, he hath. Believe me. Robert Shallow, esquire, saith he is wronged.  PAGE. Here comes Sir John.  Enter Sir John Falstaff, Bardolph, Nym and Pistol.  FALSTAFF. Now, Master Shallow, you’ll complain of me to the King?  SHALLOW. Knight, you have beaten my men, killed my deer, and broke open my lodge.  FALSTAFF. But not kissed your keeper’s daughter!  SHALLOW. Tut, a pin! This shall be answered.  FALSTAFF. I will answer it straight: I have done all this. That is now answered.  SHALLOW. The Council shall know this.  FALSTAFF. ’Twere better for you if it were known in counsel: you’ll be laughed at.  EVANS. _Pauca verba_, Sir John; goot worts.  FALSTAFF. Good worts? Good cabbage!—Slender, I broke your head. What matter have you against me?  SLENDER. Marry, sir, I have matter in my head against you, and against your cony-catching rascals, Bardolph, Nym, and Pistol. They carried me to the tavern and made me drunk, and afterwards picked my pocket.  BARDOLPH. You Banbury cheese!  SLENDER. Ay, it is no matter.  PISTOL. How now, Mephostophilus?  SLENDER. Ay, it is no matter.  NYM. Slice, I say! _Pauca, pauca_, slice, that’s my humour.  SLENDER. Where’s Simple, my man? Can you tell, cousin?  EVANS. Peace, I pray you. Now let us understand; there is three umpires in this matter, as I understand: that is, Master Page, _fidelicet_ Master Page; and there is myself, _fidelicet_ myself; and the three party is, lastly and finally, mine host of the Garter.  PAGE. We three to hear it and end it between them.  EVANS. Fery goot. I will make a prief of it in my notebook, and we will afterwards ’ork upon the cause with as great discreetly as we can.  FALSTAFF. Pistol!  PISTOL. He hears with ears.  EVANS. The tevil and his tam! What phrase is this, “He hears with ear”? Why, it is affectations.  FALSTAFF. Pistol, did you pick Master Slender’s purse?  SLENDER. Ay, by these gloves, did he, or I would I might never come in mine own great chamber again else! Of seven groats in mill-sixpences, and two Edward shovel-boards that cost me two shilling and two pence a-piece of Yed Miller, by these gloves.  FALSTAFF. Is this true, Pistol?  EVANS. No, it is false, if it is a pick-purse.  PISTOL. Ha, thou mountain-foreigner!—Sir John and master mine, I combat challenge of this latten bilbo.— Word of denial in thy _labras_ here! Word of denial! Froth and scum, thou liest.  SLENDER. [_Points at Nym_.] By these gloves, then, ’twas he.  NYM. Be avised, sir, and pass good humours. I will say “marry trap with you”, if you run the nuthook’s humour on me. That is the very note of it.  SLENDER. By this hat, then, he in the red face had it. For though I cannot remember what I did when you made me drunk, yet I am not altogether an ass.  FALSTAFF. What say you, Scarlet and John?  BARDOLPH. Why, sir, for my part, I say the gentleman had drunk himself out of his five sentences.  EVANS. It is his “five senses”. Fie, what the ignorance is!  BARDOLPH. And being fap, sir, was, as they say, cashiered; and so conclusions passed the careers.  SLENDER. Ay, you spake in Latin then too; but ’tis no matter. I’ll ne’er be drunk whilst I live again, but in honest, civil, godly company, for this trick. If I be drunk, I’ll be drunk with those that have the fear of God, and not with drunken knaves.  EVANS. So Got ’udge me, that is a virtuous mind.  FALSTAFF. You hear all these matters denied, gentlemen; you hear it.  Enter Mistress Ford, Mistress Page and her daughter Anne Page with wine.  PAGE Nay, daughter, carry the wine in, we’ll drink within.  [_Exit Anne Page._]  SLENDER O heaven, this is Mistress Anne Page.  PAGE. How now, Mistress Ford?  FALSTAFF. Mistress Ford, by my troth, you are very well met. By your leave, good mistress.  [_Kisses her._]  PAGE. Wife, bid these gentlemen welcome. Come, we have a hot venison pasty to dinner. Come, gentlemen, I hope we shall drink down all unkindness.  [_Exeunt all but Slender._]  SLENDER. I had rather than forty shillings I had my book of _Songs and Sonnets_ here.  Enter Simple.  How now, Simple, where have you been? I must wait on myself, must I? You have not the _Book of Riddles_ about you, have you?  SIMPLE. _Book of Riddles?_ Why, did you not lend it to Alice Shortcake upon Allhallowmas last, a fortnight afore Michaelmas?  Enter Shallow and Sir Hugh Evans.  SHALLOW. Come, coz; come, coz, we stay for you. A word with you, coz. Marry, this, coz: there is, as ’twere, a tender, a kind of tender, made afar off by Sir Hugh here. Do you understand me?  SLENDER. Ay, sir, you shall find me reasonable. If it be so, I shall do that that is reason.  SHALLOW. Nay, but understand me.  SLENDER. So I do, sir.  EVANS. Give ear to his motions, Master Slender. I will description the matter to you, if you be capacity of it.  SLENDER. Nay, I will do as my cousin Shallow says. I pray you pardon me, he’s a Justice of Peace in his country, simple though I stand here.  EVANS. But that is not the question. The question is concerning your marriage.  SHALLOW. Ay, there’s the point, sir.  EVANS. Marry, is it; the very point of it—to Mistress Anne Page.  SLENDER. Why, if it be so, I will marry her upon any reasonable demands.  EVANS. But can you affection the ’oman? Let us command to know that of your mouth, or of your lips; for divers philosophers hold that the lips is parcel of the mouth. Therefore, precisely, can you carry your good will to the maid?  SHALLOW. Cousin Abraham Slender, can you love her?  SLENDER. I hope, sir, I will do as it shall become one that would do reason.  EVANS. Nay, Got’s lords and his ladies! You must speak possitable, if you can carry her your desires towards her.  SHALLOW. That you must. Will you, upon good dowry, marry her?  SLENDER. I will do a greater thing than that, upon your request, cousin, in any reason.  SHALLOW. Nay, conceive me, conceive me, sweet coz. What I do is to pleasure you, coz. Can you love the maid?  SLENDER. I will marry her, sir, at your request. But if there be no great love in the beginning, yet heaven may decrease it upon better acquaintance, when we are married and have more occasion to know one another. I hope upon familiarity will grow more contempt. But if you say “Marry her,” I will marry her. That I am freely dissolved, and dissolutely.  EVANS. It is a fery discretion answer, save the fall is in the ’ord “dissolutely.” The ’ort is, according to our meaning, “resolutely.” His meaning is good.  SHALLOW. Ay, I think my cousin meant well.  SLENDER. Ay, or else I would I might be hanged, la!  SHALLOW. Here comes fair Mistress Anne.  Enter Anne Page.  SHALLOW. Here comes fair Mistress Anne.—Would I were young for your sake, Mistress Anne.  ANNE. The dinner is on the table, my father desires your worships’ company.  SHALLOW. I will wait on him, fair Mistress Anne.  EVANS. ’Od’s plessed will! I will not be absence at the grace.  [_Exeunt Shallow and Sir Hugh Evans._]  ANNE Will’t please your worship to come in, sir?  SLENDER. No, I thank you, forsooth, heartily; I am very well.  ANNE. The dinner attends you, sir.  SLENDER. I am not a-hungry, I thank you, forsooth. [_To Simple_.] Go, sirrah, for all you are my man, go wait upon my cousin Shallow.  [_Exit Simple._]  A Justice of Peace sometime may be beholding to his friend for a man. I keep but three men and a boy yet, till my mother be dead. But what though? Yet I live like a poor gentleman born.  ANNE. I may not go in without your worship. They will not sit till you come.  SLENDER. I’ faith, I’ll eat nothing. I thank you as much as though I did.  ANNE. I pray you, sir, walk in.  SLENDER. I had rather walk here, I thank you. I bruised my shin th’ other day with playing at sword and dagger with a master of fence—three veneys for a dish of stewed prunes—and, by my troth, I cannot abide the smell of hot meat since. Why do your dogs bark so? Be there bears i’ the town?  ANNE. I think there are, sir; I heard them talked of.  SLENDER. I love the sport well, but I shall as soon quarrel at it as any man in England. You are afraid, if you see the bear loose, are you not?  ANNE. Ay, indeed, sir.  SLENDER. That’s meat and drink to me now. I have seen Sackerson loose twenty times, and have taken him by the chain. But, I warrant you, the women have so cried and shrieked at it that it passed. But women, indeed, cannot abide ’em; they are very ill-favoured rough things.  Enter Page.  PAGE Come, gentle Master Slender, come. We stay for you.  SLENDER. I’ll eat nothing, I thank you, sir.  PAGE. By cock and pie, you shall not choose, sir! Come, come.  SLENDER. Nay, pray you lead the way.  PAGE. Come on, sir.  SLENDER. Mistress Anne, yourself shall go first.  ANNE. Not I, sir; pray you keep on.  SLENDER. Truly, I will not go first; truly, la! I will not do you that wrong.  ANNE. I pray you, sir.  SLENDER. I’ll rather be unmannerly than troublesome. You do yourself wrong, indeed, la!  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. The same  Enter Sir Hugh Evans and Simple.  EVANS. Go your ways, and ask of Doctor Caius’ house which is the way. And there dwells one Mistress Quickly, which is in the manner of his nurse, or his dry nurse, or his cook, or his laundry, his washer and his wringer.  SIMPLE. Well, sir.  EVANS. Nay, it is petter yet. Give her this letter. For it is a ’oman that altogether’s acquaintance with Mistress Anne Page; and the letter is to desire and require her to solicit your master’s desires to Mistress Anne Page. I pray you be gone. I will make an end of my dinner; there’s pippins and cheese to come.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. A room in the Garter Inn  Enter Falstaff, Host, Bardolph, Nym, Pistol and Robin.  FALSTAFF. Mine host of the Garter!  HOST. What says my bully rook? Speak scholarly and wisely.  FALSTAFF. Truly, mine host, I must turn away some of my followers.  HOST. Discard, bully Hercules; cashier. Let them wag; trot, trot.  FALSTAFF. I sit at ten pounds a week.  HOST. Thou’rt an emperor—Caesar, Keiser, and Pheazar. I will entertain Bardolph. He shall draw, he shall tap. Said I well, bully Hector?  FALSTAFF. Do so, good mine host.  HOST. I have spoke, let him follow.—Let me see thee froth and lime. I am at a word, follow.  [_Exit Host._]  FALSTAFF. Bardolph, follow him. A tapster is a good trade. An old cloak makes a new jerkin; a withered servingman a fresh tapster. Go, adieu.  BARDOLPH. It is a life that I have desired. I will thrive.  PISTOL. O base Hungarian wight, wilt thou the spigot wield?  [_Exit Bardolph._]  NYM He was gotten in drink. Is not the humour conceited?  FALSTAFF. I am glad I am so acquit of this tinderbox. His thefts were too open. His filching was like an unskilful singer, he kept not time.  NYM. The good humour is to steal at a minute’s rest.  PISTOL. “Convey,” the wise it call. “Steal?” Foh! A _fico_ for the phrase!  FALSTAFF. Well, sirs, I am almost out at heels.  PISTOL. Why, then, let kibes ensue.  FALSTAFF. There is no remedy, I must cony-catch, I must shift.  PISTOL. Young ravens must have food.  FALSTAFF. Which of you know Ford of this town?  PISTOL. I ken the wight, he is of substance good.  FALSTAFF. My honest lads, I will tell you what I am about.  PISTOL. Two yards, and more.  FALSTAFF. No quips now, Pistol. Indeed, I am in the waist two yards about, but I am now about no waste; I am about thrift. Briefly, I do mean to make love to Ford’s wife. I spy entertainment in her. She discourses, she carves, she gives the leer of invitation. I can construe the action of her familiar style; and the hardest voice of her behaviour, to be Englished rightly, is “I am Sir John Falstaff’s.”  PISTOL. He hath studied her will and translated her will—out of honesty into English.  NYM. The anchor is deep. Will that humour pass?  FALSTAFF. Now, the report goes she has all the rule of her husband’s purse. He hath a legion of angels.  PISTOL. As many devils entertain, and “To her, boy,” say I.  NYM. The humour rises; it is good. Humour me the angels.  FALSTAFF. I have writ me here a letter to her; and here another to Page’s wife, who even now gave me good eyes too, examined my parts with most judicious oeillades. Sometimes the beam of her view gilded my foot, sometimes my portly belly.  PISTOL. Then did the sun on dunghill shine.  NYM. I thank thee for that humour.  FALSTAFF. O, she did so course o’er my exteriors with such a greedy intention that the appetite of her eye did seem to scorch me up like a burning-glass. Here’s another letter to her. She bears the purse too; she is a region in Guiana, all gold and bounty. I will be cheaters to them both, and they shall be exchequers to me; they shall be my East and West Indies, and I will trade to them both. Go, bear thou this letter to Mistress Page;—and thou this to Mistress Ford. We will thrive, lads, we will thrive.  PISTOL. Shall I Sir Pandarus of Troy become, And by my side wear steel? Then Lucifer take all!  NYM. I will run no base humour. Here, take the humour-letter. I will keep the ’haviour of reputation.  FALSTAFF. [_To Robin_.] Hold, sirrah, bear you these letters tightly; Sail like my pinnace to these golden shores.— Rogues, hence, avaunt! Vanish like hailstones, go! Trudge, plod away o’ th’ hoof, seek shelter, pack! Falstaff will learn the humour of this age: French thrift, you rogues—myself and skirted page.  [_Exeunt Falstaff and Robin._]  PISTOL Let vultures gripe thy guts! For gourd and fullam holds, And high and low beguile the rich and poor. Tester I’ll have in pouch when thou shalt lack, Base Phrygian Turk!  NYM. I have operations in my head which be humours of revenge.  PISTOL. Wilt thou revenge?  NYM. By welkin and her star!  PISTOL. With wit or steel?  NYM. With both the humours, I. I will discuss the humour of this love to Ford.  PISTOL. And I to Page shall eke unfold How Falstaff, varlet vile, His dove will prove, his gold will hold, And his soft couch defile.  NYM. My humour shall not cool. I will incense Ford to deal with poison, I will possess him with yellowness, for the revolt of mine is dangerous. That is my true humour.  PISTOL. Thou art the Mars of malcontents. I second thee. Troop on.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IV. A room in Doctor Caius’s house  Enter Mistress Quickly and Simple.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. What, John Rugby!  Enter Rugby.  I pray thee go to the casement, and see if you can see my master, Master Doctor Caius, coming. If he do, i’ faith, and find anybody in the house, here will be an old abusing of God’s patience and the King’s English.  RUGBY. I’ll go watch.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. Go; and we’ll have a posset for’t soon at night, in faith, at the latter end of a sea-coal fire.  [_Exit Rugby._]  An honest, willing, kind fellow, as ever servant shall come in house withal; and, I warrant you, no tell-tale nor no breed-bate. His worst fault is that he is given to prayer; he is something peevish that way, but nobody but has his fault. But let that pass. Peter Simple you say your name is?  SIMPLE. Ay, for fault of a better.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. And Master Slender’s your master?  SIMPLE. Ay, forsooth.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. Does he not wear a great round beard, like a glover’s paring-knife?  SIMPLE. No, forsooth, he hath but a little wee face, with a little yellow beard, a Cain-coloured beard.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. A softly-sprighted man, is he not?  SIMPLE. Ay, forsooth. But he is as tall a man of his hands as any is between this and his head. He hath fought with a warrener.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. How say you? O, I should remember him. Does he not hold up his head, as it were, and strut in his gait?  SIMPLE. Yes, indeed, does he.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. Well, heaven send Anne Page no worse fortune! Tell Master Parson Evans I will do what I can for your master. Anne is a good girl, and I wish—  Enter Rugby.  RUGBY Out, alas! Here comes my master.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. We shall all be shent. Run in here, good young man, go into this closet. He will not stay long.  [_Simple steps into the closet._]  What, John Rugby! John! What, John, I say! Go, John, go inquire for my master. I doubt he be not well, that he comes not home.  [_Exit Rugby._]  [_Sings_.] _And down, down, adown-a, etc._  Enter Doctor Caius.  CAIUS Vat is you sing? I do not like dese toys. Pray you, go and vetch me in my closet _une boîtine verte_, a box, a green-a box. Do intend vat I speak? A green-a box.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. Ay, forsooth, I’ll fetch it you. [_Aside_.] I am glad he went not in himself. If he had found the young man, he would have been horn-mad.  CAIUS. _Fe, fe, fe fe! Ma foi, il fait fort chaud. Je m’en vais à la cour—la grande affaire._  MISTRESS QUICKLY. Is it this, sir?  CAIUS. _Oui, mette-le au mon_ pocket. _Dépêche_, quickly—Vere is dat knave Rugby?  MISTRESS QUICKLY. What, John Rugby, John!  Enter Rugby.  RUGBY Here, sir.  CAIUS. You are John Rugby, and you are Jack Rugby. Come, take-a your rapier, and come after my heel to the court.  RUGBY. ’Tis ready, sir, here in the porch.  CAIUS. By my trot, I tarry too long. ’Od’s me! _Qu’ay j’oublié?_ Dere is some simples in my closet dat I vill not for the varld I shall leave behind.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. Ay me, he’ll find the young man there, and be mad!  CAIUS. _O diable, diable!_ Vat is in my closet? Villainy! _Larron!_ [_Pulling Simple out_.] Rugby, my rapier!  MISTRESS QUICKLY. Good master, be content.  CAIUS. Wherefore shall I be content-a?  MISTRESS QUICKLY. The young man is an honest man.  CAIUS. What shall de honest man do in my closet? Dere is no honest man dat shall come in my closet.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. I beseech you, be not so phlegmatic. Hear the truth of it. He came of an errand to me from Parson Hugh.  CAIUS. Vell?  SIMPLE. Ay, forsooth, to desire her to—  MISTRESS QUICKLY. Peace, I pray you.  CAIUS. Peace-a your tongue!—Speak-a your tale.  SIMPLE. To desire this honest gentlewoman, your maid, to speak a good word to Mistress Anne Page for my master in the way of marriage.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. This is all, indeed, la! But I’ll ne’er put my finger in the fire, and need not.  CAIUS. Sir Hugh send-a you?—Rugby, _baille_ me some paper.—Tarry you a little-a while.  [_Writes._]  MISTRESS QUICKLY. [_Aside to Simple_.] I am glad he is so quiet. If he had been throughly moved, you should have heard him so loud and so melancholy. But notwithstanding, man, I’ll do you your master what good I can; and the very yea and the no is, the French doctor, my master—I may call him my master, look you, for I keep his house, and I wash, wring, brew, bake, scour, dress meat and drink, make the beds, and do all myself—  SIMPLE. [_Aside to Mistress Quickly_.] ’Tis a great charge to come under one body’s hand.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. [_Aside to Simple_.] Are you avised o’ that? You shall find it a great charge, and to be up early and down late; but notwithstanding—to tell you in your ear, I would have no words of it—my master himself is in love with Mistress Anne Page; but notwithstanding that, I know Anne’s mind. That’s neither here nor there.  CAIUS. You jack’nape, give-a dis letter to Sir Hugh. By gar, it is a shallenge. I will cut his troat in de park, and I will teach a scurvy jackanape priest to meddle or make. You may be gone, it is not good you tarry here.—By gar, I will cut all his two stones. By gar, he shall not have a stone to throw at his dog.  [_Exit Simple._]  MISTRESS QUICKLY. Alas, he speaks but for his friend.  CAIUS. It is no matter-a ver dat. Do not you tell-a me dat I shall have Anne Page for myself? By gar, I vill kill de Jack priest; and I have appointed mine host of de Jarteer to measure our weapon. By gar, I will myself have Anne Page.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. Sir, the maid loves you, and all shall be well. We must give folks leave to prate. What, the good-year!  CAIUS. Rugby, come to the court with me. [_To Mistress Quickly_.] By gar, if I have not Anne Page, I shall turn your head out of my door.—Follow my heels, Rugby.  [_Exeunt Caius and Rugby._]  MISTRESS QUICKLY. You shall have An—fool’s head of your own. No, I know Anne’s mind for that. Never a woman in Windsor knows more of Anne’s mind than I do, nor can do more than I do with her, I thank heaven.  FENTON. [_Within_.] Who’s within there, ho?  MISTRESS QUICKLY. Who’s there, I trow? Come near the house, I pray you.  Enter Fenton.  FENTON How now, good woman? How dost thou?  MISTRESS QUICKLY. The better, that it pleases your good worship to ask.  FENTON. What news? How does pretty Mistress Anne?  MISTRESS QUICKLY. In truth, sir, and she is pretty, and honest, and gentle; and one that is your friend, I can tell you that by the way, I praise heaven for it.  FENTON. Shall I do any good, think’st thou? Shall I not lose my suit?  MISTRESS QUICKLY. Troth, sir, all is in His hands above. But notwithstanding, Master Fenton, I’ll be sworn on a book she loves you. Have not your worship a wart above your eye?  FENTON. Yes, marry, have I; what of that?  MISTRESS QUICKLY. Well, thereby hangs a tale. Good faith, it is such another Nan! But, I detest, an honest maid as ever broke bread. We had an hour’s talk of that wart. I shall never laugh but in that maid’s company. But, indeed, she is given too much to allicholy and musing. But for you—well, go to.  FENTON. Well, I shall see her today. Hold, there’s money for thee. Let me have thy voice in my behalf. If thou seest her before me, commend me.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. Will I? I’ faith, that we will! And I will tell your worship more of the wart the next time we have confidence, and of other wooers.  FENTON. Well, farewell, I am in great haste now.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. Farewell to your worship.  [_Exit Fenton._]  Truly, an honest gentleman—but Anne loves him not, for I know Anne’s mind as well as another does. Out upon ’t, what have I forgot?  [_Exit._]
  ACT II  SCENE I. Before Page’s house
Enter Mistress Page reading a letter.  MISTRESS PAGE. What, have I scaped love-letters in the holiday-time of my beauty, and am I now a subject for them? Let me see. [_Reads_.] _Ask me no reason why I love you, for though Love use Reason for his precisian, he admits him not for his counsellor. You are not young, no more am I. Go to, then, there’s sympathy. You are merry, so am I. Ha, ha, then there’s more sympathy. You love sack, and so do I. Would you desire better sympathy? Let it suffice thee, Mistress Page, at the least, if the love of soldier can suffice, that I love thee. I will not say, pity me—’tis not a soldier-like phrase—but I say love me. By me,         Thine own true knight,         By day or night,         Or any kind of light,         With all his might,         For thee to fight,         John Falstaff._ What a Herod of Jewry is this! O wicked, wicked world! One that is well-nigh worn to pieces with age, to show himself a young gallant! What an unweighed behaviour hath this Flemish drunkard picked—with the devil’s name!—out of my conversation, that he dares in this manner assay me? Why, he hath not been thrice in my company! What should I say to him? I was then frugal of my mirth. Heaven forgive me! Why, I’ll exhibit a bill in the parliament for the putting down of men. How shall I be revenged on him? For revenged I will be, as sure as his guts are made of puddings.  Enter Mistress Ford.  MISTRESS FORD. Mistress Page! Trust me, I was going to your house.  MISTRESS PAGE. And, trust me, I was coming to you. You look very ill.  MISTRESS FORD. Nay, I’ll ne’er believe that. I have to show to the contrary.  MISTRESS PAGE. Faith, but you do, in my mind.  MISTRESS FORD. Well, I do, then. Yet I say I could show you to the contrary. O, Mistress Page, give me some counsel.  MISTRESS PAGE. What’s the matter, woman?  MISTRESS FORD. O woman, if it were not for one trifling respect, I could come to such honour!  MISTRESS PAGE. Hang the trifle, woman; take the honour. What is it? Dispense with trifles. What is it?  MISTRESS FORD. If I would but go to hell for an eternal moment or so, I could be knighted.  MISTRESS PAGE. What? Thou liest! Sir Alice Ford! These knights will hack, and so thou shouldst not alter the article of thy gentry.  MISTRESS FORD. We burn daylight. Here, read, read. Perceive how I might be knighted. I shall think the worse of fat men as long as I have an eye to make difference of men’s liking. And yet he would not swear; praised women’s modesty; and gave such orderly and well-behaved reproof to all uncomeliness that I would have sworn his disposition would have gone to the truth of his words. But they do no more adhere and keep place together than the Hundredth Psalm to the tune of “Greensleeves.” What tempest, I trow, threw this whale, with so many tuns of oil in his belly, ashore at Windsor? How shall I be revenged on him? I think the best way were to entertain him with hope, till the wicked fire of lust have melted him in his own grease. Did you ever hear the like?  MISTRESS PAGE. Letter for letter, but that the name of Page and Ford differs! To thy great comfort in this mystery of ill opinions, here’s the twin brother of thy letter. But let thine inherit first, for I protest mine never shall. I warrant he hath a thousand of these letters, writ with blank space for different names—sure, more, and these are of the second edition. He will print them, out of doubt; for he cares not what he puts into the press, when he would put us two. I had rather be a giantess and lie under Mount Pelion. Well, I will find you twenty lascivious turtles ere one chaste man.  MISTRESS FORD. Why, this is the very same—the very hand, the very words. What doth he think of us?  MISTRESS PAGE. Nay, I know not. It makes me almost ready to wrangle with mine own honesty. I’ll entertain myself like one that I am not acquainted withal; for, sure, unless he know some strain in me that I know not myself, he would never have boarded me in this fury.  MISTRESS FORD. “Boarding” call you it? I’ll be sure to keep him above deck.  MISTRESS PAGE. So will I. If he come under my hatches, I’ll never to sea again. Let’s be revenged on him. Let’s appoint him a meeting, give him a show of comfort in his suit, and lead him on with a fine-baited delay, till he hath pawned his horses to mine host of the Garter.  MISTRESS FORD. Nay, I will consent to act any villainy against him that may not sully the chariness of our honesty. O, that my husband saw this letter! It would give eternal food to his jealousy.  MISTRESS PAGE. Why, look where he comes; and my good man too. He’s as far from jealousy as I am from giving him cause, and that, I hope, is an unmeasurable distance.  MISTRESS FORD. You are the happier woman.  MISTRESS PAGE. Let’s consult together against this greasy knight. Come hither.  [_They retire._]  Enter Ford with Pistol, and Page with Nym.  FORD Well, I hope it be not so.  PISTOL. Hope is a curtal dog in some affairs. Sir John affects thy wife.  FORD. Why, sir, my wife is not young.  PISTOL. He woos both high and low, both rich and poor, Both young and old, one with another, Ford. He loves the gallimaufry. Ford, perpend.  FORD. Love my wife?  PISTOL. With liver burning hot. Prevent, or go thou like Sir Actaeon he, With Ringwood at thy heels. O, odious is the name!  FORD. What name, sir?  PISTOL. The horn, I say. Farewell. Take heed, have open eye, for thieves do foot by night. Take heed, ere summer comes, or cuckoo birds do sing.— Away, Sir Corporal Nym.—Believe it, Page, he speaks sense.  [_Exit Pistol._]  FORD [_Aside_.] I will be patient. I will find out this.  NYM. [_To Page_.] And this is true, I like not the humour of lying. He hath wronged me in some humours. I should have borne the humoured letter to her; but I have a sword, and it shall bite upon my necessity. He loves your wife; there’s the short and the long. My name is Corporal Nym. I speak, and I avouch ’tis true. My name is Nym, and Falstaff loves your wife. Adieu. I love not the humour of bread and cheese. Adieu.  [_Exit Nym._]  PAGE [_Aside_.] “The humour of it,” quoth ’a! Here’s a fellow frights English out of his wits.  FORD. [_Aside_.] I will seek out Falstaff.  PAGE. [_Aside_.] I never heard such a drawling, affecting rogue.  FORD. [_Aside_.] If I do find it—well.  PAGE. [_Aside_.] I will not believe such a Cataian, though the priest o’ the town commended him for a true man.  FORD. [_Aside_.] ’Twas a good sensible fellow—well.  Mistress Page and Mistress Ford come forward.  PAGE. How now, Meg?  MISTRESS PAGE. Whither go you, George? Hark you.  MISTRESS FORD. How now, sweet Frank, why art thou melancholy?  FORD. I melancholy? I am not melancholy. Get you home, go.  MISTRESS FORD. Faith, thou hast some crotchets in thy head now.—Will you go, Mistress Page?  MISTRESS PAGE. Have with you. You’ll come to dinner, George? [_Aside to Mistress Ford_.] Look who comes yonder. She shall be our messenger to this paltry knight.  MISTRESS FORD. [_Aside to Mistress Page_.] Trust me, I thought on her. She’ll fit it.  Enter Mistress Quickly.  MISTRESS PAGE. You are come to see my daughter Anne?  MISTRESS QUICKLY. Ay, forsooth. And, I pray, how does good Mistress Anne?  MISTRESS PAGE. Go in with us and see. We’d have an hour’s talk with you.  [_Exeunt Mistress Page, Mistress Ford and Mistress Quickly._]  PAGE How now, Master Ford?  FORD. You heard what this knave told me, did you not?  PAGE. Yes, and you heard what the other told me?  FORD. Do you think there is truth in them?  PAGE. Hang ’em, slaves! I do not think the knight would offer it, but these that accuse him in his intent towards our wives are a yoke of his discarded men, very rogues, now they be out of service.  FORD. Were they his men?  PAGE. Marry, were they.  FORD. I like it never the better for that. Does he lie at the Garter?  PAGE. Ay, marry, does he. If he should intend this voyage toward my wife, I would turn her loose to him; and what he gets more of her than sharp words, let it lie on my head.  FORD. I do not misdoubt my wife, but I would be loath to turn them together. A man may be too confident. I would have nothing lie on my head. I cannot be thus satisfied.  Enter Host.  PAGE. Look where my ranting host of the Garter comes. There is either liquor in his pate or money in his purse when he looks so merrily.—How now, mine host?  HOST. How now, bully rook? Thou’rt a gentleman.—Cavaliero Justice, I say!  Enter Shallow.  SHALLOW. I follow, mine host, I follow.—Good even and twenty, good Master Page. Master Page, will you go with us? We have sport in hand.  HOST. Tell him, Cavaliero Justice; tell him, bully rook.  SHALLOW. Sir, there is a fray to be fought between Sir Hugh the Welsh priest and Caius the French doctor.  FORD. Good mine host o’ the Garter, a word with you.  HOST. What say’st thou, my bully rook?  [_Ford and the Host talk apart._]  SHALLOW [_To Page_.] Will you go with us to behold it? My merry host hath had the measuring of their weapons, and, I think, hath appointed them contrary places; for, believe me, I hear the parson is no jester. Hark, I will tell you what our sport shall be.  [_Shallow and Page talk apart. Ford and the Host come forward._]  HOST Hast thou no suit against my knight, my guest cavaliero?  FORD. None, I protest. But I’ll give you a pottle of burnt sack to give me recourse to him, and tell him my name is Brook, only for a jest.  HOST. My hand, bully. Thou shalt have egress and regress—said I well?—and thy name shall be Brook. It is a merry knight. Will you go, myn-heers?  SHALLOW. Have with you, mine host.  PAGE. I have heard the Frenchman hath good skill in his rapier.  SHALLOW. Tut, sir, I could have told you more. In these times you stand on distance—your passes, stoccadoes, and I know not what. ’Tis the heart, Master Page; ’tis here, ’tis here. I have seen the time, with my long sword I would have made you four tall fellows skip like rats.  HOST. Here, boys, here, here! Shall we wag?  PAGE. Have with you. I had rather hear them scold than fight.  [_Exeunt Host, Shallow and Page._]  FORD Though Page be a secure fool, and stands so firmly on his wife’s frailty, yet I cannot put off my opinion so easily. She was in his company at Page’s house, and what they made there I know not. Well, I will look further into ’t, and I have a disguise to sound Falstaff. If I find her honest, I lose not my labour. If she be otherwise, ’tis labour well bestowed.  [_Exit._]  SCENE II. A room in the Garter Inn  Enter Falstaff and Pistol.  FALSTAFF. I will not lend thee a penny.  PISTOL. Why then, the world’s mine oyster, Which I with sword will open.  FALSTAFF. Not a penny. I have been content, sir, you should lay my countenance to pawn; I have grated upon my good friends for three reprieves for you and your coach-fellow Nym, or else you had looked through the grate like a gemini of baboons. I am damned in hell for swearing to gentlemen my friends you were good soldiers and tall fellows. And when Mistress Bridget lost the handle of her fan, I took ’t upon mine honour thou hadst it not.  PISTOL. Didst not thou share? Hadst thou not fifteen pence?  FALSTAFF. Reason, you rogue, reason. Think’st thou I’ll endanger my soul gratis? At a word, hang no more about me, I am no gibbet for you. Go—a short knife and a throng—to your manor of Pickt-hatch, go. You’ll not bear a letter for me, you rogue? You stand upon your honour! Why, thou unconfinable baseness, it is as much as I can do to keep the terms of my honour precise. Ay, ay, I myself sometimes, leaving the fear of God on the left hand, and hiding mine honour in my necessity, am fain to shuffle, to hedge, and to lurch; and yet you, rogue, will ensconce your rags, your cat-a-mountain looks, your red-lattice phrases, and your bold beating oaths, under the shelter of your honour! You will not do it! You!  PISTOL. I do relent. What wouldst thou more of man?  Enter Robin.  ROBIN Sir, here’s a woman would speak with you.  FALSTAFF. Let her approach.  Enter Mistress Quickly.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. Give your worship good morrow.  FALSTAFF. Good morrow, goodwife.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. Not so, an’t please your worship.  FALSTAFF. Good maid, then.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. I’ll be sworn, as my mother was, the first hour I was born.  FALSTAFF. I do believe the swearer. What with me?  MISTRESS QUICKLY. Shall I vouchsafe your worship a word or two?  FALSTAFF. Two thousand, fair woman; and I’ll vouchsafe thee the hearing.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. There is one Mistress Ford, sir—I pray, come a little nearer this ways. I myself dwell with Master Doctor Caius.  FALSTAFF. Well, on; Mistress Ford, you say—  MISTRESS QUICKLY. Your worship says very true. I pray your worship come a little nearer this ways.  FALSTAFF. I warrant thee, nobody hears. Mine own people, mine own people.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. Are they so? God bless them, and make them His servants!  FALSTAFF. Well, Mistress Ford, what of her?  MISTRESS QUICKLY. Why, sir, she’s a good creature. Lord, Lord, your worship’s a wanton! Well, heaven forgive you, and all of us, I pray!  FALSTAFF. Mistress Ford, come, Mistress Ford.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. Marry, this is the short and the long of it: you have brought her into such a canaries as ’tis wonderful. The best courtier of them all, when the court lay at Windsor, could never have brought her to such a canary. Yet there has been knights, and lords, and gentlemen, with their coaches, I warrant you, coach after coach, letter after letter, gift after gift, smelling so sweetly, all musk, and so rushling, I warrant you, in silk and gold, and in such alligant terms, and in such wine and sugar of the best and the fairest, that would have won any woman’s heart; and I warrant you, they could never get an eye-wink of her. I had myself twenty angels given me this morning, but I defy all angels in any such sort, as they say, but in the way of honesty. And, I warrant you, they could never get her so much as sip on a cup with the proudest of them all. And yet there has been earls—nay, which is more, pensioners—but, I warrant you, all is one with her.  FALSTAFF. But what says she to me? Be brief, my good she-Mercury.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. Marry, she hath received your letter, for the which she thanks you a thousand times; and she gives you to notify that her husband will be absence from his house between ten and eleven.  FALSTAFF. Ten and eleven?  MISTRESS QUICKLY. Ay, forsooth; and then you may come and see the picture, she says, that you wot of. Master Ford, her husband, will be from home. Alas, the sweet woman leads an ill life with him. He’s a very jealousy man; she leads a very frampold life with him, good heart.  FALSTAFF. Ten and eleven. Woman, commend me to her; I will not fail her.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. Why, you say well. But I have another messenger to your worship. Mistress Page hath her hearty commendations to you too; and let me tell you in your ear, she’s as fartuous a civil modest wife, and one, I tell you, that will not miss you morning nor evening prayer, as any is in Windsor, whoe’er be the other; and she bade me tell your worship that her husband is seldom from home, but she hopes there will come a time. I never knew a woman so dote upon a man. Surely I think you have charms, la! Yes, in truth.  FALSTAFF. Not I, I assure thee. Setting the attraction of my good parts aside, I have no other charms.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. Blessing on your heart for ’t!  FALSTAFF. But, I pray thee, tell me this: has Ford’s wife and Page’s wife acquainted each other how they love me?  MISTRESS QUICKLY. That were a jest indeed! They have not so little grace, I hope. That were a trick indeed! But Mistress Page would desire you to send her your little page, of all loves. Her husband has a marvellous infection to the little page; and, truly, Master Page is an honest man. Never a wife in Windsor leads a better life than she does. Do what she will, say what she will, take all, pay all, go to bed when she list, rise when she list, all is as she will, and truly she deserves it, for if there be a kind woman in Windsor, she is one. You must send her your page, no remedy.  FALSTAFF. Why, I will.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. Nay, but do so then, and, look you, he may come and go between you both; and in any case have a nay-word, that you may know one another’s mind, and the boy never need to understand anything; for ’tis not good that children should know any wickedness. Old folks, you know, have discretion, as they say, and know the world.  FALSTAFF. Fare thee well, commend me to them both. There’s my purse; I am yet thy debtor. Boy, go along with this woman.—This news distracts me.  [_Exeunt Mistress Quickly and Robin._]  PISTOL. This punk is one of Cupid’s carriers; Clap on more sails, pursue; up with your fights; Give fire! She is my prize, or ocean whelm them all!  [_Exit Pistol._]  FALSTAFF. Sayst thou so, old Jack? Go thy ways, I’ll make more of thy old body than I have done. Will they yet look after thee? Wilt thou, after the expense of so much money, be now a gainer? Good body, I thank thee. Let them say ’tis grossly done; so it be fairly done, no matter.  Enter Bardolph with a cup of sack.  BARDOLPH Sir John, there’s one Master Brook below would fain speak with you and be acquainted with you, and hath sent your worship a morning’s draught of sack.  FALSTAFF. Brook is his name?  BARDOLPH. Ay, sir.  FALSTAFF. Call him in.  [_Exit Bardolph._]  Such Brooks are welcome to me, that o’erflow such liquor. Ah, ha, Mistress Ford and Mistress Page, have I encompassed you? Go to, _via!_  Enter Bardolph with Ford disguised as Brook.  FORD God bless you, sir.  FALSTAFF. And you, sir. Would you speak with me?  FORD. I make bold to press with so little preparation upon you.  FALSTAFF. You’re welcome. What’s your will?—Give us leave, drawer.  [_Exit Bardolph._]  FORD Sir, I am a gentleman that have spent much. My name is Brook.  FALSTAFF. Good Master Brook, I desire more acquaintance of you.  FORD. Good Sir John, I sue for yours; not to charge you, for I must let you understand I think myself in better plight for a lender than you are, the which hath something emboldened me to this unseasoned intrusion; for they say, if money go before, all ways do lie open.  FALSTAFF. Money is a good soldier, sir, and will on.  FORD. Troth, and I have a bag of money here troubles me. If you will help to bear it, Sir John, take all, or half, for easing me of the carriage.  FALSTAFF. Sir, I know not how I may deserve to be your porter.  FORD. I will tell you, sir, if you will give me the hearing.  FALSTAFF. Speak, good Master Brook. I shall be glad to be your servant.  FORD. Sir, I hear you are a scholar—I will be brief with you—and you have been a man long known to me, though I had never so good means as desire to make myself acquainted with you. I shall discover a thing to you, wherein I must very much lay open mine own imperfection. But, good Sir John, as you have one eye upon my follies, as you hear them unfolded, turn another into the register of your own, that I may pass with a reproof the easier, sith you yourself know how easy it is to be such an offender.  FALSTAFF. Very well, sir, proceed.  FORD. There is a gentlewoman in this town, her husband’s name is Ford.  FALSTAFF. Well, sir.  FORD. I have long loved her, and, I protest to you, bestowed much on her, followed her with a doting observance, engrossed opportunities to meet her, fee’d every slight occasion that could but niggardly give me sight of her, not only bought many presents to give her, but have given largely to many to know what she would have given. Briefly, I have pursued her as love hath pursued me, which hath been on the wing of all occasions. But whatsoever I have merited, either in my mind or in my means, meed, I am sure, I have received none, unless experience be a jewel. That I have purchased at an infinite rate, and that hath taught me to say this: Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues, Pursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues.  FALSTAFF. Have you received no promise of satisfaction at her hands?  FORD. Never.  FALSTAFF. Have you importuned her to such a purpose?  FORD. Never.  FALSTAFF. Of what quality was your love, then?  FORD. Like a fair house built on another man’s ground, so that I have lost my edifice by mistaking the place where I erected it.  FALSTAFF. To what purpose have you unfolded this to me?  FORD. When I have told you that, I have told you all. Some say that though she appear honest to me, yet in other places she enlargeth her mirth so far that there is shrewd construction made of her. Now, Sir John, here is the heart of my purpose: you are a gentleman of excellent breeding, admirable discourse, of great admittance, authentic in your place and person, generally allowed for your many warlike, courtlike, and learned preparations.  FALSTAFF. O, sir!  FORD. Believe it, for you know it. There is money. Spend it, spend it; spend more; spend all I have; only give me so much of your time in exchange of it as to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this Ford’s wife. Use your art of wooing, win her to consent to you. If any man may, you may as soon as any.  FALSTAFF. Would it apply well to the vehemency of your affection that I should win what you would enjoy? Methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously.  FORD. O, understand my drift. She dwells so securely on the excellency of her honour that the folly of my soul dares not present itself; she is too bright to be looked against. Now, could I come to her with any detection in my hand, my desires had instance and argument to commend themselves. I could drive her then from the ward of her purity, her reputation, her marriage vow, and a thousand other her defences, which now are too too strongly embattled against me. What say you to’t, Sir John?  FALSTAFF. Master Brook, I will first make bold with your money; next, give me your hand; and last, as I am a gentleman, you shall, if you will, enjoy Ford’s wife.  FORD. O good sir!  FALSTAFF. I say you shall.  FORD. Want no money, Sir John; you shall want none.  FALSTAFF. Want no Mistress Ford, Master Brook; you shall want none. I shall be with her, I may tell you, by her own appointment; even as you came in to me, her assistant or go-between parted from me. I say I shall be with her between ten and eleven, for at that time the jealous rascally knave her husband will be forth. Come you to me at night. You shall know how I speed.  FORD. I am blessed in your acquaintance. Do you know Ford, sir?  FALSTAFF. Hang him, poor cuckoldly knave! I know him not. Yet I wrong him to call him poor. They say the jealous wittolly knave hath masses of money, for the which his wife seems to me well-favoured. I will use her as the key of the cuckoldly rogue’s coffer, and there’s my harvest-home.  FORD. I would you knew Ford, sir, that you might avoid him if you saw him.  FALSTAFF. Hang him, mechanical salt-butter rogue! I will stare him out of his wits, I will awe him with my cudgel; it shall hang like a meteor o’er the cuckold’s horns. Master Brook, thou shalt know I will predominate over the peasant, and thou shalt lie with his wife. Come to me soon at night. Ford’s a knave, and I will aggravate his style. Thou, Master Brook, shalt know him for knave and cuckold. Come to me soon at night.  [_Exit Falstaff._]  FORD. What a damned epicurean rascal is this! My heart is ready to crack with impatience. Who says this is improvident jealousy? My wife hath sent to him, the hour is fixed, the match is made. Would any man have thought this? See the hell of having a false woman: my bed shall be abused, my coffers ransacked, my reputation gnawn at; and I shall not only receive this villanous wrong, but stand under the adoption of abominable terms, and by him that does me this wrong. Terms, names! Amaimon sounds well; Lucifer, well; Barbason, well; yet they are devils’ additions, the names of fiends. But cuckold? Wittol? Cuckold? The devil himself hath not such a name. Page is an ass, a secure ass; he will trust his wife, he will not be jealous. I will rather trust a Fleming with my butter, Parson Hugh the Welshman with my cheese, an Irishman with my aqua-vitae bottle, or a thief to walk my ambling gelding, than my wife with herself. Then she plots, then she ruminates, then she devises; and what they think in their hearts they may effect, they will break their hearts but they will effect. God be praised for my jealousy! Eleven o’clock the hour. I will prevent this, detect my wife, be revenged on Falstaff, and laugh at Page. I will about it. Better three hours too soon than a minute too late. Fie, fie, fie! Cuckold, cuckold, cuckold!  [_Exit._]  SCENE III. A field near Windsor  Enter Doctor Caius and Rugby.  CAIUS. Jack Rugby!  RUGBY. Sir?  CAIUS. Vat is de clock, Jack?  RUGBY. ’Tis past the hour, sir, that Sir Hugh promised to meet.  CAIUS. By gar, he has save his soul, dat he is no come. He has pray his Pible well dat he is no come. By gar, Jack Rugby, he is dead already, if he be come.  RUGBY. He is wise, sir; he knew your worship would kill him if he came.  CAIUS. By gar, de herring is no dead so as I vill kill him. Take your rapier, Jack; I vill tell you how I vill kill him.  RUGBY. Alas, sir, I cannot fence.  CAIUS. Villainy, take your rapier.  RUGBY. Forbear; here’s company.  Enter Page, Shallow, Slender and Host.  HOST God bless thee, bully doctor!  SHALLOW. God save you, Master Doctor Caius!  PAGE. Now, good Master Doctor!  SLENDER. Give you good morrow, sir.  CAIUS. Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?  HOST. To see thee fight, to see thee foin, to see thee traverse; to see thee here, to see thee there; to see thee pass thy punto, thy stock, thy reverse, thy distance, thy montant. Is he dead, my Ethiopian? Is he dead, my Francisco? Ha, bully? What says my Aesculapius, my Galen, my heart of elder, ha? Is he dead, bully stale? Is he dead?  CAIUS. By gar, he is de coward Jack-priest of de vorld. He is not show his face.  HOST. Thou art a Castalion King Urinal Hector of Greece, my boy!  CAIUS. I pray you, bear witness that me have stay six or seven, two, tree hours for him, and he is no come.  SHALLOW. He is the wiser man, Master doctor. He is a curer of souls, and you a curer of bodies. If you should fight, you go against the hair of your professions. Is it not true, Master Page?  PAGE. Master Shallow, you have yourself been a great fighter, though now a man of peace.  SHALLOW. Bodykins, Master Page, though I now be old, and of the peace, if I see a sword out, my finger itches to make one. Though we are justices and doctors and churchmen, Master Page, we have some salt of our youth in us. We are the sons of women, Master Page.  PAGE. ’Tis true, Master Shallow.  SHALLOW. It will be found so, Master Page.—Master Doctor Caius, I come to fetch you home. I am sworn of the peace. You have showed yourself a wise physician, and Sir Hugh hath shown himself a wise and patient churchman. You must go with me, Master Doctor.  HOST. Pardon, guest justice.—A word, Monsieur Mockwater.  CAIUS. Mockvater? Vat is dat?  HOST. Mockwater, in our English tongue, is valour, bully.  CAIUS. By gar, then I have as much mockvater as de Englishman. Scurvy jack-dog priest! By gar, me vill cut his ears.  HOST. He will clapper-claw thee tightly, bully.  CAIUS. Clapper-de-claw? Vat is dat?  HOST. That is, he will make thee amends.  CAIUS. By gar, me do look he shall clapper-de-claw me, for, by gar, me vill have it.  HOST. And I will provoke him to’t, or let him wag.  CAIUS. Me tank you for dat.  HOST. And, moreover, bully—but first, Master guest, and Master Page, and eke Cavaliero Slender, go you through the town to Frogmore.  PAGE [_Aside to Host_.] Sir Hugh is there, is he?  HOST. [_Aside to Page_.] He is there. See what humour he is in; and I will bring the doctor about by the fields. Will it do well?  SHALLOW. [_Aside to Host_.] We will do it.  PAGE, SHALLOW and SLENDER Adieu, good Master Doctor.  [_Exeunt Page, Shallow and Slender._]  CAIUS By gar, me vill kill de priest, for he speak for a jackanape to Anne Page.  HOST. Let him die. Sheathe thy impatience; throw cold water on thy choler. Go about the fields with me through Frogmore. I will bring thee where Mistress Anne Page is, at a farm-house a-feasting, and thou shalt woo her. Cried game! Said I well?  CAIUS. By gar, me tank you for dat. By gar, I love you; and I shall procure-a you de good guest: de earl, de knight, de lords, de gentlemen, my patients.  HOST. For the which I will be thy adversary toward Anne Page. Said I well?  CAIUS. By gar, ’tis good; vell said.  HOST. Let us wag, then.  CAIUS. Come at my heels, Jack Rugby.  [_Exeunt._]
  ACT III  SCENE I. A field near Frogmore
Enter Sir Hugh Evans and Simple.  EVANS. I pray you now, good Master Slender’s servingman, and friend Simple by your name, which way have you looked for Master Caius, that calls himself doctor of physic?  SIMPLE. Marry, sir, the Petty-ward, the Park-ward, every way; old Windsor way, and every way but the town way.  EVANS. I most fehemently desire you, you will also look that way.  SIMPLE. I will, Sir.  [_Exit Simple._]  EVANS Pless my soul, how full of cholers I am, and trempling of mind! I shall be glad if he have deceived me. How melancholies I am! I will knog his urinals about his knave’s costard when I have good opportunities for the ’ork. Pless my soul!  [_Sings._]  _To shallow rivers, to whose falls Melodious birds sings madrigals. There will we make our peds of roses And a thousand fragrant posies. To shallow_—  Mercy on me, I have a great dispositions to cry.  [_Sings._]  _Melodious birds sing madrigals— Whenas I sat in Pabylon— And a thousand vagram posies. To shallow rivers, to whose falls Melodious birds sing madrigals._  Enter Simple.  SIMPLE Yonder he is, coming this way, Sir Hugh.  EVANS. He’s welcome.  [_Sings._] _To shallow rivers, to whose falls—_ Heaven prosper the right! What weapons is he?  SIMPLE. No weapons, sir. There comes my master, Master Shallow, and another gentleman, from Frogmore, over the stile, this way.  EVANS. Pray you, give me my gown—or else keep it in your arms.  Enter Page, Shallow and Slender.  SHALLOW How now, Master Parson? Good morrow, good Sir Hugh. Keep a gamester from the dice, and a good student from his book, and it is wonderful.  SLENDER. [_Aside_.] Ah, sweet Anne Page!  PAGE. God save you, good Sir Hugh!  EVANS. God pless you from his mercy sake, all of you!  SHALLOW. What, the sword and the word? Do you study them both, Master Parson?  PAGE. And youthful still—in your doublet and hose, this raw rheumatic day?  EVANS. There is reasons and causes for it.  PAGE. We are come to you to do a good office, Master Parson.  EVANS. Fery well; what is it?  PAGE. Yonder is a most reverend gentleman who, belike having received wrong by some person, is at most odds with his own gravity and patience that ever you saw.  SHALLOW. I have lived fourscore years and upward; I never heard a man of his place, gravity, and learning, so wide of his own respect.  EVANS. What is he?  PAGE. I think you know him: Master Doctor Caius, the renowned French physician.  EVANS. Got’s will and His passion of my heart! I had as lief you would tell me of a mess of porridge.  PAGE. Why?  EVANS. He has no more knowledge in Hibbocrates and Galen, and he is a knave besides, a cowardly knave as you would desires to be acquainted withal.  PAGE. I warrant you, he’s the man should fight with him.  SLENDER. [_Aside_.] O, sweet Anne Page!  SHALLOW. It appears so by his weapons. Keep them asunder. Here comes Doctor Caius.  Enter Host, Caius and Rugby.  PAGE Nay, good Master Parson, keep in your weapon.  SHALLOW. So do you, good Master Doctor.  HOST. Disarm them, and let them question. Let them keep their limbs whole and hack our English.  CAIUS. I pray you, let-a me speak a word with your ear. Verefore will you not meet-a me?  EVANS. [_Aside to Caius_.] Pray you, use your patience. In good time.  CAIUS. By gar, you are de coward, de Jack dog, John ape.  EVANS. [_Aside to Caius_.] Pray you, let us not be laughing stocks to other men’s humours. I desire you in friendship, and I will one way or other make you amends. [_Aloud_.] By Jeshu, I will knog your urinal about your knave’s cogscomb.  CAIUS. _Diable!_ Jack Rugby, mine Host de Jarteer, have I not stay for him to kill him? Have I not, at de place I did appoint?  EVANS. As I am a Christians soul, now look you, this is the place appointed. I’ll be judgment by mine host of the Garter.  HOST. Peace, I say, Gallia and Gaul, French and Welsh, soul-curer and body-curer!  CAIUS. Ay, dat is very good; excellent.  HOST. Peace, I say! Hear mine host of the Garter. Am I politic? Am I subtle? Am I a Machiavel? Shall I lose my doctor? No, he gives me the potions and the motions. Shall I lose my parson, my priest, my Sir Hugh? No, he gives me the proverbs and the no-verbs. [_To Caius_.] Give me thy hand, terrestrial; so. [_To Evans_.] Give me thy hand, celestial; so. Boys of art, I have deceived you both. I have directed you to wrong places. Your hearts are mighty, your skins are whole, and let burnt sack be the issue. Come, lay their swords to pawn. Follow me, lads of peace, follow, follow, follow.  [_Exit Host._]  SHALLOW. Afore God, a mad host! Follow, gentlemen, follow.  SLENDER. [_Aside_.] O, sweet Anne Page!  [_Exeunt Shallow, Slender and Page._]  CAIUS Ha, do I perceive dat? Have you make-a de sot of us, ha, ha?  EVANS. This is well, he has made us his vlouting-stog. I desire you that we may be friends, and let us knog our prains together to be revenge on this same scall, scurvy, cogging companion, the host of the Garter.  CAIUS. By gar, with all my heart. He promise to bring me where is Anne Page; by gar, he deceive me too.  EVANS. Well, I will smite his noddles. Pray you follow.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. A street in Windsor  Enter Mistress Page following Robin.  MISTRESS PAGE. Nay, keep your way, little gallant. You were wont to be a follower, but now you are a leader. Whether had you rather, lead mine eyes, or eye your master’s heels?  ROBIN. I had rather, forsooth, go before you like a man than follow him like a dwarf.  MISTRESS PAGE. O, you are a flattering boy! Now I see you’ll be a courtier.  Enter Ford.  FORD Well met, Mistress Page. Whither go you?  MISTRESS PAGE. Truly, sir, to see your wife. Is she at home?  FORD. Ay, and as idle as she may hang together, for want of company. I think if your husbands were dead you two would marry.  MISTRESS PAGE. Be sure of that—two other husbands.  FORD. Where had you this pretty weathercock?  MISTRESS PAGE. I cannot tell what the dickens his name is my husband had him of. What do you call your knight’s name, sirrah?  ROBIN. Sir John Falstaff.  FORD. Sir John Falstaff!  MISTRESS PAGE. He, he; I can never hit on’s name. There is such a league between my good man and he! Is your wife at home indeed?  FORD. Indeed she is.  MISTRESS PAGE. By your leave, sir, I am sick till I see her.  [_Exeunt Mistress Page and Robin._]  FORD Has Page any brains? Hath he any eyes? Hath he any thinking? Sure, they sleep; he hath no use of them. Why, this boy will carry a letter twenty mile as easy as a cannon will shoot point-blank twelve score. He pieces out his wife’s inclination, he gives her folly motion and advantage. And now she’s going to my wife, and Falstaff’s boy with her. A man may hear this shower sing in the wind. And Falstaff’s boy with her! Good plots they are laid, and our revolted wives share damnation together. Well, I will take him, then torture my wife, pluck the borrowed veil of modesty from the so-seeming Mistress Page, divulge Page himself for a secure and wilful Actaeon, and to these violent proceedings all my neighbours shall cry aim. [_Clock strikes_.] The clock gives me my cue, and my assurance bids me search. There I shall find Falstaff. I shall be rather praised for this than mocked, for it is as positive as the earth is firm that Falstaff is there. I will go.  Enter Page, Shallow, Slender, Host, Sir Hugh Evans, Caius and Rugby.  SHALLOW, PAGE, etc. Well met, Master Ford.  FORD. Trust me, a good knot. I have good cheer at home, and I pray you all go with me.  SHALLOW. I must excuse myself, Master Ford.  SLENDER. And so must I, sir; we have appointed to dine with Mistress Anne, and I would not break with her for more money than I’ll speak of.  SHALLOW. We have lingered about a match between Anne Page and my cousin Slender, and this day we shall have our answer.  SLENDER. I hope I have your good will, father Page.  PAGE. You have, Master Slender, I stand wholly for you.—But my wife, Master doctor, is for you altogether.  CAIUS. Ay, be-gar; and de maid is love-a me! My nursh-a Quickly tell me so mush.  HOST. What say you to young Master Fenton? He capers, he dances, he has eyes of youth, he writes verses, he speaks holiday, he smells April and May. He will carry ’t, he will carry ’t. ’Tis in his buttons he will carry ’t.  PAGE. Not by my consent, I promise you. The gentleman is of no having. He kept company with the wild Prince and Poins. He is of too high a region, he knows too much. No, he shall not knit a knot in his fortunes with the finger of my substance. If he take her, let him take her simply. The wealth I have waits on my consent, and my consent goes not that way.  FORD. I beseech you, heartily, some of you go home with me to dinner. Besides your cheer, you shall have sport: I will show you a monster. Master Doctor, you shall go; so shall you, Master Page, and you, Sir Hugh.  SHALLOW. Well, fare you well. We shall have the freer wooing at Master Page’s.  [_Exeunt Shallow and Slender._]  CAIUS Go home, John Rugby; I come anon.  [_Exit Rugby._]  HOST Farewell, my hearts. I will to my honest knight Falstaff, and drink canary with him.  [_Exit Host._]  FORD [_Aside_.] I think I shall drink in pipe-wine first with him; I’ll make him dance.—Will you go, gentles?  ALL. Have with you to see this monster.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. A room in Ford’s house  Enter Mistress Ford and Mistress Page.  MISTRESS FORD. What, John! What, Robert!  MISTRESS PAGE. Quickly, quickly! Is the buck-basket—  MISTRESS FORD. I warrant.—What, Robin, I say!  Enter John and Robert with a great buck-basket.  MISTRESS PAGE. Come, come, come.  MISTRESS FORD. Here, set it down.  MISTRESS PAGE. Give your men the charge; we must be brief.  MISTRESS FORD. Marry, as I told you before, John and Robert, be ready here hard by in the brew-house; and when I suddenly call you, come forth, and, without any pause or staggering, take this basket on your shoulders. That done, trudge with it in all haste, and carry it among the whitsters in Datchet Mead, and there empty it in the muddy ditch close by the Thames side.  MISTRESS PAGE. You will do it?  MISTRESS FORD. I ha’ told them over and over, they lack no direction.—Be gone, and come when you are called.  [_Exeunt John and Robert._]  MISTRESS PAGE. Here comes little Robin.  Enter Robin.  MISTRESS FORD. How now, my eyas-musket, what news with you?  ROBIN. My Master, Sir John, is come in at your back door, Mistress Ford, and requests your company.  MISTRESS PAGE. You little Jack-a-Lent, have you been true to us?  ROBIN. Ay, I’ll be sworn. My master knows not of your being here, and hath threatened to put me into everlasting liberty if I tell you of it; for he swears he’ll turn me away.  MISTRESS PAGE. Thou’rt a good boy, this secrecy of thine shall be a tailor to thee, and shall make thee a new doublet and hose. I’ll go hide me.  MISTRESS FORD. Do so.—Go tell thy master I am alone.  [_Exit Robin._]  Mistress Page, remember you your cue.  MISTRESS PAGE. I warrant thee. If I do not act it, hiss me.  [_Exit Mistress Page._]  MISTRESS FORD. Go to, then. We’ll use this unwholesome humidity, this gross watery pumpion; we’ll teach him to know turtles from jays.  Enter Falstaff.  FALSTAFF. “Have I caught thee, my heavenly jewel?” Why, now let me die, for I have lived long enough. This is the period of my ambition. O this blessed hour!  MISTRESS FORD. O, sweet Sir John!  FALSTAFF. Mistress Ford, I cannot cog, I cannot prate, Mistress Ford. Now shall I sin in my wish: I would thy husband were dead. I’ll speak it before the best lord: I would make thee my lady.  MISTRESS FORD. I your lady, Sir John? Alas, I should be a pitiful lady.  FALSTAFF. Let the court of France show me such another. I see how thine eye would emulate the diamond. Thou hast the right arched beauty of the brow that becomes the ship-tire, the tire-valiant, or any tire of Venetian admittance.  MISTRESS FORD. A plain kerchief, Sir John. My brows become nothing else, nor that well neither.  FALSTAFF. By the Lord, thou art a traitor to say so. Thou wouldst make an absolute courtier, and the firm fixture of thy foot would give an excellent motion to thy gait in a semi-circled farthingale. I see what thou wert, if Fortune thy foe were not, Nature thy friend. Come, thou canst not hide it.  MISTRESS FORD. Believe me, there’s no such thing in me.  FALSTAFF. What made me love thee? Let that persuade thee there’s something extraordinary in thee. Come, I cannot cog and say thou art this and that, like a many of these lisping hawthorn buds that come like women in men’s apparel, and smell like Bucklersbury in simple-time. I cannot. But I love thee, none but thee; and thou deservest it.  MISTRESS FORD. Do not betray me, sir; I fear you love Mistress Page.  FALSTAFF. Thou mightst as well say I love to walk by the Counter gate, which is as hateful to me as the reek of a lime-kiln.  MISTRESS FORD. Well, heaven knows how I love you, and you shall one day find it.  FALSTAFF. Keep in that mind, I’ll deserve it.  MISTRESS FORD. Nay, I must tell you, so you do; or else I could not be in that mind.  Enter Robin.  ROBIN. Mistress Ford, Mistress Ford, here’s Mistress Page at the door, sweating and blowing and looking wildly, and would needs speak with you presently.  FALSTAFF. She shall not see me; I will ensconce me behind the arras.  MISTRESS FORD. Pray you, do so; she’s a very tattling woman.  [_Falstaff hides himself behind the arras._]  Enter Mistress Page.  What’s the matter? How now?  MISTRESS PAGE. O Mistress Ford, what have you done? You’re shamed, you’re overthrown, you’re undone for ever!  MISTRESS FORD. What’s the matter, good Mistress Page?  MISTRESS PAGE. O well-a-day, Mistress Ford, having an honest man to your husband, to give him such cause of suspicion!  MISTRESS FORD. What cause of suspicion?  MISTRESS PAGE. What cause of suspicion? Out upon you! How am I mistook in you!  MISTRESS FORD. Why, alas, what’s the matter?  MISTRESS PAGE. Your husband’s coming hither, woman, with all the officers in Windsor, to search for a gentleman that he says is here now in the house, by your consent, to take an ill advantage of his absence. You are undone.  MISTRESS FORD. ’Tis not so, I hope.  MISTRESS PAGE. Pray heaven it be not so, that you have such a man here! But ’tis most certain your husband’s coming, with half Windsor at his heels, to search for such a one. I come before to tell you. If you know yourself clear, why, I am glad of it; but if you have a friend here, convey, convey him out. Be not amazed, call all your senses to you; defend your reputation, or bid farewell to your good life for ever.  MISTRESS FORD. What shall I do? There is a gentleman, my dear friend; and I fear not mine own shame as much as his peril. I had rather than a thousand pound he were out of the house.  MISTRESS PAGE. For shame! Never stand “you had rather” and “you had rather”. Your husband’s here at hand. Bethink you of some conveyance. In the house you cannot hide him. O, how have you deceived me! Look, here is a basket. If he be of any reasonable stature, he may creep in here; and throw foul linen upon him, as if it were going to bucking. Or—it is whiting-time—send him by your two men to Datchet Mead.  MISTRESS FORD. He’s too big to go in there. What shall I do?  FALSTAFF. [_Comes out of hiding_.] Let me see ’t, let me see ’t! O, let me see ’t! I’ll in, I’ll in. Follow your friend’s counsel. I’ll in.  MISTRESS PAGE. What, Sir John Falstaff? Are these your letters, knight?  FALSTAFF. I love thee, and none but thee. Help me away. Let me creep in here. I’ll never—  [_He goes into the basket; they cover him with dirty clothes._]  MISTRESS PAGE. Help to cover your master, boy.—Call your men, Mistress Ford.—You dissembling knight!  [_Exit Robin._]  MISTRESS FORD. What, John! Robert! John!  Enter John and Robert.  Go, take up these clothes here, quickly. Where’s the cowl-staff? Look how you drumble! Carry them to the laundress in Datchet Mead; quickly, come.  Enter Ford, Page, Caius and Sir Hugh Evans.  FORD. Pray you come near. If I suspect without cause, why then make sport at me, then let me be your jest; I deserve it.—How now? Whither bear you this?  JOHN and ROBERT. To the laundress, forsooth.  MISTRESS FORD. Why, what have you to do whither they bear it? You were best meddle with buck-washing!  FORD. Buck? I would I could wash myself of the buck! Buck, buck, buck! Ay, buck! I warrant you, buck, and of the season too, it shall appear.  [_Exeunt John and Robert with the basket._]  Gentlemen, I have dreamed tonight; I’ll tell you my dream. Here, here, here be my keys. Ascend my chambers, search, seek, find out. I’ll warrant we’ll unkennel the fox. Let me stop this way first. [_Locks the door_.] So, now uncape.  PAGE. Good Master Ford, be contented: you wrong yourself too much.  FORD. True, Master Page.—Up, gentlemen, you shall see sport anon. Follow me, gentlemen.  [_Exit Ford._]  EVANS This is fery fantastical humours and jealousies.  CAIUS. By gar, ’tis no the fashion of France; it is not jealous in France.  PAGE. Nay, follow him, gentlemen; see the issue of his search.  [_Exeunt Page, Evans and Caius._]  MISTRESS PAGE. Is there not a double excellency in this?  MISTRESS FORD. I know not which pleases me better, that my husband is deceived, or Sir John.  MISTRESS PAGE. What a taking was he in when your husband asked who was in the basket!  MISTRESS FORD. I am half afraid he will have need of washing, so throwing him into the water will do him a benefit.  MISTRESS PAGE. Hang him, dishonest rascal! I would all of the same strain were in the same distress.  MISTRESS FORD. I think my husband hath some special suspicion of Falstaff’s being here, for I never saw him so gross in his jealousy till now.  MISTRESS PAGE. I will lay a plot to try that, and we will yet have more tricks with Falstaff. His dissolute disease will scarce obey this medicine.  MISTRESS FORD. Shall we send that foolish carrion Mistress Quickly to him, and excuse his throwing into the water, and give him another hope, to betray him to another punishment?  MISTRESS PAGE. We will do it. Let him be sent for tomorrow eight o’clock to have amends.  Enter Ford, Page, Caius and Sir Hugh Evans.  FORD I cannot find him. Maybe the knave bragged of that he could not compass.  MISTRESS PAGE. [_Aside to Mistress Ford_.] Heard you that?  MISTRESS FORD. You use me well, Master Ford, do you?  FORD. Ay, I do so.  MISTRESS FORD. Heaven make you better than your thoughts!  FORD. Amen!  MISTRESS PAGE. You do yourself mighty wrong, Master Ford.  FORD. Ay, ay; I must bear it.  EVANS. If there be anypody in the house, and in the chambers, and in the coffers, and in the presses, heaven forgive my sins at the day of judgment!  CAIUS. Be gar, nor I too; there is nobodies.  PAGE. Fie, fie, Master Ford, are you not ashamed? What spirit, what devil suggests this imagination? I would not ha’ your distemper in this kind for the wealth of Windsor Castle.  FORD. ’Tis my fault, Master Page. I suffer for it.  EVANS. You suffer for a pad conscience. Your wife is as honest a ’omans as I will desires among five thousand, and five hundred too.  CAIUS. By gar, I see ’tis an honest woman.  FORD. Well, I promised you a dinner. Come, come, walk in the park. I pray you pardon me; I will hereafter make known to you why I have done this. Come, wife, come, Mistress Page, I pray you pardon me. Pray heartily, pardon me.  PAGE. Let’s go in, gentlemen; but, trust me, we’ll mock him. I do invite you tomorrow morning to my house to breakfast; after, we’ll a-birding together; I have a fine hawk for the bush. Shall it be so?  FORD. Anything.  EVANS. If there is one, I shall make two in the company.  CAIUS. If there be one or two, I shall make-a the turd.  FORD. Pray you go, Master Page.  [_Exeunt all but Evans and Caius._]  EVANS. I pray you now, remembrance tomorrow on the lousy knave, mine host.  CAIUS. Dat is good, by gar, with all my heart.  EVANS. A lousy knave, to have his gibes and his mockeries!  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IV. A room in Page’s house  Enter Fenton and Anne Page.  FENTON. I see I cannot get thy father’s love; Therefore no more turn me to him, sweet Nan.  ANNE. Alas, how then?  FENTON. Why, thou must be thyself. He doth object I am too great of birth, And that my state being galled with my expense, I seek to heal it only by his wealth. Besides these, other bars he lays before me: My riots past, my wild societies— And tells me ’tis a thing impossible I should love thee but as a property.  ANNE. Maybe he tells you true.  FENTON. No, heaven so speed me in my time to come! Albeit I will confess thy father’s wealth Was the first motive that I wooed thee, Anne, Yet, wooing thee, I found thee of more value Than stamps in gold or sums in sealed bags. And ’tis the very riches of thyself That now I aim at.  ANNE. Gentle Master Fenton, Yet seek my father’s love, still seek it, sir. If opportunity and humblest suit Cannot attain it, why then—hark you hither.  [_They talk apart._]  Enter Shallow, Slender and Mistress Quickly.  SHALLOW. Break their talk, Mistress Quickly. My kinsman shall speak for himself.  SLENDER. I’ll make a shaft or a bolt on ’t. ’Slid, ’tis but venturing.  SHALLOW. Be not dismayed.  SLENDER. No, she shall not dismay me. I care not for that, but that I am afeard.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. Hark ye, Master Slender would speak a word with you.  ANNE. I come to him. [_Aside_.] This is my father’s choice. O, what a world of vile ill-favoured faults Looks handsome in three hundred pounds a year!  MISTRESS QUICKLY. And how does good Master Fenton? Pray you, a word with you.  [_They talk aside._]  SHALLOW. [_To Slender_.] She’s coming; to her, coz. O boy, thou hadst a father!  SLENDER. I had a father, Mistress Anne; my uncle can tell you good jests of him.—Pray you, uncle, tell Mistress Anne the jest how my father stole two geese out of a pen, good uncle.  SHALLOW. Mistress Anne, my cousin loves you.  SLENDER. Ay, that I do, as well as I love any woman in Gloucestershire.  SHALLOW. He will maintain you like a gentlewoman.  SLENDER. Ay, that I will, come cut and long-tail, under the degree of a squire.  SHALLOW. He will make you a hundred and fifty pounds jointure.  ANNE. Good Master Shallow, let him woo for himself.  SHALLOW. Marry, I thank you for it, I thank you for that good comfort.—She calls you, coz; I’ll leave you.  ANNE. Now, Master Slender.  SLENDER. Now, good Mistress Anne.  ANNE. What is your will?  SLENDER. My will? ’Od’s heartlings, that’s a pretty jest indeed! I ne’er made my will yet, I thank heaven. I am not such a sickly creature, I give heaven praise.  ANNE. I mean, Master Slender, what would you with me?  SLENDER. Truly, for mine own part I would little or nothing with you. Your father and my uncle hath made motions. If it be my luck, so; if not, happy man be his dole. They can tell you how things go better than I can. You may ask your father. Here he comes.  Enter Page and Mistress Page.  PAGE Now, Master Slender.—Love him, daughter Anne.— Why, how now? What does Master Fenton here? You wrong me, sir, thus still to haunt my house. I told you, sir, my daughter is disposed of.  FENTON. Nay, Master Page, be not impatient.  MISTRESS PAGE. Good Master Fenton, come not to my child.  PAGE. She is no match for you.  FENTON. Sir, will you hear me?  PAGE. No, good Master Fenton.— Come, Master Shallow; come, son Slender, in.— Knowing my mind, you wrong me, Master Fenton.  [_Exeunt Page, Shallow and Slender._]  MISTRESS QUICKLY. Speak to Mistress Page.  FENTON. Good Mistress Page, for that I love your daughter In such a righteous fashion as I do, Perforce, against all checks, rebukes, and manners, I must advance the colours of my love And not retire. Let me have your good will.  ANNE. Good mother, do not marry me to yond fool.  MISTRESS PAGE. I mean it not; I seek you a better husband.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. That’s my master, Master Doctor.  ANNE. Alas, I had rather be set quick i’ th’ earth, And bowled to death with turnips.  MISTRESS PAGE. Come, trouble not yourself, good Master Fenton, I will not be your friend, nor enemy. My daughter will I question how she loves you, And as I find her, so am I affected. Till then, farewell, sir. She must needs go in; Her father will be angry.  FENTON. Farewell, gentle mistress. Farewell, Nan.  [_Exeunt Mistress Page and Anne._]  MISTRESS QUICKLY. This is my doing now. “Nay,” said I, “will you cast away your child on a fool, and a physician? Look on Master Fenton.” This is my doing.  FENTON. I thank thee; and I pray thee, once tonight Give my sweet Nan this ring. There’s for thy pains.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. Now Heaven send thee good fortune!  [_Exit Fenton._]  A kind heart he hath. A woman would run through fire and water for such a kind heart. But yet I would my master had Mistress Anne, or I would Master Slender had her; or, in sooth, I would Master Fenton had her. I will do what I can for them all three, for so I have promised and I’ll be as good as my word—but speciously for Master Fenton. Well, I must of another errand to Sir John Falstaff from my two mistresses. What a beast am I to slack it!  [_Exit._]  SCENE V. A room in the Garter Inn  Enter Falstaff.  FALSTAFF. Bardolph, I say!  Enter Bardolph.  BARDOLPH. Here, sir.  FALSTAFF. Go fetch me a quart of sack; put a toast in ’t.  [_Exit Bardolph._]  Have I lived to be carried in a basket like a barrow of butcher’s offal, and to be thrown in the Thames? Well, if I be served such another trick, I’ll have my brains ta’en out and buttered, and give them to a dog for a New Year’s gift. ’Sblood, the rogues slighted me into the river with as little remorse as they would have drowned a blind bitch’s puppies, fifteen i’ the litter; and you may know by my size that I have a kind of alacrity in sinking; if the bottom were as deep as hell, I should down. I had been drowned, but that the shore was shelvy and shallow—a death that I abhor, for the water swells a man, and what a thing should I have been when I had been swelled! I should have been a mountain of mummy.  Enter Bardolph with sack.  BARDOLPH Here’s Mistress Quickly, sir, to speak with you.  FALSTAFF. Come, let me pour in some sack to the Thames water, for my belly’s as cold as if I had swallowed snowballs for pills to cool the reins. Call her in.  BARDOLPH. Come in, woman.  Enter Mistress Quickly.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. By your leave, I cry you mercy. Give your worship good morrow.  FALSTAFF. Take away these chalices. Go, brew me a pottle of sack finely.  BARDOLPH. With eggs, sir?  FALSTAFF. Simple of itself. I’ll no pullet sperm in my brewage.  [_Exit Bardolph._]  How now?  MISTRESS QUICKLY. Marry, sir, I come to your worship from Mistress Ford.  FALSTAFF. Mistress Ford? I have had ford enough. I was thrown into the ford, I have my belly full of ford.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. Alas the day, good heart, that was not her fault. She does so take on with her men; they mistook their erection.  FALSTAFF. So did I mine, to build upon a foolish woman’s promise.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. Well, she laments, sir, for it, that it would yearn your heart to see it. Her husband goes this morning a-birding; she desires you once more to come to her, between eight and nine. I must carry her word quickly. She’ll make you amends, I warrant you.  FALSTAFF. Well, I will visit her. Tell her so, and bid her think what a man is. Let her consider his frailty, and then judge of my merit.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. I will tell her.  FALSTAFF. Do so. Between nine and ten, sayst thou?  MISTRESS QUICKLY. Eight and nine, sir.  FALSTAFF. Well, be gone. I will not miss her.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. Peace be with you, sir.  [_Exit Mistress Quickly._]  FALSTAFF. I marvel I hear not of Master Brook; he sent me word to stay within. I like his money well. O, here he comes.  Enter Ford disguised.  FORD God bless you, sir.  FALSTAFF. Now, Master Brook, you come to know what hath passed between me and Ford’s wife?  FORD. That indeed, Sir John, is my business.  FALSTAFF. Master Brook, I will not lie to you. I was at her house the hour she appointed me.  FORD. And how sped you, sir?  FALSTAFF. Very ill-favouredly, Master Brook.  FORD. How so, sir? Did she change her determination?  FALSTAFF. No. Master Brook, but the peaking cornuto her husband, Master Brook, dwelling in a continual ’larum of jealousy, comes me in the instant of our encounter, after we had embraced, kissed, protested, and, as it were, spoke the prologue of our comedy; and at his heels a rabble of his companions, thither provoked and instigated by his distemper, and, forsooth, to search his house for his wife’s love.  FORD. What, while you were there?  FALSTAFF. While I was there.  FORD. And did he search for you, and could not find you?  FALSTAFF. You shall hear. As good luck would have it, comes in one Mistress Page, gives intelligence of Ford’s approach; and, in her invention and Ford’s wife’s distraction, they conveyed me into a buck-basket.  FORD. A buck-basket!  FALSTAFF. By the Lord, a buck-basket! Rammed me in with foul shirts and smocks, socks, foul stockings, greasy napkins, that, Master Brook, there was the rankest compound of villainous smell that ever offended nostril.  FORD. And how long lay you there?  FALSTAFF. Nay, you shall hear, Master Brook, what I have suffered to bring this woman to evil for your good. Being thus crammed in the basket, a couple of Ford’s knaves, his hinds, were called forth by their mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to Datchet Lane. They took me on their shoulders, met the jealous knave their master in the door, who asked them once or twice what they had in their basket. I quaked for fear lest the lunatic knave would have searched it; but Fate, ordaining he should be a cuckold, held his hand. Well, on went he for a search, and away went I for foul clothes. But mark the sequel, Master Brook. I suffered the pangs of three several deaths: first, an intolerable fright to be detected with a jealous rotten bell-wether; next, to be compassed like a good bilbo in the circumference of a peck, hilt to point, heel to head; and then, to be stopped in, like a strong distillation, with stinking clothes that fretted in their own grease. Think of that, a man of my kidney, think of that—that am as subject to heat as butter; a man of continual dissolution and thaw. It was a miracle to ’scape suffocation. And in the height of this bath, when I was more than half stewed in grease, like a Dutch dish, to be thrown into the Thames and cooled, glowing hot, in that surge, like a horseshoe! Think of that—hissing hot—think of that, Master Brook.  FORD. In good sadness, sir, I am sorry that for my sake you have suffered all this. My suit, then, is desperate. You’ll undertake her no more?  FALSTAFF. Master Brook, I will be thrown into Etna, as I have been into Thames, ere I will leave her thus. Her husband is this morning gone a-birding; I have received from her another embassy of meeting. ’Twixt eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.  FORD. ’Tis past eight already, sir.  FALSTAFF. Is it? I will then address me to my appointment. Come to me at your convenient leisure, and you shall know how I speed; and the conclusion shall be crowned with your enjoying her. Adieu. You shall have her, Master Brook. Master Brook, you shall cuckold Ford.  [_Exit Falstaff._]  FORD Hum! Ha! Is this a vision? Is this a dream? Do I sleep? Master Ford, awake; awake, Master Ford! There’s a hole made in your best coat, Master Ford. This ’tis to be married; this ’tis to have linen and buck-baskets! Well, I will proclaim myself what I am. I will now take the lecher. He is at my house. He cannot scape me. ’Tis impossible he should. He cannot creep into a half-penny purse, nor into a pepperbox. But, lest the devil that guides him should aid him, I will search impossible places. Though what I am I cannot avoid, yet to be what I would not shall not make me tame. If I have horns to make one mad, let the proverb go with me: I’ll be horn-mad.  [_Exit._]
  ACT IV  SCENE I. The street
Enter Mistress Page, Mistress Quickly and William.  MISTRESS PAGE. Is he at Master Ford’s already, think’st thou?  MISTRESS QUICKLY. Sure he is by this; or will be presently. But truly he is very courageous mad about his throwing into the water. Mistress Ford desires you to come suddenly.  MISTRESS PAGE. I’ll be with her by and by. I’ll but bring my young man here to school. Look where his master comes; ’tis a playing day, I see.  Enter Sir Hugh Evans.  How now, Sir Hugh, no school today?  EVANS. No, Master Slender is let the boys leave to play.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. Blessing of his heart!  MISTRESS PAGE. Sir Hugh, my husband says my son profits nothing in the world at his book. I pray you ask him some questions in his accidence.  EVANS. Come hither, William. Hold up your head, come.  MISTRESS PAGE. Come on, sirrah. Hold up your head. Answer your master, be not afraid.  EVANS. William, how many numbers is in nouns?  WILLIAM. Two.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. Truly, I thought there had been one number more, because they say “’Od’s nouns.”  EVANS. Peace your tattlings! What is “fair,” William?  WILLIAM. _Pulcher_.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. Polecats? There are fairer things than polecats, sure.  EVANS. You are a very simplicity ’oman; I pray you, peace.—What is _lapis_, William?  WILLIAM. A stone.  EVANS. And what is “a stone,” William?  WILLIAM. A pebble.  EVANS. No, it is _lapis_. I pray you remember in your prain.  WILLIAM. _Lapis_.  EVANS. That is a good William. What is he, William, that does lend articles?  WILLIAM. Articles are borrowed of the pronoun, and be thus declined: _singulariter, nominativo, hic, haec, hoc_.  EVANS. _Nominativo, hig, haeg, hog_, pray you, mark: _genitivo, huius_. Well, what is your accusative case?  WILLIAM. _Accusativo, hinc_.  EVANS. I pray you, have your remembrance, child. _Accusativo, hung, hang, hog_.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. “Hang-hog” is Latin for bacon, I warrant you.  EVANS. Leave your prabbles, ’oman.—What is the focative case, William?  WILLIAM. O—_vocativo_—O—  EVANS. Remember, William; focative is _caret_.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. And that’s a good root.  EVANS. ’Oman, forbear.  MISTRESS PAGE. Peace.  EVANS. What is your genitive case plural, William?  WILLIAM. Genitive case?  EVANS. Ay.  WILLIAM. Genitive: _horum, harum, horum_.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. Vengeance of Jenny’s case, fie on her! Never name her, child, if she be a whore.  EVANS. For shame, ’oman.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. You do ill to teach the child such words.—He teaches him to hick and to hack, which they’ll do fast enough of themselves; and to call “whore ’m”!—Fie upon you!  EVANS. ’Oman, art thou lunatics? Hast thou no understandings for thy cases, and the numbers of the genders? Thou art as foolish Christian creatures as I would desires.  MISTRESS PAGE. [_To Quickly_.] Prithee, hold thy peace.  EVANS. Show me now, William, some declensions of your pronouns.  WILLIAM. Forsooth, I have forgot.  EVANS. It is _qui, quae, quod_. If you forget your _quis_, your _quaes_, and your _quods_, you must be preeches. Go your ways and play, go.  MISTRESS PAGE. He is a better scholar than I thought he was.  EVANS. He is a good sprag memory. Farewell, Mistress Page.  MISTRESS PAGE. Adieu, good Sir Hugh.  [_Exit Sir Hugh Evans._]  Get you home, boy. Come, we stay too long.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. A room in Ford’s house  Enter Falstaff and Mistress Ford.  FALSTAFF. Mistress Ford, your sorrow hath eaten up my sufferance. I see you are obsequious in your love, and I profess requital to a hair’s breadth, not only, Mistress Ford, in the simple office of love, but in all the accoutrement, compliment, and ceremony of it. But are you sure of your husband now?  MISTRESS FORD. He’s a-birding, sweet Sir John.  MISTRESS PAGE. [_Within_.] What ho, gossip Ford, what ho!  MISTRESS FORD. Step into the chamber, Sir John.  [_Exit Falstaff._]  Enter Mistress Page.  MISTRESS PAGE. How now, sweetheart, who’s at home besides yourself?  MISTRESS FORD. Why, none but mine own people.  MISTRESS PAGE. Indeed?  MISTRESS FORD. No, certainly. [_Aside to her_.] Speak louder.  MISTRESS PAGE. Truly, I am so glad you have nobody here.  MISTRESS FORD. Why?  MISTRESS PAGE. Why, woman, your husband is in his old lunes again. He so takes on yonder with my husband, so rails against all married mankind, so curses all Eve’s daughters, of what complexion soever, and so buffets himself on the forehead, crying “Peer out, peer out!” that any madness I ever yet beheld seemed but tameness, civility, and patience, to this his distemper he is in now. I am glad the fat knight is not here.  MISTRESS FORD. Why, does he talk of him?  MISTRESS PAGE. Of none but him, and swears he was carried out, the last time he searched for him, in a basket; protests to my husband he is now here; and hath drawn him and the rest of their company from their sport, to make another experiment of his suspicion. But I am glad the knight is not here. Now he shall see his own foolery.  MISTRESS FORD. How near is he, Mistress Page?  MISTRESS PAGE. Hard by, at street end. He will be here anon.  MISTRESS FORD. I am undone! The knight is here.  MISTRESS PAGE. Why, then, you are utterly shamed, and he’s but a dead man. What a woman are you! Away with him, away with him! Better shame than murder.  MISTRESS FORD. Which way should he go? How should I bestow him? Shall I put him into the basket again?  Enter Falstaff.  FALSTAFF. No, I’ll come no more i’ the basket. May I not go out ere he come?  MISTRESS PAGE. Alas, three of Master Ford’s brothers watch the door with pistols, that none shall issue out, otherwise you might slip away ere he came. But what make you here?  FALSTAFF. What shall I do? I’ll creep up into the chimney.  MISTRESS FORD. There they always use to discharge their birding-pieces.  MISTRESS PAGE. Creep into the kiln-hole.  FALSTAFF. Where is it?  MISTRESS FORD. He will seek there, on my word. Neither press, coffer, chest, trunk, well, vault, but he hath an abstract for the remembrance of such places, and goes to them by his note. There is no hiding you in the house.  FALSTAFF. I’ll go out then.  MISTRESS PAGE. If you go out in your own semblance, you die, Sir John—unless you go out disguised.  MISTRESS FORD. How might we disguise him?  MISTRESS PAGE. Alas the day, I know not. There is no woman’s gown big enough for him; otherwise he might put on a hat, a muffler, and a kerchief, and so escape.  FALSTAFF. Good hearts, devise something. Any extremity rather than a mischief.  MISTRESS FORD. My maid’s aunt, the fat woman of Brentford, has a gown above.  MISTRESS PAGE. On my word, it will serve him. She’s as big as he is. And there’s her thrummed hat, and her muffler too.—Run up, Sir John.  MISTRESS FORD. Go, go, sweet Sir John. Mistress Page and I will look some linen for your head.  MISTRESS PAGE. Quick, quick! We’ll come dress you straight; put on the gown the while.  [_Exit Falstaff._]  MISTRESS FORD. I would my husband would meet him in this shape. He cannot abide the old woman of Brentford; he swears she’s a witch, forbade her my house, and hath threatened to beat her.  MISTRESS PAGE. Heaven guide him to thy husband’s cudgel and the devil guide his cudgel afterwards!  MISTRESS FORD. But is my husband coming?  MISTRESS PAGE. Ay, in good sadness is he, and talks of the basket too, howsoever he hath had intelligence.  MISTRESS FORD. We’ll try that; for I’ll appoint my men to carry the basket again, to meet him at the door with it as they did last time.  MISTRESS PAGE. Nay, but he’ll be here presently. Let’s go dress him like the witch of Brentford.  MISTRESS FORD. I’ll first direct my men what they shall do with the basket. Go up, I’ll bring linen for him straight.  [_Exit Mistress Ford._]  MISTRESS PAGE. Hang him, dishonest varlet! We cannot misuse him enough. We’ll leave a proof, by that which we will do, Wives may be merry and yet honest too. We do not act that often jest and laugh; ’Tis old but true: “Still swine eats all the draff.”  [_Exit._]  Enter Mistress Ford with John and Robert.  MISTRESS FORD. Go, sirs, take the basket again on your shoulders. Your master is hard at door; if he bid you set it down, obey him. Quickly, dispatch.  [_Exit Mistress Ford._]  JOHN. Come, come, take it up.  ROBERT. Pray heaven it be not full of knight again.  JOHN. I hope not, I had lief as bear so much lead.  Enter Ford, Page, Shallow, Caius and Sir Hugh Evans.  FORD Ay, but if it prove true, Master Page, have you any way then to unfool me again?—Set down the basket, villain! Somebody call my wife. Youth in a basket! O you panderly rascals! There’s a knot, a gin, a pack, a conspiracy against me. Now shall the devil be shamed.—What, wife, I say! Come, come forth! Behold what honest clothes you send forth to bleaching!  PAGE. Why, this passes, Master Ford! You are not to go loose any longer; you must be pinioned.  EVANS. Why, this is lunatics, this is mad as a mad dog.  SHALLOW. Indeed, Master Ford, this is not well, indeed.  FORD. So say I too, sir.  Enter Mistress Ford.  Come hither, Mistress Ford—Mistress Ford, the honest woman, the modest wife, the virtuous creature, that hath the jealous fool to her husband! I suspect without cause, mistress, do I?  MISTRESS FORD. Heaven be my witness you do, if you suspect me in any dishonesty.  FORD. Well said, brazen-face, hold it out.—Come forth, sirrah.  [_Pulls clothes out of the basket._]  PAGE. This passes.  MISTRESS FORD. Are you not ashamed? Let the clothes alone.  FORD. I shall find you anon.  EVANS. ’Tis unreasonable. Will you take up your wife’s clothes? Come, away.  FORD. Empty the basket, I say.  MISTRESS FORD. Why, man, why?  FORD. Master Page, as I am a man, there was one conveyed out of my house yesterday in this basket. Why may not he be there again? In my house I am sure he is. My intelligence is true, my jealousy is reasonable.—Pluck me out all the linen.  MISTRESS FORD. If you find a man there, he shall die a flea’s death.  PAGE. Here’s no man.  SHALLOW. By my fidelity, this is not well, Master Ford, this wrongs you.  EVANS. Master Ford, you must pray, and not follow the imaginations of your own heart. This is jealousies.  FORD. Well, he’s not here I seek for.  PAGE. No, nor nowhere else but in your brain.  FORD Help to search my house this one time. If I find not what I seek, show no colour for my extremity, let me for ever be your table-sport. Let them say of me “As jealous as Ford, that searched a hollow walnut for his wife’s leman.” Satisfy me once more, once more search with me.  [_Exeunt John and Robert with the basket._]  MISTRESS FORD. What, ho, Mistress Page! Come you and the old woman down; my husband will come into the chamber.  FORD. Old woman? What old woman’s that?  MISTRESS FORD. Why, it is my maid’s aunt of Brentford.  FORD. A witch, a quean, an old cozening quean! Have I not forbid her my house? She comes of errands, does she? We are simple men; we do not know what’s brought to pass under the profession of fortune-telling. She works by charms, by spells, by the figure, and such daubery as this is, beyond our element. We know nothing.—Come down, you witch, you hag, you! Come down, I say!  MISTRESS FORD. Nay, good sweet husband!—Good gentlemen, let him not strike the old woman.  Enter Falstaff disguised as an old woman, led by Mistress Page.  MISTRESS PAGE. Come, Mother Prat; come, give me your hand.  FORD. I’ll prat her. [_Beats him_.] Out of my door, you witch, you rag, you baggage, you polecat, you runnion! Out, out! I’ll conjure you, I’ll fortune-tell you.  [_Exit Falstaff._]  MISTRESS PAGE. Are you not ashamed? I think you have killed the poor woman.  MISTRESS FORD. Nay, he will do it. ’Tis a goodly credit for you.  FORD. Hang her, witch!  EVANS. By yea and no, I think the ’oman is a witch indeed. I like not when a ’oman has a great peard. I spy a great peard under her muffler.  FORD. Will you follow, gentlemen? I beseech you follow, see but the issue of my jealousy. If I cry out thus upon no trail, never trust me when I open again.  PAGE. Let’s obey his humour a little further. Come, gentlemen.  [_Exeunt Ford, Page, Caius, Evans and Shallow._]  MISTRESS PAGE. Trust me, he beat him most pitifully.  MISTRESS FORD. Nay, by th’ mass, that he did not; he beat him most unpitifully, methought.  MISTRESS PAGE. I’ll have the cudgel hallowed and hung o’er the altar. It hath done meritorious service.  MISTRESS FORD. What think you? May we, with the warrant of womanhood and the witness of a good conscience, pursue him with any further revenge?  MISTRESS PAGE. The spirit of wantonness is sure scared out of him. If the devil have him not in fee-simple, with fine and recovery, he will never, I think, in the way of waste, attempt us again.  MISTRESS FORD. Shall we tell our husbands how we have served him?  MISTRESS PAGE. Yes, by all means, if it be but to scrape the figures out of your husband’s brains. If they can find in their hearts the poor unvirtuous fat knight shall be any further afflicted, we two will still be the ministers.  MISTRESS FORD. I’ll warrant they’ll have him publicly shamed, and methinks there would be no period to the jest should he not be publicly shamed.  MISTRESS PAGE. Come, to the forge with it, then shape it. I would not have things cool.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. A room in the Garter Inn  Enter Host and Bardolph.  BARDOLPH. Sir, the Germans desire to have three of your horses. The Duke himself will be tomorrow at court, and they are going to meet him.  HOST. What duke should that be comes so secretly? I hear not of him in the court. Let me speak with the gentlemen. They speak English?  BARDOLPH. Ay, sir. I’ll call them to you.  HOST. They shall have my horses, but I’ll make them pay, I’ll sauce them. They have had my house a week at command; I have turned away my other guests. They must come off, I’ll sauce them. Come.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IV. A room in Ford’s house  Enter Page, Ford, Mistress Page, Mistress Ford and Sir Hugh Evans.  EVANS. ’Tis one of the best discretions of a ’oman as ever I did look upon.  PAGE. And did he send you both these letters at an instant?  MISTRESS PAGE. Within a quarter of an hour.  FORD. Pardon me, wife. Henceforth, do what thou wilt. I rather will suspect the sun with cold Than thee with wantonness. Now doth thy honour stand, In him that was of late an heretic, As firm as faith.  PAGE. ’Tis well, ’tis well, no more. Be not as extreme in submission as in offence. But let our plot go forward. Let our wives Yet once again, to make us public sport, Appoint a meeting with this old fat fellow, Where we may take him and disgrace him for it.  FORD. There is no better way than that they spoke of.  PAGE. How? To send him word they’ll meet him in the park at midnight? Fie, fie, he’ll never come.  EVANS. You say he has been thrown in the rivers, and has been grievously peaten as an old ’oman. Methinks there should be terrors in him, that he should not come. Methinks his flesh is punished; he shall have no desires.  PAGE. So think I too.  MISTRESS FORD. Devise but how you’ll use him when he comes, And let us two devise to bring him thither.  MISTRESS PAGE. There is an old tale goes that Herne the hunter, Sometime a keeper here in Windsor Forest, Doth all the winter time, at still midnight, Walk round about an oak, with great ragged horns, And there he blasts the tree, and takes the cattle, And makes milch-kine yield blood, and shakes a chain In a most hideous and dreadful manner. You have heard of such a spirit, and well you know The superstitious idle-headed eld Received and did deliver to our age, This tale of Herne the hunter for a truth.  PAGE. Why, yet there want not many that do fear In deep of night to walk by this Herne’s oak. But what of this?  MISTRESS FORD. Marry, this is our device, That Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us, Disguised like Herne, with huge horns on his head.  PAGE. Well, let it not be doubted but he’ll come, And in this shape; when you have brought him thither, What shall be done with him? What is your plot?  MISTRESS PAGE. That likewise have we thought upon, and thus: Nan Page my daughter, and my little son, And three or four more of their growth, we’ll dress Like urchins, oafs and fairies, green and white, With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads And rattles in their hands. Upon a sudden, As Falstaff, she, and I are newly met, Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once With some diffused song; upon their sight We two in great amazedness will fly. Then let them all encircle him about, And fairy-like, to pinch the unclean knight, And ask him why, that hour of fairy revel, In their so sacred paths he dares to tread In shape profane.  MISTRESS FORD. And till he tell the truth, Let the supposed fairies pinch him sound And burn him with their tapers.  MISTRESS PAGE. The truth being known, We’ll all present ourselves, dis-horn the spirit, And mock him home to Windsor.  FORD. The children must Be practised well to this, or they’ll ne’er do ’t.  EVANS. I will teach the children their behaviours, and I will be like a jackanapes also, to burn the knight with my taber.  FORD. That will be excellent. I’ll go buy them vizards.  MISTRESS PAGE. My Nan shall be the queen of all the fairies, Finely attired in a robe of white.  PAGE. That silk will I go buy. [_Aside_.] And in that time Shall Master Slender steal my Nan away, And marry her at Eton.—Go, send to Falstaff straight.  FORD. Nay, I’ll to him again in name of Brook. He’ll tell me all his purpose. Sure, he’ll come.  MISTRESS PAGE. Fear not you that. Go, get us properties And tricking for our fairies.  EVANS. Let us about it. It is admirable pleasures and fery honest knaveries.  [_Exeunt Page, Ford and Evans._]  MISTRESS PAGE. Go, Mistress Ford. Send quickly to Sir John to know his mind.  [_Exit Mistress Ford._]  I’ll to the Doctor. He hath my good will, And none but he, to marry with Nan Page. That Slender, though well landed, is an idiot, And he my husband best of all affects. The Doctor is well moneyed, and his friends Potent at court. He, none but he, shall have her, Though twenty thousand worthier come to crave her.  [_Exit._]  SCENE V. A room in the Garter Inn  Enter Host and Simple.  HOST. What wouldst thou have, boor? What, thick-skin? Speak, breathe, discuss; brief, short, quick, snap.  SIMPLE. Marry, sir, I come to speak with Sir John Falstaff from Master Slender.  HOST. There’s his chamber, his house, his castle, his standing-bed and truckle-bed. ’Tis painted about with the story of the Prodigal, fresh and new. Go, knock and call. He’ll speak like an Anthropophaginian unto thee. Knock, I say.  SIMPLE. There’s an old woman, a fat woman, gone up into his chamber. I’ll be so bold as stay, sir, till she come down. I come to speak with her, indeed.  HOST. Ha? A fat woman? The knight may be robbed. I’ll call.—Bully knight! Bully Sir John! Speak from thy lungs military. Art thou there? It is thine host, thine Ephesian, calls.  FALSTAFF. [_Above_.] How now, mine host?  HOST. Here’s a Bohemian-Tartar tarries the coming down of thy fat woman. Let her descend, bully, let her descend. My chambers are honourable. Fie! Privacy? Fie!  Enter Falstaff.  FALSTAFF. There was, mine host, an old fat woman even now with me, but she’s gone.  SIMPLE. Pray you, sir, was’t not the wise woman of Brentford?  FALSTAFF. Ay, marry was it, mussel-shell. What would you with her?  SIMPLE. My master, sir, my Master Slender, sent to her, seeing her go through the streets, to know, sir, whether one Nym, sir, that beguiled him of a chain, had the chain or no.  FALSTAFF. I spake with the old woman about it.  SIMPLE. And what says she, I pray, sir?  FALSTAFF. Marry, she says that the very same man that beguiled Master Slender of his chain cozened him of it.  SIMPLE. I would I could have spoken with the woman herself. I had other things to have spoken with her too, from him.  FALSTAFF. What are they? Let us know.  HOST. Ay, come. Quick.  SIMPLE. I may not conceal them, sir.  FALSTAFF. Conceal them, or thou diest.  SIMPLE. Why, sir, they were nothing but about Mistress Anne Page, to know if it were my master’s fortune to have her or no.  FALSTAFF. ’Tis, ’tis his fortune.  SIMPLE. What sir?  FALSTAFF. To have her, or no. Go, say the woman told me so.  SIMPLE. May I be bold to say so, sir?  FALSTAFF. Ay, sir; like who more bold?  SIMPLE. I thank your worship; I shall make my master glad with these tidings.  [_Exit Simple._]  HOST Thou art clerkly, thou art clerkly, Sir John. Was there a wise woman with thee?  FALSTAFF. Ay, that there was, mine host; one that hath taught me more wit than ever I learned before in my life; and I paid nothing for it neither, but was paid for my learning.  Enter Bardolph.  BARDOLPH Out, alas, sir, cozenage, mere cozenage!  HOST. Where be my horses? Speak well of them, varletto.  BARDOLPH. Run away, with the cozeners. For so soon as I came beyond Eton, they threw me off from behind one of them, in a slough of mire, and set spurs and away, like three German devils, three Doctor Faustuses.  HOST. They are gone but to meet the Duke, villain, do not say they be fled. Germans are honest men.  Enter Sir Hugh Evans.  EVANS Where is mine host?  HOST. What is the matter, sir?  EVANS. Have a care of your entertainments. There is a friend of mine come to town tells me there is three cozen-Germans that has cozened all the hosts of Readings, of Maidenhead, of Colebrook, of horses and money. I tell you for good will, look you. You are wise, and full of gibes and vlouting-stocks, and ’tis not convenient you should be cozened. Fare you well.  [_Exit Evans._]  Enter Doctor Caius.  CAIUS. Vere is mine host de Jarteer?  HOST. Here, Master Doctor, in perplexity and doubtful dilemma.  CAIUS. I cannot tell vat is dat, but it is tell-a me dat you make grand preparation for a Duke de Jamany. By my trot, dere is no duke that the court is know to come. I tell you for good will. Adieu.  [_Exit Doctor Caius._]  HOST Hue and cry, villain, go!—Assist me, knight, I am undone.—Fly, run, hue and cry, villain, I am undone!  [_Exeunt Host and Bardolph._]  FALSTAFF. I would all the world might be cozened, for I have been cozened and beaten too. If it should come to the ear of the court how I have been transformed, and how my transformation hath been washed and cudgelled, they would melt me out of my fat drop by drop, and liquor fishermen’s boots with me. I warrant they would whip me with their fine wits till I were as crestfallen as a dried pear. I never prospered since I forswore myself at primero. Well, if my wind were but long enough, I would repent.  Enter Mistress Quickly.  Now, whence come you?  MISTRESS QUICKLY. From the two parties, forsooth.  FALSTAFF. The devil take one party and his dam the other, and so they shall be both bestowed. I have suffered more for their sakes, more than the villainous inconstancy of man’s disposition is able to bear.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. And have not they suffered? Yes, I warrant, speciously one of them. Mistress Ford, good heart, is beaten black and blue, that you cannot see a white spot about her.  FALSTAFF. What tellst thou me of black and blue? I was beaten myself into all the colours of the rainbow, and was like to be apprehended for the witch of Brentford. But that my admirable dexterity of wit, my counterfeiting the action of an old woman, delivered me, the knave constable had set me i’ the stocks, i’ the common stocks, for a witch.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. Sir, let me speak with you in your chamber, you shall hear how things go, and, I warrant, to your content. Here is a letter will say somewhat. Good hearts, what ado here is to bring you together! Sure, one of you does not serve heaven well, that you are so crossed.  FALSTAFF. Come up into my chamber.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE VI. Another room in the Garter Inn  Enter Fenton and Host.  HOST. Master Fenton, talk not to me. My mind is heavy. I will give over all.  FENTON. Yet hear me speak. Assist me in my purpose, And, as I am a gentleman, I’ll give thee A hundred pound in gold more than your loss.  HOST. I will hear you, Master Fenton, and I will, at the least, keep your counsel.  FENTON. From time to time I have acquainted you With the dear love I bear to fair Anne Page, Who mutually hath answered my affection, So far forth as herself might be her chooser, Even to my wish. I have a letter from her Of such contents as you will wonder at, The mirth whereof so larded with my matter That neither singly can be manifested Without the show of both, wherein fat Falstaff Hath a great scene; the image of the jest I’ll show you here at large. Hark, good mine host: Tonight at Herne’s oak, just ’twixt twelve and one, Must my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen— The purpose why is here—in which disguise, While other jests are something rank on foot, Her father hath commanded her to slip Away with Slender, and with him at Eton Immediately to marry. She hath consented. Now, sir, Her mother, even strong against that match And firm for Doctor Caius, hath appointed That he shall likewise shuffle her away, While other sports are tasking of their minds, And at the dean’ry, where a priest attends, Straight marry her. To this her mother’s plot She, seemingly obedient, likewise hath Made promise to the doctor. Now thus it rests: Her father means she shall be all in white And in that habit, when Slender sees his time To take her by the hand and bid her go, She shall go with him. Her mother hath intended The better to denote her to the doctor, For they must all be masked and vizarded— That quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed, With ribbons pendant flaring ’bout her head; And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe, To pinch her by the hand, and on that token The maid hath given consent to go with him.  HOST. Which means she to deceive, father or mother?  FENTON. Both, my good host, to go along with me. And here it rests, that you’ll procure the vicar To stay for me at church, ’twixt twelve and one, And, in the lawful name of marrying, To give our hearts united ceremony.  HOST. Well, husband your device; I’ll to the vicar. Bring you the maid, you shall not lack a priest.  FENTON. So shall I evermore be bound to thee; Besides, I’ll make a present recompense.  [_Exeunt._]
  ACT V  SCENE I. A room in the Garter Inn
Enter Falstaff and Mistress Quickly.  FALSTAFF. Prithee, no more prattling. Go. I’ll hold. This is the third time; I hope good luck lies in odd numbers. Away, go! They say there is divinity in odd numbers, either in nativity, chance, or death. Away!  MISTRESS QUICKLY. I’ll provide you a chain, and I’ll do what I can to get you a pair of horns.  FALSTAFF. Away, I say; time wears. Hold up your head, and mince.  [_Exit Mistress Quickly._]  Enter Ford.  How now, Master Brook! Master Brook, the matter will be known tonight or never. Be you in the park about midnight, at Herne’s oak, and you shall see wonders.  FORD. Went you not to her yesterday, sir, as you told me you had appointed?  FALSTAFF. I went to her, Master Brook, as you see, like a poor old man, but I came from her, Master Brook, like a poor old woman. That same knave Ford, her husband, hath the finest mad devil of jealousy in him, Master Brook, that ever governed frenzy. I will tell you he beat me grievously, in the shape of a woman; for in the shape of man, Master Brook, I fear not Goliath with a weaver’s beam, because I know also life is a shuttle. I am in haste. Go along with me; I’ll tell you all, Master Brook. Since I plucked geese, played truant, and whipped top, I knew not what ’twas to be beaten till lately. Follow me, I’ll tell you strange things of this knave Ford, on whom tonight I will be revenged, and I will deliver his wife into your hand. Follow. Strange things in hand, Master Brook! Follow.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. Windsor Park  Enter Page, Shallow and Slender.  PAGE. Come, come. We’ll couch i’ the castle ditch till we see the light of our fairies. Remember, son Slender, my daughter—  SLENDER. Ay, forsooth. I have spoke with her, and we have a nay-word how to know one another. I come to her in white and cry “mum”; she cries “budget”; and by that we know one another.  SHALLOW. That’s good too. But what needs either your “mum” or her “budget”? The white will decipher her well enough. It hath struck ten o’clock.  PAGE. The night is dark. Light and spirits will become it well. Heaven prosper our sport! No man means evil but the devil, and we shall know him by his horns. Let’s away; follow me.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. The street in Windsor  Enter Mistress Page, Mistress Ford and Doctor Caius.  MISTRESS PAGE. Master Doctor, my daughter is in green. When you see your time, take her by the hand, away with her to the deanery, and dispatch it quickly. Go before into the park. We two must go together.  CAIUS. I know vat I have to do. Adieu.  MISTRESS PAGE. Fare you well, sir.  [_Exit Caius._]  My husband will not rejoice so much at the abuse of Falstaff as he will chafe at the doctor’s marrying my daughter. But ’tis no matter. Better a little chiding than a great deal of heartbreak.  MISTRESS FORD. Where is Nan now, and her troop of fairies, and the Welsh devil Hugh?  MISTRESS PAGE. They are all couched in a pit hard by Herne’s oak, with obscured lights, which, at the very instant of Falstaff’s and our meeting, they will at once display to the night.  MISTRESS FORD. That cannot choose but amaze him.  MISTRESS PAGE. If he be not amazed, he will be mocked; if he be amazed, he will every way be mocked.  MISTRESS FORD. We’ll betray him finely.  MISTRESS PAGE. Against such lewdsters and their lechery, Those that betray them do no treachery.  MISTRESS FORD. The hour draws on. To the oak, to the oak!  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IV. Windsor Park  Enter Sir Hugh Evans disguised, and children as Fairies.  EVANS. Trib, trib, fairies. Come, and remember your parts. Be pold, I pray you, follow me into the pit, and when I give the watch-’ords, do as I pid you. Come, come; trib, trib.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE V. Another part of the Park  Enter Falstaff wearing a buck’s head.  FALSTAFF. The Windsor bell hath struck twelve, the minute draws on. Now the hot-blooded gods assist me! Remember, Jove, thou wast a bull for thy Europa; love set on thy horns. O powerful love, that in some respects, makes a beast a man, in some other a man a beast! You were also, Jupiter, a swan for the love of Leda. O omnipotent love, how near the god drew to the complexion of a goose! A fault done first in the form of a beast; O Jove, a beastly fault! And then another fault in the semblance of a fowl; think on’t, Jove, a foul fault! When gods have hot backs, what shall poor men do? For me, I am here a Windsor stag, and the fattest, I think, i’ the forest. Send me a cool rut-time, Jove, or who can blame me to piss my tallow? Who comes here? My doe?  Enter Mistress Ford and Mistress Page.  MISTRESS FORD. Sir John? Art thou there, my deer, my male deer?  FALSTAFF. My doe with the black scut! Let the sky rain potatoes, let it thunder to the tune of “Greensleeves”, hail kissing-comfits and snow eringoes; let there come a tempest of provocation, I will shelter me here.  [_He embraces her._]  MISTRESS FORD. Mistress Page is come with me, sweetheart.  FALSTAFF. Divide me like a bribed buck, each a haunch. I will keep my sides to myself, my shoulders for the fellow of this walk, and my horns I bequeath your husbands. Am I a woodman, ha? Speak I like Herne the hunter? Why, now is Cupid a child of conscience; he makes restitution. As I am a true spirit, welcome!  [_A noise of horns within._]  MISTRESS PAGE. Alas, what noise?  MISTRESS FORD. Heaven forgive our sins!  FALSTAFF. What should this be?  MISTRESS FORD and MISTRESS PAGE. Away, away!  [_They run off._]  FALSTAFF. I think the devil will not have me damned, lest the oil that’s in me should set hell on fire; he would never else cross me thus.  Enter Mistress Quickly as the Queen of Fairies, Sir Hugh Evans as a Satyr, Pistol as Hobgoblin, Anne Page and children as Fairies, carrying tapers.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. Fairies, black, grey, green, and white, You moonshine revellers and shades of night, You orphan heirs of fixed destiny, Attend your office and your quality. Crier Hobgoblin, make the fairy oyes.  PISTOL. Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys! Cricket, to Windsor chimneys shalt thou leap, Where fires thou find’st unraked and hearths unswept, There pinch the maids as blue as bilberry. Our radiant queen hates sluts and sluttery.  FALSTAFF. They are fairies, he that speaks to them shall die. I’ll wink and couch. No man their works must eye.  [_Lies down upon his face._]  EVANS Where’s Bead? Go you, and where you find a maid That ere she sleep has thrice her prayers said, Rein up the organs of her fantasy; Sleep she as sound as careless infancy. But those as sleep and think not on their sins, Pinch them, arms, legs, backs, shoulders, sides, and shins.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. About, about! Search Windsor castle, elves, within and out. Strew good luck, oafs, on every sacred room, That it may stand till the perpetual doom In state as wholesome as in state ’tis fit, Worthy the owner and the owner it. The several chairs of order look you scour With juice of balm and every precious flower. Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest, With loyal blazon, evermore be blest! And nightly, meadow-fairies, look you sing, Like to the Garter’s compass, in a ring. Th’ expressure that it bears, green let it be, More fertile-fresh than all the field to see; And _Honi soit qui mal y pense_ write In em’rald tufts, flowers purple, blue and white, Like sapphire, pearl, and rich embroidery, Buckled below fair knighthood’s bending knee. Fairies use flowers for their charactery. Away, disperse! But till ’tis one o’clock, Our dance of custom round about the oak Of Herne the hunter let us not forget.  EVANS. Pray you, lock hand in hand, yourselves in order set; And twenty glow-worms shall our lanterns be, To guide our measure round about the tree. But stay, I smell a man of middle earth.  FALSTAFF. Heavens defend me from that Welsh fairy, lest he transform me to a piece of cheese!  PISTOL. Vile worm, thou wast o’erlooked even in thy birth.  MISTRESS QUICKLY. With trial-fire touch me his finger-end. If he be chaste, the flame will back descend And turn him to no pain; but if he start, It is the flesh of a corrupted heart.  PISTOL. A trial, come.  EVANS. Come, will this wood take fire?  [_They put the tapers to his fingers, and he starts._]  FALSTAFF. O, o, o!  MISTRESS QUICKLY. Corrupt, corrupt, and tainted in desire! About him, fairies, sing a scornful rhyme, And, as you trip, still pinch him to your time.  SONG. Fie on sinful fantasy! Fie on lust and luxury! Lust is but a bloody fire, Kindled with unchaste desire, Fed in heart, whose flames aspire, As thoughts do blow them, higher and higher. Pinch him, fairies, mutually; Pinch him for his villainy. Pinch him and burn him and turn him about, Till candles and starlight and moonshine be out.  [_During the song they pinch him, and Doctor Caius comes one way and steals away a boy in green; and Slender another way takes a boy in white; Fenton comes in and steals away Anne Page. A noise of hunting is heard within and all the fairies run away. Falstaff pulls off his buck’s head, and rises up._]  Enter Page, Ford, Mistress Page and Mistress Ford.  PAGE. Nay, do not fly. I think we have watched you now. Will none but Herne the hunter serve your turn?  MISTRESS PAGE. I pray you, come, hold up the jest no higher.— Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives? See you these, husband?  [_She points to the horns._]  Do not these fair yokes Become the forest better than the town?  FORD. Now, sir, who’s a cuckold now? Master Brook, Falstaff’s a knave, a cuckoldly knave. Here are his horns, Master Brook. And, Master Brook, he hath enjoyed nothing of Ford’s but his buck-basket, his cudgel, and twenty pounds of money, which must be paid to Master Brook. His horses are arrested for it, Master Brook.  MISTRESS FORD. Sir John, we have had ill luck, we could never meet. I will never take you for my love again, but I will always count you my deer.  FALSTAFF. I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass.  FORD. Ay, and an ox too. Both the proofs are extant.  FALSTAFF. And these are not fairies? I was three or four times in the thought they were not fairies; and yet the guiltiness of my mind, the sudden surprise of my powers, drove the grossness of the foppery into a received belief, in despite of the teeth of all rhyme and reason, that they were fairies. See now how wit may be made a Jack-a-Lent when ’tis upon ill employment!  EVANS. Sir John Falstaff, serve Got, and leave your desires, and fairies will not pinse you.  FORD. Well said, fairy Hugh.  EVANS. And leave you your jealousies too, I pray you.  FORD. I will never mistrust my wife again, till thou art able to woo her in good English.  FALSTAFF. Have I laid my brain in the sun, and dried it, that it wants matter to prevent so gross o’erreaching as this? Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too? Shall I have a cox-comb of frieze? ’Tis time I were choked with a piece of toasted cheese.  EVANS. Seese is not good to give putter. Your belly is all putter.  FALSTAFF. “Seese” and “putter”? Have I lived to stand at the taunt of one that makes fritters of English? This is enough to be the decay of lust and late-walking through the realm.  MISTRESS PAGE. Why, Sir John, do you think, though we would have thrust virtue out of our hearts by the head and shoulders, and have given ourselves without scruple to hell, that ever the devil could have made you our delight?  FORD. What, a hodge-pudding? A bag of flax?  MISTRESS PAGE. A puffed man?  PAGE. Old, cold, withered, and of intolerable entrails?  FORD. And one that is as slanderous as Satan?  PAGE. And as poor as Job?  FORD. And as wicked as his wife?  EVANS. And given to fornications, and to taverns, and sack, and wine, and metheglins, and to drinkings and swearings and starings, pribbles and prabbles?  FALSTAFF. Well, I am your theme. You have the start of me. I am dejected, I am not able to answer the Welsh flannel. Ignorance itself is a plummet o’er me. Use me as you will.  FORD. Marry, sir, we’ll bring you to Windsor to one Master Brook, that you have cozened of money, to whom you should have been a pander. Over and above that you have suffered, I think to repay that money will be a biting affliction.  PAGE. Yet be cheerful, knight. Thou shalt eat a posset tonight at my house, where I will desire thee to laugh at my wife, that now laughs at thee. Tell her Master Slender hath married her daughter.  MISTRESS PAGE. [_Aside_.] Doctors doubt that. If Anne Page be my daughter, she is, by this, Doctor Caius’ wife.  Enter Slender.  SLENDER Whoa, ho, ho, father Page!  PAGE. Son, how now! How now, son, have you dispatched?  SLENDER. Dispatched? I’ll make the best in Gloucestershire know on’t. Would I were hanged, la, else!  PAGE. Of what, son?  SLENDER. I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress Anne Page, and she’s a great lubberly boy. If it had not been i’ the church, I would have swinged him, or he should have swinged me. If I did not think it had been Anne Page, would I might never stir! And ’tis a postmaster’s boy.  PAGE. Upon my life, then, you took the wrong.  SLENDER. What need you tell me that? I think so, when I took a boy for a girl. If I had been married to him, for all he was in woman’s apparel, I would not have had him.  PAGE. Why, this is your own folly. Did not I tell you how you should know my daughter by her garments?  SLENDER. I went to her in white and cried “mum”, and she cried “budget”, as Anne and I had appointed, and yet it was not Anne, but a postmaster’s boy.  MISTRESS PAGE. Good George, be not angry. I knew of your purpose, turned my daughter into green, and indeed she is now with the doctor at the deanery, and there married.  Enter Doctor Caius.  CAIUS Vere is Mistress Page? By gar, I am cozened, I ha’ married _un garçon_, a boy; _un paysan_, by gar, a boy. It is not Anne Page. By gar, I am cozened.  MISTRESS PAGE. Why, did you take her in green?  CAIUS. Ay, by gar, and ’tis a boy. By gar, I’ll raise all Windsor.  FORD This is strange. Who hath got the right Anne?  Enter Fenton and Anne Page.  PAGE. My heart misgives me. Here comes Master Fenton.—How now, Master Fenton!  ANNE. Pardon, good father. Good my mother, pardon.  PAGE. Now, mistress, how chance you went not with Master Slender?  MISTRESS PAGE. Why went you not with Master Doctor, maid?  FENTON. You do amaze her. Hear the truth of it. You would have married her most shamefully, Where there was no proportion held in love. The truth is, she and I, long since contracted, Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us. Th’ offence is holy that she hath committed, And this deceit loses the name of craft, Of disobedience, or unduteous title, Since therein she doth evitate and shun A thousand irreligious cursed hours, Which forced marriage would have brought upon her.  FORD. Stand not amazed, here is no remedy. In love, the heavens themselves do guide the state. Money buys lands, and wives are sold by fate.  FALSTAFF. I am glad, though you have ta’en a special stand to strike at me, that your arrow hath glanced.  PAGE. Well, what remedy? Fenton, heaven give thee joy! What cannot be eschewed must be embraced.  FALSTAFF. When night-dogs run, all sorts of deer are chased.  MISTRESS PAGE. Well, I will muse no further.—Master Fenton, Heaven give you many, many merry days! Good husband, let us every one go home, And laugh this sport o’er by a country fire, Sir John and all.  FORD. Let it be so, Sir John, To Master Brook you yet shall hold your word, For he tonight shall lie with Mistress Ford.  [_Exeunt._]

THESEUS, Duke of Athens HIPPOLYTA, Queen of the Amazons, bethrothed to Theseus EGEUS, Father to Hermia HERMIA, daughter to Egeus, in love with Lysander HELENA, in love with Demetrius LYSANDER, in love with Hermia DEMETRIUS, in love with Hermia PHILOSTRATE, Master of the Revels to Theseus  QUINCE, the Carpenter SNUG, the Joiner BOTTOM, the Weaver FLUTE, the Bellows-mender SNOUT, the Tinker STARVELING, the Tailor  OBERON, King of the Fairies TITANIA, Queen of the Fairies PUCK, or ROBIN GOODFELLOW, a Fairy PEASEBLOSSOM, Fairy COBWEB, Fairy MOTH, Fairy MUSTARDSEED, Fairy  PYRAMUS, THISBE, WALL, MOONSHINE, LION; Characters in the Interlude performed by the Clowns  Other Fairies attending their King and Queen Attendants on Theseus and Hippolyta  SCENE: Athens, and a wood not far from it
  ACT I  SCENE I. Athens. A room in the Palace of Theseus
 Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Philostrate and Attendants.  THESEUS. Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour Draws on apace; four happy days bring in Another moon; but oh, methinks, how slow This old moon wanes! She lingers my desires, Like to a step-dame or a dowager, Long withering out a young man’s revenue.  HIPPOLYTA. Four days will quickly steep themselves in night; Four nights will quickly dream away the time; And then the moon, like to a silver bow New bent in heaven, shall behold the night Of our solemnities.  THESEUS. Go, Philostrate, Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments; Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth; Turn melancholy forth to funerals; The pale companion is not for our pomp.   [_Exit Philostrate._]  Hippolyta, I woo’d thee with my sword, And won thy love doing thee injuries; But I will wed thee in another key, With pomp, with triumph, and with revelling.   Enter Egeus, Hermia, Lysander and Demetrius.  EGEUS. Happy be Theseus, our renownèd Duke!  THESEUS. Thanks, good Egeus. What’s the news with thee?  EGEUS. Full of vexation come I, with complaint Against my child, my daughter Hermia. Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord, This man hath my consent to marry her. Stand forth, Lysander. And, my gracious Duke, This man hath bewitch’d the bosom of my child. Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes, And interchang’d love-tokens with my child. Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung, With feigning voice, verses of feigning love; And stol’n the impression of her fantasy With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gauds, conceits, Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats (messengers Of strong prevailment in unharden’d youth) With cunning hast thou filch’d my daughter’s heart, Turn’d her obedience (which is due to me) To stubborn harshness. And, my gracious Duke, Be it so she will not here before your grace Consent to marry with Demetrius, I beg the ancient privilege of Athens: As she is mine I may dispose of her; Which shall be either to this gentleman Or to her death, according to our law Immediately provided in that case.  THESEUS. What say you, Hermia? Be advis’d, fair maid. To you your father should be as a god; One that compos’d your beauties, yea, and one To whom you are but as a form in wax By him imprinted, and within his power To leave the figure, or disfigure it. Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.  HERMIA. So is Lysander.  THESEUS. In himself he is. But in this kind, wanting your father’s voice, The other must be held the worthier.  HERMIA. I would my father look’d but with my eyes.  THESEUS. Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.  HERMIA. I do entreat your Grace to pardon me. I know not by what power I am made bold, Nor how it may concern my modesty In such a presence here to plead my thoughts: But I beseech your Grace that I may know The worst that may befall me in this case, If I refuse to wed Demetrius.  THESEUS. Either to die the death, or to abjure For ever the society of men. Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires, Know of your youth, examine well your blood, Whether, if you yield not to your father’s choice, You can endure the livery of a nun, For aye to be in shady cloister mew’d, To live a barren sister all your life, Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon. Thrice-blessèd they that master so their blood To undergo such maiden pilgrimage, But earthlier happy is the rose distill’d Than that which, withering on the virgin thorn, Grows, lives, and dies, in single blessedness.  HERMIA. So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord, Ere I will yield my virgin patent up Unto his lordship, whose unwishèd yoke My soul consents not to give sovereignty.  THESEUS. Take time to pause; and by the next new moon The sealing-day betwixt my love and me For everlasting bond of fellowship, Upon that day either prepare to die For disobedience to your father’s will, Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would, Or on Diana’s altar to protest For aye austerity and single life.  DEMETRIUS. Relent, sweet Hermia; and, Lysander, yield Thy crazèd title to my certain right.  LYSANDER. You have her father’s love, Demetrius. Let me have Hermia’s. Do you marry him.  EGEUS. Scornful Lysander, true, he hath my love; And what is mine my love shall render him; And she is mine, and all my right of her I do estate unto Demetrius.  LYSANDER. I am, my lord, as well deriv’d as he, As well possess’d; my love is more than his; My fortunes every way as fairly rank’d, If not with vantage, as Demetrius’; And, which is more than all these boasts can be, I am belov’d of beauteous Hermia. Why should not I then prosecute my right? Demetrius, I’ll avouch it to his head, Made love to Nedar’s daughter, Helena, And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes, Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry, Upon this spotted and inconstant man.  THESEUS. I must confess that I have heard so much, And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof; But, being over-full of self-affairs, My mind did lose it.—But, Demetrius, come, And come, Egeus; you shall go with me. I have some private schooling for you both.— For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself To fit your fancies to your father’s will, Or else the law of Athens yields you up (Which by no means we may extenuate) To death, or to a vow of single life. Come, my Hippolyta. What cheer, my love? Demetrius and Egeus, go along; I must employ you in some business Against our nuptial, and confer with you Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.  EGEUS. With duty and desire we follow you.   [_Exeunt all but Lysander and Hermia._]  LYSANDER. How now, my love? Why is your cheek so pale? How chance the roses there do fade so fast?  HERMIA. Belike for want of rain, which I could well Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.  LYSANDER. Ay me! For aught that I could ever read, Could ever hear by tale or history, The course of true love never did run smooth. But either it was different in blood—  HERMIA. O cross! Too high to be enthrall’d to low.  LYSANDER. Or else misgraffèd in respect of years—  HERMIA. O spite! Too old to be engag’d to young.  LYSANDER. Or else it stood upon the choice of friends—  HERMIA. O hell! to choose love by another’s eyes!  LYSANDER. Or, if there were a sympathy in choice, War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it, Making it momentany as a sound, Swift as a shadow, short as any dream, Brief as the lightning in the collied night That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth, And, ere a man hath power to say, ‘Behold!’ The jaws of darkness do devour it up: So quick bright things come to confusion.  HERMIA. If then true lovers have ever cross’d, It stands as an edict in destiny. Then let us teach our trial patience, Because it is a customary cross, As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs, Wishes and tears, poor fancy’s followers.  LYSANDER. A good persuasion; therefore, hear me, Hermia. I have a widow aunt, a dowager Of great revenue, and she hath no child. From Athens is her house remote seven leagues, And she respects me as her only son. There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee, And to that place the sharp Athenian law Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then, Steal forth thy father’s house tomorrow night; And in the wood, a league without the town (Where I did meet thee once with Helena To do observance to a morn of May), There will I stay for thee.  HERMIA. My good Lysander! I swear to thee by Cupid’s strongest bow, By his best arrow with the golden head, By the simplicity of Venus’ doves, By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves, And by that fire which burn’d the Carthage queen When the false Trojan under sail was seen, By all the vows that ever men have broke (In number more than ever women spoke), In that same place thou hast appointed me, Tomorrow truly will I meet with thee.  LYSANDER. Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.   Enter Helena.  HERMIA. God speed fair Helena! Whither away?  HELENA. Call you me fair? That fair again unsay. Demetrius loves your fair. O happy fair! Your eyes are lode-stars and your tongue’s sweet air More tuneable than lark to shepherd’s ear, When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear. Sickness is catching. O were favour so, Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go. My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye, My tongue should catch your tongue’s sweet melody. Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated, The rest I’d give to be to you translated. O, teach me how you look, and with what art You sway the motion of Demetrius’ heart!  HERMIA. I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.  HELENA. O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!  HERMIA. I give him curses, yet he gives me love.  HELENA. O that my prayers could such affection move!  HERMIA. The more I hate, the more he follows me.  HELENA. The more I love, the more he hateth me.  HERMIA. His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.  HELENA. None but your beauty; would that fault were mine!  HERMIA. Take comfort: he no more shall see my face; Lysander and myself will fly this place. Before the time I did Lysander see, Seem’d Athens as a paradise to me. O, then, what graces in my love do dwell, That he hath turn’d a heaven into hell!  LYSANDER. Helen, to you our minds we will unfold: Tomorrow night, when Phoebe doth behold Her silver visage in the watery glass, Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass (A time that lovers’ flights doth still conceal), Through Athens’ gates have we devis’d to steal.  HERMIA. And in the wood where often you and I Upon faint primrose beds were wont to lie, Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet, There my Lysander and myself shall meet, And thence from Athens turn away our eyes, To seek new friends and stranger companies. Farewell, sweet playfellow. Pray thou for us, And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius! Keep word, Lysander. We must starve our sight From lovers’ food, till morrow deep midnight.  LYSANDER. I will, my Hermia.   [_Exit Hermia._]  Helena, adieu. As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!   [_Exit Lysander._]  HELENA. How happy some o’er other some can be! Through Athens I am thought as fair as she. But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so; He will not know what all but he do know. And as he errs, doting on Hermia’s eyes, So I, admiring of his qualities. Things base and vile, holding no quantity, Love can transpose to form and dignity. Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind; And therefore is wing’d Cupid painted blind. Nor hath love’s mind of any judgment taste. Wings, and no eyes, figure unheedy haste. And therefore is love said to be a child, Because in choice he is so oft beguil’d. As waggish boys in game themselves forswear, So the boy Love is perjur’d everywhere. For, ere Demetrius look’d on Hermia’s eyne, He hail’d down oaths that he was only mine; And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt, So he dissolv’d, and showers of oaths did melt. I will go tell him of fair Hermia’s flight. Then to the wood will he tomorrow night Pursue her; and for this intelligence If I have thanks, it is a dear expense. But herein mean I to enrich my pain, To have his sight thither and back again.   [_Exit Helena._]
SCENE II. The Same. A Room in a Cottage   Enter Quince, Snug, Bottom, Flute, Snout  and Starveling.  QUINCE. Is all our company here?  BOTTOM. You were best to call them generally, man by man, according to the scrip.  QUINCE. Here is the scroll of every man’s name, which is thought fit through all Athens, to play in our interlude before the Duke and Duchess, on his wedding-day at night.  BOTTOM. First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats on; then read the names of the actors; and so grow to a point.  QUINCE. Marry, our play is _The most lamentable comedy and most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisbe_.  BOTTOM. A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.  QUINCE. Answer, as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver.  BOTTOM. Ready. Name what part I am for, and proceed.  QUINCE. You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.  BOTTOM. What is Pyramus—a lover, or a tyrant?  QUINCE. A lover, that kills himself most gallantly for love.  BOTTOM. That will ask some tears in the true performing of it. If I do it, let the audience look to their eyes. I will move storms; I will condole in some measure. To the rest—yet my chief humour is for a tyrant. I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to tear a cat in, to make all split.      The raging rocks     And shivering shocks     Shall break the locks            Of prison gates,     And Phibbus’ car     Shall shine from far,     And make and mar            The foolish Fates.  This was lofty. Now name the rest of the players. This is Ercles’ vein, a tyrant’s vein; a lover is more condoling.  QUINCE. Francis Flute, the bellows-mender.  FLUTE. Here, Peter Quince.  QUINCE. Flute, you must take Thisbe on you.  FLUTE. What is Thisbe? A wandering knight?  QUINCE. It is the lady that Pyramus must love.  FLUTE. Nay, faith, let not me play a woman. I have a beard coming.  QUINCE. That’s all one. You shall play it in a mask, and you may speak as small as you will.  BOTTOM. And I may hide my face, let me play Thisbe too. I’ll speak in a monstrous little voice; ‘Thisne, Thisne!’—‘Ah, Pyramus, my lover dear! thy Thisbe dear! and lady dear!’  QUINCE. No, no, you must play Pyramus; and, Flute, you Thisbe.  BOTTOM. Well, proceed.  QUINCE. Robin Starveling, the tailor.  STARVELING. Here, Peter Quince.  QUINCE. Robin Starveling, you must play Thisbe’s mother. Tom Snout, the tinker.  SNOUT Here, Peter Quince.  QUINCE. You, Pyramus’ father; myself, Thisbe’s father; Snug, the joiner, you, the lion’s part. And, I hope here is a play fitted.  SNUG Have you the lion’s part written? Pray you, if it be, give it me, for I am slow of study.  QUINCE. You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.  BOTTOM. Let me play the lion too. I will roar that I will do any man’s heart good to hear me. I will roar that I will make the Duke say ‘Let him roar again, let him roar again.’  QUINCE. If you should do it too terribly, you would fright the Duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek; and that were enough to hang us all.  ALL That would hang us every mother’s son.  BOTTOM. I grant you, friends, if you should fright the ladies out of their wits, they would have no more discretion but to hang us. But I will aggravate my voice so, that I will roar you as gently as any sucking dove; I will roar you an ’twere any nightingale.  QUINCE. You can play no part but Pyramus, for Pyramus is a sweet-faced man; a proper man as one shall see in a summer’s day; a most lovely gentleman-like man. Therefore you must needs play Pyramus.  BOTTOM. Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I best to play it in?  QUINCE. Why, what you will.  BOTTOM. I will discharge it in either your straw-colour beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain beard, or your French-crown-colour beard, your perfect yellow.  QUINCE. Some of your French crowns have no hair at all, and then you will play bare-faced. But, masters, here are your parts, and I am to entreat you, request you, and desire you, to con them by tomorrow night; and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the town, by moonlight; there will we rehearse, for if we meet in the city, we shall be dogg’d with company, and our devices known. In the meantime I will draw a bill of properties, such as our play wants. I pray you fail me not.  BOTTOM. We will meet, and there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously. Take pains, be perfect; adieu.  QUINCE. At the Duke’s oak we meet.  BOTTOM. Enough. Hold, or cut bow-strings.   [_Exeunt._]
  ACT II  SCENE I. A wood near Athens
 Enter a Fairy at one door, and Puck at another.  PUCK. How now, spirit! Whither wander you?  FAIRY     Over hill, over dale,         Thorough bush, thorough brier,     Over park, over pale,         Thorough flood, thorough fire,     I do wander everywhere,     Swifter than the moon’s sphere;     And I serve the Fairy Queen,     To dew her orbs upon the green.     The cowslips tall her pensioners be,     In their gold coats spots you see;     Those be rubies, fairy favours,     In those freckles live their savours. I must go seek some dew-drops here, And hang a pearl in every cowslip’s ear. Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I’ll be gone. Our Queen and all her elves come here anon.  PUCK. The King doth keep his revels here tonight; Take heed the Queen come not within his sight, For Oberon is passing fell and wrath, Because that she, as her attendant, hath A lovely boy, stol’n from an Indian king; She never had so sweet a changeling. And jealous Oberon would have the child Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild: But she perforce withholds the lovèd boy, Crowns him with flowers, and makes him all her joy. And now they never meet in grove or green, By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen, But they do square; that all their elves for fear Creep into acorn cups, and hide them there.  FAIRY Either I mistake your shape and making quite, Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite Call’d Robin Goodfellow. Are not you he That frights the maidens of the villagery, Skim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern, And bootless make the breathless housewife churn, And sometime make the drink to bear no barm, Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm? Those that Hobgoblin call you, and sweet Puck, You do their work, and they shall have good luck. Are not you he?  PUCK. Thou speak’st aright; I am that merry wanderer of the night. I jest to Oberon, and make him smile, When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile, Neighing in likeness of a filly foal; And sometime lurk I in a gossip’s bowl In very likeness of a roasted crab, And, when she drinks, against her lips I bob, And on her withered dewlap pour the ale. The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale, Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me; Then slip I from her bum, down topples she, And ‘tailor’ cries, and falls into a cough; And then the whole quire hold their hips and loffe And waxen in their mirth, and neeze, and swear A merrier hour was never wasted there. But room, fairy. Here comes Oberon.  FAIRY And here my mistress. Would that he were gone!   Enter Oberon at one door, with his Train, and Titania at another, with  hers.  OBERON. Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.  TITANIA. What, jealous Oberon! Fairies, skip hence; I have forsworn his bed and company.  OBERON. Tarry, rash wanton; am not I thy lord?  TITANIA. Then I must be thy lady; but I know When thou hast stol’n away from fairyland, And in the shape of Corin sat all day Playing on pipes of corn, and versing love To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here, Come from the farthest steep of India, But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon, Your buskin’d mistress and your warrior love, To Theseus must be wedded; and you come To give their bed joy and prosperity?  OBERON. How canst thou thus, for shame, Titania, Glance at my credit with Hippolyta, Knowing I know thy love to Theseus? Didst not thou lead him through the glimmering night From Perigenia, whom he ravished? And make him with fair Aegles break his faith, With Ariadne and Antiopa?  TITANIA. These are the forgeries of jealousy: And never, since the middle summer’s spring, Met we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead, By pavèd fountain, or by rushy brook, Or on the beachèd margent of the sea, To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind, But with thy brawls thou hast disturb’d our sport. Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain, As in revenge, have suck’d up from the sea Contagious fogs; which, falling in the land, Hath every pelting river made so proud That they have overborne their continents. The ox hath therefore stretch’d his yoke in vain, The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn Hath rotted ere his youth attain’d a beard. The fold stands empty in the drownèd field, And crows are fatted with the murrion flock; The nine-men’s-morris is fill’d up with mud, And the quaint mazes in the wanton green, For lack of tread, are undistinguishable. The human mortals want their winter here. No night is now with hymn or carol blest. Therefore the moon, the governess of floods, Pale in her anger, washes all the air, That rheumatic diseases do abound. And thorough this distemperature we see The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose; And on old Hiems’ thin and icy crown An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds Is, as in mockery, set. The spring, the summer, The childing autumn, angry winter, change Their wonted liveries; and the mazed world, By their increase, now knows not which is which. And this same progeny of evils comes From our debate, from our dissension; We are their parents and original.  OBERON. Do you amend it, then. It lies in you. Why should Titania cross her Oberon? I do but beg a little changeling boy To be my henchman.  TITANIA. Set your heart at rest; The fairyland buys not the child of me. His mother was a vot’ress of my order, And in the spicèd Indian air, by night, Full often hath she gossip’d by my side; And sat with me on Neptune’s yellow sands, Marking th’ embarkèd traders on the flood, When we have laugh’d to see the sails conceive, And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind; Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait Following (her womb then rich with my young squire), Would imitate, and sail upon the land, To fetch me trifles, and return again, As from a voyage, rich with merchandise. But she, being mortal, of that boy did die; And for her sake do I rear up her boy, And for her sake I will not part with him.  OBERON. How long within this wood intend you stay?  TITANIA. Perchance till after Theseus’ wedding-day. If you will patiently dance in our round, And see our moonlight revels, go with us; If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.  OBERON. Give me that boy and I will go with thee.  TITANIA. Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away. We shall chide downright if I longer stay.   [_Exit Titania with her Train._]  OBERON. Well, go thy way. Thou shalt not from this grove Till I torment thee for this injury.— My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememb’rest Since once I sat upon a promontory, And heard a mermaid on a dolphin’s back Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath That the rude sea grew civil at her song And certain stars shot madly from their spheres To hear the sea-maid’s music.  PUCK. I remember.  OBERON. That very time I saw, (but thou couldst not), Flying between the cold moon and the earth, Cupid all arm’d: a certain aim he took At a fair vestal, thronèd by the west, And loos’d his love-shaft smartly from his bow As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts. But I might see young Cupid’s fiery shaft Quench’d in the chaste beams of the watery moon; And the imperial votress passed on, In maiden meditation, fancy-free. Yet mark’d I where the bolt of Cupid fell: It fell upon a little western flower, Before milk-white, now purple with love’s wound, And maidens call it love-in-idleness. Fetch me that flower, the herb I showed thee once: The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid Will make or man or woman madly dote Upon the next live creature that it sees. Fetch me this herb, and be thou here again Ere the leviathan can swim a league.  PUCK. I’ll put a girdle round about the earth In forty minutes.   [_Exit Puck._]  OBERON. Having once this juice, I’ll watch Titania when she is asleep, And drop the liquor of it in her eyes: The next thing then she waking looks upon (Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull, On meddling monkey, or on busy ape) She shall pursue it with the soul of love. And ere I take this charm from off her sight (As I can take it with another herb) I’ll make her render up her page to me. But who comes here? I am invisible; And I will overhear their conference.   Enter Demetrius, Helena following him.  DEMETRIUS. I love thee not, therefore pursue me not. Where is Lysander and fair Hermia? The one I’ll slay, the other slayeth me. Thou told’st me they were stol’n into this wood, And here am I, and wode within this wood Because I cannot meet with Hermia. Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.  HELENA. You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant, But yet you draw not iron, for my heart Is true as steel. Leave you your power to draw, And I shall have no power to follow you.  DEMETRIUS. Do I entice you? Do I speak you fair? Or rather do I not in plainest truth Tell you I do not, nor I cannot love you?  HELENA. And even for that do I love you the more. I am your spaniel; and, Demetrius, The more you beat me, I will fawn on you. Use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me, Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave, Unworthy as I am, to follow you. What worser place can I beg in your love, (And yet a place of high respect with me) Than to be usèd as you use your dog?  DEMETRIUS. Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit; For I am sick when I do look on thee.  HELENA. And I am sick when I look not on you.  DEMETRIUS. You do impeach your modesty too much To leave the city and commit yourself Into the hands of one that loves you not, To trust the opportunity of night And the ill counsel of a desert place, With the rich worth of your virginity.  HELENA. Your virtue is my privilege: for that It is not night when I do see your face, Therefore I think I am not in the night; Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company, For you, in my respect, are all the world. Then how can it be said I am alone When all the world is here to look on me?  DEMETRIUS. I’ll run from thee and hide me in the brakes, And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.  HELENA. The wildest hath not such a heart as you. Run when you will, the story shall be chang’d; Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase; The dove pursues the griffin, the mild hind Makes speed to catch the tiger. Bootless speed, When cowardice pursues and valour flies!  DEMETRIUS. I will not stay thy questions. Let me go, Or if thou follow me, do not believe But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.  HELENA. Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field, You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius! Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex. We cannot fight for love as men may do. We should be woo’d, and were not made to woo.   [_Exit Demetrius._]  I’ll follow thee, and make a heaven of hell, To die upon the hand I love so well.   [_Exit Helena._]  OBERON. Fare thee well, nymph. Ere he do leave this grove, Thou shalt fly him, and he shall seek thy love.   Enter Puck.  Hast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer.  PUCK. Ay, there it is.  OBERON. I pray thee give it me. I know a bank where the wild thyme blows, Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows, Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine, With sweet musk-roses, and with eglantine. There sleeps Titania sometime of the night, Lull’d in these flowers with dances and delight; And there the snake throws her enamell’d skin, Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in. And with the juice of this I’ll streak her eyes, And make her full of hateful fantasies. Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove: A sweet Athenian lady is in love With a disdainful youth. Anoint his eyes; But do it when the next thing he espies May be the lady. Thou shalt know the man By the Athenian garments he hath on. Effect it with some care, that he may prove More fond on her than she upon her love: And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.  PUCK. Fear not, my lord, your servant shall do so.   [_Exeunt._]
  ACT III  SCENE I. The Wood.
 The Queen of Fairies still lying asleep.   Enter Bottom, Quince, Snout, Starveling, Snug and Flute.  BOTTOM. Are we all met?  QUINCE. Pat, pat; and here’s a marvellous convenient place for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be our stage, this hawthorn brake our tiring-house; and we will do it in action, as we will do it before the Duke.  BOTTOM. Peter Quince?  QUINCE. What sayest thou, bully Bottom?  BOTTOM. There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisbe that will never please. First, Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself; which the ladies cannot abide. How answer you that?  SNOUT By’r lakin, a parlous fear.  STARVELING. I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.  BOTTOM. Not a whit; I have a device to make all well. Write me a prologue, and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm with our swords, and that Pyramus is not killed indeed; and for the more better assurance, tell them that I Pyramus am not Pyramus but Bottom the weaver. This will put them out of fear.  QUINCE. Well, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be written in eight and six.  BOTTOM. No, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.  SNOUT Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?  STARVELING. I fear it, I promise you.  BOTTOM. Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves, to bring in (God shield us!) a lion among ladies is a most dreadful thing. For there is not a more fearful wild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought to look to it.  SNOUT Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.  BOTTOM. Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must be seen through the lion’s neck; and he himself must speak through, saying thus, or to the same defect: ‘Ladies,’ or, ‘Fair ladies, I would wish you,’ or, ‘I would request you,’ or, ’I would entreat you, not to fear, not to tremble: my life for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it were pity of my life. No, I am no such thing; I am a man as other men are’: and there, indeed, let him name his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.  QUINCE. Well, it shall be so. But there is two hard things: that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber, for you know, Pyramus and Thisbe meet by moonlight.  SNOUT Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?  BOTTOM. A calendar, a calendar! Look in the almanack; find out moonshine, find out moonshine.  QUINCE. Yes, it doth shine that night.  BOTTOM. Why, then may you leave a casement of the great chamber window, where we play, open; and the moon may shine in at the casement.  QUINCE. Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a lantern, and say he comes to disfigure or to present the person of Moonshine. Then there is another thing: we must have a wall in the great chamber; for Pyramus and Thisbe, says the story, did talk through the chink of a wall.  SNOUT You can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?  BOTTOM. Some man or other must present Wall. And let him have some plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast about him, to signify wall; and let him hold his fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus and Thisbe whisper.  QUINCE. If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down, every mother’s son, and rehearse your parts. Pyramus, you begin: when you have spoken your speech, enter into that brake; and so everyone according to his cue.   Enter Puck behind.  PUCK. What hempen homespuns have we swaggering here, So near the cradle of the Fairy Queen? What, a play toward? I’ll be an auditor; An actor too perhaps, if I see cause.  QUINCE. Speak, Pyramus.—Thisbe, stand forth.  PYRAMUS. _Thisbe, the flowers of odious savours sweet_  QUINCE. Odours, odours.  PYRAMUS. _. . . odours savours sweet. So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisbe dear. But hark, a voice! Stay thou but here awhile, And by and by I will to thee appear._   [_Exit._]  PUCK. A stranger Pyramus than e’er played here!   [_Exit._]  THISBE. Must I speak now?  QUINCE. Ay, marry, must you, For you must understand he goes but to see a noise that he heard, and is to come again.  THISBE. _Most radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue, Of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier, Most brisky juvenal, and eke most lovely Jew, As true as truest horse, that yet would never tire, I’ll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny’s tomb._  QUINCE. Ninus’ tomb, man! Why, you must not speak that yet. That you answer to Pyramus. You speak all your part at once, cues, and all.—Pyramus enter! Your cue is past; it is ‘never tire.’  THISBE. O, _As true as truest horse, that yet would never tire._   Enter Puck and Bottom with an ass’s head.  PYRAMUS. _If I were fair, Thisbe, I were only thine._  QUINCE. O monstrous! O strange! We are haunted. Pray, masters, fly, masters! Help!   [_Exeunt Clowns._]  PUCK. I’ll follow you. I’ll lead you about a round,    Through bog, through bush, through brake, through brier; Sometime a horse I’ll be, sometime a hound,    A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire; And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn, Like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn.   [_Exit._]  BOTTOM. Why do they run away? This is a knavery of them to make me afeard.   Enter Snout.  SNOUT O Bottom, thou art changed! What do I see on thee?  BOTTOM. What do you see? You see an ass-head of your own, do you?   [_Exit Snout._]   Enter Quince.  QUINCE. Bless thee, Bottom! bless thee! Thou art translated.   [_Exit._]  BOTTOM. I see their knavery. This is to make an ass of me, to fright me, if they could. But I will not stir from this place, do what they can. I will walk up and down here, and I will sing, that they shall hear I am not afraid. [_Sings._]        The ousel cock, so black of hue,           With orange-tawny bill,        The throstle with his note so true,           The wren with little quill.  TITANIA. [_Waking._] What angel wakes me from my flowery bed?  BOTTOM. [_Sings._]        The finch, the sparrow, and the lark,           The plain-song cuckoo gray,        Whose note full many a man doth mark,           And dares not answer nay. for, indeed, who would set his wit to so foolish a bird? Who would give a bird the lie, though he cry ‘cuckoo’ never so?  TITANIA. I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again. Mine ear is much enamour’d of thy note. So is mine eye enthrallèd to thy shape; And thy fair virtue’s force perforce doth move me, On the first view, to say, to swear, I love thee.  BOTTOM. Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason for that. And yet, to say the truth, reason and love keep little company together nowadays. The more the pity that some honest neighbours will not make them friends. Nay, I can gleek upon occasion.  TITANIA. Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.  BOTTOM. Not so, neither; but if I had wit enough to get out of this wood, I have enough to serve mine own turn.  TITANIA. Out of this wood do not desire to go. Thou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no. I am a spirit of no common rate. The summer still doth tend upon my state; And I do love thee: therefore, go with me. I’ll give thee fairies to attend on thee; And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep, And sing, while thou on pressèd flowers dost sleep. And I will purge thy mortal grossness so That thou shalt like an airy spirit go.— Peaseblossom! Cobweb! Moth! and Mustardseed!   Enter four Fairies.  PEASEBLOSSOM. Ready.
COBWEB. And I.
MOTH. And I.
MUSTARDSEED. And I.
ALL. Where shall we go?  TITANIA. Be kind and courteous to this gentleman; Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes; Feed him with apricocks and dewberries, With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries; The honey-bags steal from the humble-bees, And for night-tapers, crop their waxen thighs, And light them at the fiery glow-worm’s eyes, To have my love to bed and to arise; And pluck the wings from painted butterflies, To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes. Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.
PEASEBLOSSOM. Hail, mortal!
COBWEB. Hail!
MOTH. Hail!
MUSTARDSEED. Hail!  BOTTOM. I cry your worships mercy, heartily.—I beseech your worship’s name.  COBWEB. Cobweb.  BOTTOM. I shall desire you of more acquaintance, good Master Cobweb. If I cut my finger, I shall make bold with you.—Your name, honest gentleman?  PEASEBLOSSOM. Peaseblossom.  BOTTOM. I pray you, commend me to Mistress Squash, your mother, and to Master Peascod, your father. Good Master Peaseblossom, I shall desire you of more acquaintance too.—Your name, I beseech you, sir?  MUSTARDSEED. Mustardseed.  BOTTOM. Good Master Mustardseed, I know your patience well. That same cowardly giant-like ox-beef hath devoured many a gentleman of your house. I promise you, your kindred hath made my eyes water ere now. I desire you of more acquaintance, good Master Mustardseed.  TITANIA. Come, wait upon him; lead him to my bower.    The moon, methinks, looks with a watery eye, And when she weeps, weeps every little flower,    Lamenting some enforced chastity. Tie up my love’s tongue, bring him silently.   [_Exeunt._]
SCENE II. Another part of the wood   Enter Oberon.  OBERON. I wonder if Titania be awak’d; Then, what it was that next came in her eye, Which she must dote on in extremity.   Enter Puck.  Here comes my messenger. How now, mad spirit? What night-rule now about this haunted grove?  PUCK. My mistress with a monster is in love. Near to her close and consecrated bower, While she was in her dull and sleeping hour, A crew of patches, rude mechanicals, That work for bread upon Athenian stalls, Were met together to rehearse a play Intended for great Theseus’ nuptial day. The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort Who Pyramus presented in their sport, Forsook his scene and enter’d in a brake. When I did him at this advantage take, An ass’s nole I fixed on his head. Anon, his Thisbe must be answerèd, And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy, As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye, Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort, Rising and cawing at the gun’s report, Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky, So at his sight away his fellows fly, And at our stamp, here o’er and o’er one falls; He murder cries, and help from Athens calls. Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears, thus strong, Made senseless things begin to do them wrong; For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch; Some sleeves, some hats, from yielders all things catch. I led them on in this distracted fear, And left sweet Pyramus translated there. When in that moment, so it came to pass, Titania wak’d, and straightway lov’d an ass.  OBERON. This falls out better than I could devise. But hast thou yet latch’d the Athenian’s eyes With the love-juice, as I did bid thee do?  PUCK. I took him sleeping—that is finish’d too— And the Athenian woman by his side, That, when he wak’d, of force she must be ey’d.   Enter Demetrius and Hermia.  OBERON. Stand close. This is the same Athenian.  PUCK. This is the woman, but not this the man.  DEMETRIUS. O why rebuke you him that loves you so? Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe.  HERMIA. Now I but chide, but I should use thee worse, For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse. If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep, Being o’er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep, And kill me too. The sun was not so true unto the day As he to me. Would he have stol’n away From sleeping Hermia? I’ll believe as soon This whole earth may be bor’d, and that the moon May through the centre creep and so displease Her brother’s noontide with th’ Antipodes. It cannot be but thou hast murder’d him. So should a murderer look, so dead, so grim.  DEMETRIUS. So should the murder’d look, and so should I, Pierc’d through the heart with your stern cruelty. Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear, As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.  HERMIA. What’s this to my Lysander? Where is he? Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?  DEMETRIUS. I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.  HERMIA. Out, dog! Out, cur! Thou driv’st me past the bounds Of maiden’s patience. Hast thou slain him, then? Henceforth be never number’d among men! O once tell true; tell true, even for my sake! Durst thou have look’d upon him, being awake, And hast thou kill’d him sleeping? O brave touch! Could not a worm, an adder, do so much? An adder did it; for with doubler tongue Than thine, thou serpent, never adder stung.  DEMETRIUS. You spend your passion on a mispris’d mood: I am not guilty of Lysander’s blood; Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell.  HERMIA. I pray thee, tell me then that he is well.  DEMETRIUS. And if I could, what should I get therefore?  HERMIA. A privilege never to see me more. And from thy hated presence part I so: See me no more, whether he be dead or no.   [_Exit._]  DEMETRIUS. There is no following her in this fierce vein. Here, therefore, for a while I will remain. So sorrow’s heaviness doth heavier grow For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe; Which now in some slight measure it will pay, If for his tender here I make some stay.   [_Lies down._]  OBERON. What hast thou done? Thou hast mistaken quite, And laid the love-juice on some true-love’s sight. Of thy misprision must perforce ensue Some true love turn’d, and not a false turn’d true.  PUCK. Then fate o’er-rules, that, one man holding troth, A million fail, confounding oath on oath.  OBERON. About the wood go swifter than the wind, And Helena of Athens look thou find. All fancy-sick she is, and pale of cheer With sighs of love, that costs the fresh blood dear. By some illusion see thou bring her here; I’ll charm his eyes against she do appear.  PUCK. I go, I go; look how I go, Swifter than arrow from the Tartar’s bow.   [_Exit._]  OBERON.     Flower of this purple dye,     Hit with Cupid’s archery,     Sink in apple of his eye.     When his love he doth espy,     Let her shine as gloriously     As the Venus of the sky.—     When thou wak’st, if she be by,     Beg of her for remedy.   Enter Puck.  PUCK.     Captain of our fairy band,     Helena is here at hand,     And the youth mistook by me,     Pleading for a lover’s fee.     Shall we their fond pageant see?     Lord, what fools these mortals be!  OBERON.     Stand aside. The noise they make     Will cause Demetrius to awake.  PUCK.     Then will two at once woo one.     That must needs be sport alone;     And those things do best please me     That befall prepost’rously.   Enter Lysander and Helena.  LYSANDER. Why should you think that I should woo in scorn? Scorn and derision never come in tears. Look when I vow, I weep; and vows so born, In their nativity all truth appears. How can these things in me seem scorn to you, Bearing the badge of faith, to prove them true?  HELENA. You do advance your cunning more and more. When truth kills truth, O devilish-holy fray! These vows are Hermia’s: will you give her o’er? Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh: Your vows to her and me, put in two scales, Will even weigh; and both as light as tales.  LYSANDER. I had no judgment when to her I swore.  HELENA. Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o’er.  LYSANDER. Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you.  DEMETRIUS. [_Waking._] O Helen, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine! To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne? Crystal is muddy. O how ripe in show Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow! That pure congealèd white, high Taurus’ snow, Fann’d with the eastern wind, turns to a crow When thou hold’st up thy hand. O, let me kiss This princess of pure white, this seal of bliss!  HELENA. O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent To set against me for your merriment. If you were civil, and knew courtesy, You would not do me thus much injury. Can you not hate me, as I know you do, But you must join in souls to mock me too? If you were men, as men you are in show, You would not use a gentle lady so; To vow, and swear, and superpraise my parts, When I am sure you hate me with your hearts. You both are rivals, and love Hermia; And now both rivals, to mock Helena. A trim exploit, a manly enterprise, To conjure tears up in a poor maid’s eyes With your derision! None of noble sort Would so offend a virgin, and extort A poor soul’s patience, all to make you sport.  LYSANDER. You are unkind, Demetrius; be not so, For you love Hermia; this you know I know. And here, with all good will, with all my heart, In Hermia’s love I yield you up my part; And yours of Helena to me bequeath, Whom I do love and will do till my death.  HELENA. Never did mockers waste more idle breath.  DEMETRIUS. Lysander, keep thy Hermia; I will none. If e’er I lov’d her, all that love is gone. My heart to her but as guest-wise sojourn’d; And now to Helen is it home return’d, There to remain.  LYSANDER. Helen, it is not so.  DEMETRIUS. Disparage not the faith thou dost not know, Lest to thy peril thou aby it dear. Look where thy love comes; yonder is thy dear.   Enter Hermia.  HERMIA. Dark night, that from the eye his function takes, The ear more quick of apprehension makes; Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense, It pays the hearing double recompense. Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found; Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound. But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?  LYSANDER. Why should he stay whom love doth press to go?  HERMIA. What love could press Lysander from my side?  LYSANDER. Lysander’s love, that would not let him bide, Fair Helena, who more engilds the night Than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light. Why seek’st thou me? Could not this make thee know The hate I bare thee made me leave thee so?  HERMIA. You speak not as you think; it cannot be.  HELENA. Lo, she is one of this confederacy! Now I perceive they have conjoin’d all three To fashion this false sport in spite of me. Injurious Hermia, most ungrateful maid! Have you conspir’d, have you with these contriv’d, To bait me with this foul derision? Is all the counsel that we two have shar’d, The sisters’ vows, the hours that we have spent, When we have chid the hasty-footed time For parting us—O, is all forgot? All school-days’ friendship, childhood innocence? We, Hermia, like two artificial gods, Have with our needles created both one flower, Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion, Both warbling of one song, both in one key, As if our hands, our sides, voices, and minds, Had been incorporate. So we grew together, Like to a double cherry, seeming parted, But yet a union in partition, Two lovely berries moulded on one stem; So, with two seeming bodies, but one heart; Two of the first, like coats in heraldry, Due but to one, and crownèd with one crest. And will you rent our ancient love asunder, To join with men in scorning your poor friend? It is not friendly, ’tis not maidenly. Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it, Though I alone do feel the injury.  HERMIA. I am amazèd at your passionate words: I scorn you not; it seems that you scorn me.  HELENA. Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn, To follow me, and praise my eyes and face? And made your other love, Demetrius, Who even but now did spurn me with his foot, To call me goddess, nymph, divine and rare, Precious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this To her he hates? And wherefore doth Lysander Deny your love, so rich within his soul, And tender me, forsooth, affection, But by your setting on, by your consent? What though I be not so in grace as you, So hung upon with love, so fortunate, But miserable most, to love unlov’d? This you should pity rather than despise.  HERMIA. I understand not what you mean by this.  HELENA. Ay, do. Persever, counterfeit sad looks, Make mouths upon me when I turn my back, Wink each at other; hold the sweet jest up. This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled. If you have any pity, grace, or manners, You would not make me such an argument. But fare ye well. ’Tis partly my own fault, Which death, or absence, soon shall remedy.  LYSANDER. Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse; My love, my life, my soul, fair Helena!  HELENA. O excellent!  HERMIA. Sweet, do not scorn her so.  DEMETRIUS. If she cannot entreat, I can compel.  LYSANDER. Thou canst compel no more than she entreat; Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers. Helen, I love thee, by my life I do; I swear by that which I will lose for thee To prove him false that says I love thee not.  DEMETRIUS. I say I love thee more than he can do.  LYSANDER. If thou say so, withdraw, and prove it too.  DEMETRIUS. Quick, come.  HERMIA. Lysander, whereto tends all this?  LYSANDER. Away, you Ethiope!  DEMETRIUS. No, no. He will Seem to break loose. Take on as you would follow, But yet come not. You are a tame man, go!  LYSANDER. Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! Vile thing, let loose, Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent.  HERMIA. Why are you grown so rude? What change is this, Sweet love?  LYSANDER. Thy love? Out, tawny Tartar, out! Out, loathèd medicine! O hated potion, hence!  HERMIA. Do you not jest?  HELENA. Yes, sooth, and so do you.  LYSANDER. Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee.  DEMETRIUS. I would I had your bond; for I perceive A weak bond holds you; I’ll not trust your word.  LYSANDER. What, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead? Although I hate her, I’ll not harm her so.  HERMIA. What, can you do me greater harm than hate? Hate me? Wherefore? O me! what news, my love? Am not I Hermia? Are not you Lysander? I am as fair now as I was erewhile. Since night you lov’d me; yet since night you left me. Why then, you left me—O, the gods forbid!— In earnest, shall I say?  LYSANDER. Ay, by my life; And never did desire to see thee more. Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt; Be certain, nothing truer; ’tis no jest That I do hate thee and love Helena.  HERMIA. O me! You juggler! You cankerblossom! You thief of love! What! have you come by night And stol’n my love’s heart from him?  HELENA. Fine, i’ faith! Have you no modesty, no maiden shame, No touch of bashfulness? What, will you tear Impatient answers from my gentle tongue? Fie, fie, you counterfeit, you puppet, you!  HERMIA. Puppet! Why so? Ay, that way goes the game. Now I perceive that she hath made compare Between our statures; she hath urg’d her height; And with her personage, her tall personage, Her height, forsooth, she hath prevail’d with him. And are you grown so high in his esteem Because I am so dwarfish and so low? How low am I, thou painted maypole? Speak, How low am I? I am not yet so low But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.  HELENA. I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen, Let her not hurt me. I was never curst; I have no gift at all in shrewishness; I am a right maid for my cowardice; Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think, Because she is something lower than myself, That I can match her.  HERMIA. Lower! Hark, again.  HELENA. Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me. I evermore did love you, Hermia, Did ever keep your counsels, never wrong’d you, Save that, in love unto Demetrius, I told him of your stealth unto this wood. He follow’d you; for love I follow’d him; But he hath chid me hence, and threaten’d me To strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too: And now, so you will let me quiet go, To Athens will I bear my folly back, And follow you no further. Let me go: You see how simple and how fond I am.  HERMIA. Why, get you gone. Who is’t that hinders you?  HELENA. A foolish heart that I leave here behind.  HERMIA. What! with Lysander?  HELENA. With Demetrius.  LYSANDER. Be not afraid; she shall not harm thee, Helena.  DEMETRIUS. No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.  HELENA. O, when she’s angry, she is keen and shrewd. She was a vixen when she went to school, And though she be but little, she is fierce.  HERMIA. Little again! Nothing but low and little? Why will you suffer her to flout me thus? Let me come to her.  LYSANDER. Get you gone, you dwarf; You minimus, of hind’ring knot-grass made; You bead, you acorn.  DEMETRIUS. You are too officious In her behalf that scorns your services. Let her alone. Speak not of Helena; Take not her part; for if thou dost intend Never so little show of love to her, Thou shalt aby it.  LYSANDER. Now she holds me not. Now follow, if thou dar’st, to try whose right, Of thine or mine, is most in Helena.  DEMETRIUS. Follow! Nay, I’ll go with thee, cheek by jole.   [_Exeunt Lysander and Demetrius._]  HERMIA. You, mistress, all this coil is long of you. Nay, go not back.  HELENA. I will not trust you, I, Nor longer stay in your curst company. Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray. My legs are longer though, to run away.   [_Exit._]  HERMIA. I am amaz’d, and know not what to say.   [_Exit, pursuing Helena._]  OBERON. This is thy negligence: still thou mistak’st, Or else commit’st thy knaveries willfully.  PUCK. Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook. Did not you tell me I should know the man By the Athenian garments he had on? And so far blameless proves my enterprise That I have ’nointed an Athenian’s eyes: And so far am I glad it so did sort, As this their jangling I esteem a sport.  OBERON. Thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight. Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night; The starry welkin cover thou anon With drooping fog, as black as Acheron, And lead these testy rivals so astray As one come not within another’s way. Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue, Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong; And sometime rail thou like Demetrius. And from each other look thou lead them thus, Till o’er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep. Then crush this herb into Lysander’s eye, Whose liquor hath this virtuous property, To take from thence all error with his might And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight. When they next wake, all this derision Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision; And back to Athens shall the lovers wend, With league whose date till death shall never end. Whiles I in this affair do thee employ, I’ll to my queen, and beg her Indian boy; And then I will her charmèd eye release From monster’s view, and all things shall be peace.  PUCK. My fairy lord, this must be done with haste, For night’s swift dragons cut the clouds full fast; And yonder shines Aurora’s harbinger, At whose approach, ghosts wandering here and there Troop home to churchyards. Damnèd spirits all, That in cross-ways and floods have burial, Already to their wormy beds are gone; For fear lest day should look their shames upon, They wilfully themselves exile from light, And must for aye consort with black-brow’d night.  OBERON. But we are spirits of another sort: I with the morning’s love have oft made sport; And, like a forester, the groves may tread Even till the eastern gate, all fiery-red, Opening on Neptune with fair blessèd beams, Turns into yellow gold his salt-green streams. But, notwithstanding, haste, make no delay. We may effect this business yet ere day.   [_Exit Oberon._]  PUCK.     Up and down, up and down,     I will lead them up and down.     I am fear’d in field and town.     Goblin, lead them up and down. Here comes one.   Enter Lysander.  LYSANDER. Where art thou, proud Demetrius? Speak thou now.  PUCK. Here, villain, drawn and ready. Where art thou?  LYSANDER. I will be with thee straight.  PUCK. Follow me then to plainer ground.   [_Exit Lysander as following the voice._]   Enter Demetrius.  DEMETRIUS. Lysander, speak again. Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled? Speak. In some bush? Where dost thou hide thy head?  PUCK. Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars, Telling the bushes that thou look’st for wars, And wilt not come? Come, recreant, come, thou child! I’ll whip thee with a rod. He is defil’d That draws a sword on thee.  DEMETRIUS. Yea, art thou there?  PUCK. Follow my voice; we’ll try no manhood here.   [_Exeunt._]   Enter Lysander.  LYSANDER. He goes before me, and still dares me on; When I come where he calls, then he is gone. The villain is much lighter-heel’d than I: I follow’d fast, but faster he did fly, That fallen am I in dark uneven way, And here will rest me.  Come, thou gentle day! [_Lies down._] For if but once thou show me thy grey light, I’ll find Demetrius, and revenge this spite.   [_Sleeps._]   Enter Puck and Demetrius.  PUCK. Ho, ho, ho! Coward, why com’st thou not?  DEMETRIUS. Abide me, if thou dar’st; for well I wot Thou runn’st before me, shifting every place, And dar’st not stand, nor look me in the face. Where art thou?  PUCK. Come hither; I am here.  DEMETRIUS. Nay, then, thou mock’st me. Thou shalt buy this dear If ever I thy face by daylight see: Now go thy way. Faintness constraineth me To measure out my length on this cold bed. By day’s approach look to be visited.   [_Lies down and sleeps._]   Enter Helena.  HELENA. O weary night, O long and tedious night,     Abate thy hours! Shine, comforts, from the east, That I may back to Athens by daylight,     From these that my poor company detest. And sleep, that sometimes shuts up sorrow’s eye, Steal me awhile from mine own company.   [_Sleeps._]  PUCK.     Yet but three? Come one more.     Two of both kinds makes up four.     Here she comes, curst and sad.     Cupid is a knavish lad     Thus to make poor females mad.   Enter Hermia.  HERMIA. Never so weary, never so in woe,    Bedabbled with the dew, and torn with briers, I can no further crawl, no further go;    My legs can keep no pace with my desires. Here will I rest me till the break of day. Heavens shield Lysander, if they mean a fray!   [_Lies down._]  PUCK.          On the ground          Sleep sound.          I’ll apply          To your eye,        Gentle lover, remedy.   [_Squeezing the juice on Lysander’s eye._]           When thou wak’st,          Thou tak’st          True delight          In the sight        Of thy former lady’s eye.        And the country proverb known,        That every man should take his own,        In your waking shall be shown:          Jack shall have Jill;          Nought shall go ill; The man shall have his mare again, and all shall be well.   [_Exit Puck._]
  ACT IV  SCENE I. The Wood
 Lysander, Demetrius, Helena and Hermia still asleep.   Enter Titania and Bottom; Peaseblossom, Cobweb, Moth, Mustardseed and  other Fairies attending; Oberon behind, unseen.  TITANIA. Come, sit thee down upon this flowery bed,    While I thy amiable cheeks do coy, And stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head,    And kiss thy fair large ears, my gentle joy.  BOTTOM. Where’s Peaseblossom?  PEASEBLOSSOM. Ready.  BOTTOM. Scratch my head, Peaseblossom. Where’s Monsieur Cobweb?  COBWEB. Ready.  BOTTOM. Monsieur Cobweb; good monsieur, get you your weapons in your hand and kill me a red-hipped humble-bee on the top of a thistle; and, good monsieur, bring me the honey-bag. Do not fret yourself too much in the action, monsieur; and, good monsieur, have a care the honey-bag break not; I would be loath to have you overflown with a honey-bag, signior. Where’s Monsieur Mustardseed?  MUSTARDSEED. Ready.  BOTTOM. Give me your neaf, Monsieur Mustardseed. Pray you, leave your courtesy, good monsieur.  MUSTARDSEED. What’s your will?  BOTTOM. Nothing, good monsieur, but to help Cavalery Cobweb to scratch. I must to the barber’s, monsieur, for methinks I am marvellous hairy about the face; and I am such a tender ass, if my hair do but tickle me, I must scratch.  TITANIA. What, wilt thou hear some music, my sweet love?  BOTTOM. I have a reasonable good ear in music. Let us have the tongs and the bones.
TITANIA. Or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat.  BOTTOM. Truly, a peck of provender; I could munch your good dry oats. Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle of hay: good hay, sweet hay, hath no fellow.  TITANIA. I have a venturous fairy that shall seek The squirrel’s hoard, and fetch thee new nuts.  BOTTOM. I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas. But, I pray you, let none of your people stir me; I have an exposition of sleep come upon me.  TITANIA. Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms. Fairies, be gone, and be all ways away. So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle Gently entwist, the female ivy so Enrings the barky fingers of the elm. O, how I love thee! How I dote on thee!   [_They sleep._]   Oberon advances. Enter Puck.  OBERON. Welcome, good Robin. Seest thou this sweet sight? Her dotage now I do begin to pity. For, meeting her of late behind the wood, Seeking sweet favours for this hateful fool, I did upbraid her and fall out with her: For she his hairy temples then had rounded With coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers; And that same dew, which sometime on the buds Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls, Stood now within the pretty flouriets’ eyes, Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail. When I had at my pleasure taunted her, And she in mild terms begg’d my patience, I then did ask of her her changeling child; Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent To bear him to my bower in fairyland. And now I have the boy, I will undo This hateful imperfection of her eyes. And, gentle Puck, take this transformèd scalp From off the head of this Athenian swain, That he awaking when the other do, May all to Athens back again repair, And think no more of this night’s accidents But as the fierce vexation of a dream. But first I will release the Fairy Queen.   [_Touching her eyes with an herb._]      Be as thou wast wont to be;     See as thou was wont to see.     Dian’s bud o’er Cupid’s flower     Hath such force and blessed power. Now, my Titania, wake you, my sweet queen.  TITANIA. My Oberon, what visions have I seen! Methought I was enamour’d of an ass.  OBERON. There lies your love.  TITANIA. How came these things to pass? O, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!  OBERON. Silence awhile.—Robin, take off this head. Titania, music call; and strike more dead Than common sleep, of all these five the sense.  TITANIA. Music, ho, music, such as charmeth sleep.  PUCK. Now when thou wak’st, with thine own fool’s eyes peep.  OBERON. Sound, music.   [_Still music._]  Come, my queen, take hands with me, And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be. Now thou and I are new in amity, And will tomorrow midnight solemnly Dance in Duke Theseus’ house triumphantly, And bless it to all fair prosperity: There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be Wedded, with Theseus, all in jollity.  PUCK.     Fairy king, attend and mark.     I do hear the morning lark.  OBERON.     Then, my queen, in silence sad,     Trip we after night’s shade.     We the globe can compass soon,     Swifter than the wand’ring moon.  TITANIA.     Come, my lord, and in our flight,     Tell me how it came this night     That I sleeping here was found     With these mortals on the ground.   [_Exeunt. Horns sound within._]   Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Egeus and Train.  THESEUS. Go, one of you, find out the forester; For now our observation is perform’d; And since we have the vaward of the day, My love shall hear the music of my hounds. Uncouple in the western valley; let them go. Dispatch I say, and find the forester.   [_Exit an Attendant._]  We will, fair queen, up to the mountain’s top, And mark the musical confusion Of hounds and echo in conjunction.  HIPPOLYTA. I was with Hercules and Cadmus once, When in a wood of Crete they bay’d the bear With hounds of Sparta. Never did I hear Such gallant chiding; for, besides the groves, The skies, the fountains, every region near Seem’d all one mutual cry. I never heard So musical a discord, such sweet thunder.  THESEUS. My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind, So flew’d, so sanded; and their heads are hung With ears that sweep away the morning dew; Crook-knee’d and dewlap’d like Thessalian bulls; Slow in pursuit, but match’d in mouth like bells, Each under each. A cry more tuneable Was never holla’d to, nor cheer’d with horn, In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly. Judge when you hear.—But, soft, what nymphs are these?  EGEUS. My lord, this is my daughter here asleep, And this Lysander; this Demetrius is; This Helena, old Nedar’s Helena: I wonder of their being here together.  THESEUS. No doubt they rose up early to observe The rite of May; and, hearing our intent, Came here in grace of our solemnity. But speak, Egeus; is not this the day That Hermia should give answer of her choice?  EGEUS. It is, my lord.  THESEUS. Go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.   Horns, and shout within. Demetrius, Lysander, Hermia and Helena wake  and start up.  Good morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past. Begin these wood-birds but to couple now?  LYSANDER. Pardon, my lord.   He and the rest kneel to  Theseus.  THESEUS. I pray you all, stand up. I know you two are rival enemies. How comes this gentle concord in the world, That hatred is so far from jealousy To sleep by hate, and fear no enmity?  LYSANDER. My lord, I shall reply amazedly, Half sleep, half waking; but as yet, I swear, I cannot truly say how I came here. But, as I think (for truly would I speak) And now I do bethink me, so it is: I came with Hermia hither. Our intent Was to be gone from Athens, where we might be Without the peril of the Athenian law.  EGEUS. Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough. I beg the law, the law upon his head. They would have stol’n away, they would, Demetrius, Thereby to have defeated you and me: You of your wife, and me of my consent, Of my consent that she should be your wife.  DEMETRIUS. My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth, Of this their purpose hither to this wood; And I in fury hither follow’d them, Fair Helena in fancy following me. But, my good lord, I wot not by what power, (But by some power it is) my love to Hermia, Melted as the snow, seems to me now As the remembrance of an idle gaud Which in my childhood I did dote upon; And all the faith, the virtue of my heart, The object and the pleasure of mine eye, Is only Helena. To her, my lord, Was I betroth’d ere I saw Hermia. But like a sickness did I loathe this food. But, as in health, come to my natural taste, Now I do wish it, love it, long for it, And will for evermore be true to it.  THESEUS. Fair lovers, you are fortunately met. Of this discourse we more will hear anon. Egeus, I will overbear your will; For in the temple, by and by with us, These couples shall eternally be knit. And, for the morning now is something worn, Our purpos’d hunting shall be set aside. Away with us to Athens. Three and three, We’ll hold a feast in great solemnity. Come, Hippolyta.   [_Exeunt Theseus, Hippolyta, Egeus and Train._]  DEMETRIUS. These things seem small and undistinguishable, Like far-off mountains turnèd into clouds.  HERMIA. Methinks I see these things with parted eye, When everything seems double.  HELENA. So methinks. And I have found Demetrius like a jewel, Mine own, and not mine own.  DEMETRIUS. Are you sure That we are awake? It seems to me That yet we sleep, we dream. Do not you think The Duke was here, and bid us follow him?  HERMIA. Yea, and my father.  HELENA. And Hippolyta.  LYSANDER. And he did bid us follow to the temple.  DEMETRIUS. Why, then, we are awake: let’s follow him, And by the way let us recount our dreams.   [_Exeunt._]  BOTTOM. [_Waking._] When my cue comes, call me, and I will answer. My next is ‘Most fair Pyramus.’ Heigh-ho! Peter Quince! Flute, the bellows-mender! Snout, the tinker! Starveling! God’s my life! Stol’n hence, and left me asleep! I have had a most rare vision. I have had a dream, past the wit of man to say what dream it was. Man is but an ass if he go about to expound this dream. Methought I was—there is no man can tell what. Methought I was, and methought I had—but man is but a patched fool if he will offer to say what methought I had. The eye of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen, man’s hand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceive, nor his heart to report, what my dream was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this dream: it shall be called ‘Bottom’s Dream’, because it hath no bottom; and I will sing it in the latter end of a play, before the Duke. Peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shall sing it at her death.   [_Exit._]
SCENE II. Athens. A Room in Quince’s House   Enter Quince, Flute, Snout and Starveling.  QUINCE. Have you sent to Bottom’s house? Is he come home yet?  STARVELING. He cannot be heard of. Out of doubt he is transported.  FLUTE. If he come not, then the play is marred. It goes not forward, doth it?  QUINCE. It is not possible. You have not a man in all Athens able to discharge Pyramus but he.  FLUTE. No, he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in Athens.  QUINCE. Yea, and the best person too, and he is a very paramour for a sweet voice.
FLUTE. You must say paragon. A paramour is, God bless us, a thing of naught.   Enter Snug.  SNUG Masters, the Duke is coming from the temple, and there is two or three lords and ladies more married. If our sport had gone forward, we had all been made men.  FLUTE. O sweet bully Bottom! Thus hath he lost sixpence a day during his life; he could not have ’scaped sixpence a day. An the Duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I’ll be hanged. He would have deserved it: sixpence a day in Pyramus, or nothing.   Enter Bottom.  BOTTOM. Where are these lads? Where are these hearts?  QUINCE. Bottom! O most courageous day! O most happy hour!  BOTTOM. Masters, I am to discourse wonders: but ask me not what; for if I tell you, I am not true Athenian. I will tell you everything, right as it fell out.  QUINCE. Let us hear, sweet Bottom.  BOTTOM. Not a word of me. All that I will tell you is, that the Duke hath dined. Get your apparel together, good strings to your beards, new ribbons to your pumps; meet presently at the palace; every man look o’er his part. For the short and the long is, our play is preferred. In any case, let Thisbe have clean linen; and let not him that plays the lion pare his nails, for they shall hang out for the lion’s claws. And most dear actors, eat no onions nor garlick, for we are to utter sweet breath; and I do not doubt but to hear them say it is a sweet comedy. No more words. Away! Go, away!   [_Exeunt._]

  ACT I  SCENE I. Before Leonato’s House.
Enter Leonato, Hero, Beatrice and others, with a Messenger.  LEONATO. I learn in this letter that Don Pedro of Arragon comes this night to Messina.  MESSENGER. He is very near by this: he was not three leagues off when I left him.  LEONATO. How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?  MESSENGER. But few of any sort, and none of name.  LEONATO. A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers. I find here that Don Pedro hath bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio.  MESSENGER. Much deserved on his part, and equally remembered by Don Pedro. He hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age, doing in the figure of a lamb the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better bettered expectation than you must expect of me to tell you how.  LEONATO. He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much glad of it.  MESSENGER. I have already delivered him letters, and there appears much joy in him; even so much that joy could not show itself modest enough without a badge of bitterness.  LEONATO. Did he break out into tears?  MESSENGER. In great measure.  LEONATO. A kind overflow of kindness. There are no faces truer than those that are so washed; how much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!  BEATRICE. I pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned from the wars or no?  MESSENGER. I know none of that name, lady: there was none such in the army of any sort.  LEONATO. What is he that you ask for, niece?  HERO. My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.  MESSENGER. O! he is returned, and as pleasant as ever he was.  BEATRICE. He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged Cupid at the flight; and my uncle’s fool, reading the challenge, subscribed for Cupid, and challenged him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how many hath he killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath he killed? for, indeed, I promised to eat all of his killing.  LEONATO. Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much; but he’ll be meet with you, I doubt it not.  MESSENGER. He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.  BEATRICE. You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it; he is a very valiant trencher-man; he hath an excellent stomach.  MESSENGER. And a good soldier too, lady.  BEATRICE. And a good soldier to a lady; but what is he to a lord?  MESSENGER. A lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuffed with all honourable virtues.  BEATRICE. It is so indeed; he is no less than a stuffed man; but for the stuffing,—well, we are all mortal.  LEONATO. You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her; they never meet but there’s a skirmish of wit between them.  BEATRICE. Alas! he gets nothing by that. In our last conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and now is the whole man governed with one! so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.  MESSENGER. Is’t possible?  BEATRICE. Very easily possible: he wears his faith but as the fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the next block.  MESSENGER. I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.  BEATRICE. No; and he were, I would burn my study. But I pray you, who is his companion? Is there no young squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?  MESSENGER. He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.  BEATRICE. O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease: he is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! If he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a thousand pound ere he be cured.  MESSENGER. I will hold friends with you, lady.  BEATRICE. Do, good friend.  LEONATO. You will never run mad, niece.  BEATRICE. No, not till a hot January.  MESSENGER. Don Pedro is approached.  Enter Don Pedro, Don John, Claudio, Benedick, Balthasar and Others.  DON PEDRO. Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet your trouble: the fashion of the world is to avoid cost, and you encounter it.  LEONATO. Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of your Grace, for trouble being gone, comfort should remain; but when you depart from me, sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave.  DON PEDRO. You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this is your daughter.  LEONATO. Her mother hath many times told me so.  BENEDICK. Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?  LEONATO. Signior Benedick, no; for then were you a child.  DON PEDRO. You have it full, Benedick: we may guess by this what you are, being a man. Truly the lady fathers herself. Be happy, lady, for you are like an honourable father.  BENEDICK. If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as like him as she is.  BEATRICE. I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior Benedick: nobody marks you.  BENEDICK. What! my dear Lady Disdain, are you yet living?  BEATRICE. Is it possible Disdain should die while she hath such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick? Courtesy itself must convert to disdain if you come in her presence.  BENEDICK. Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I am loved of all ladies, only you excepted; and I would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard heart; for, truly, I love none.  BEATRICE. A dear happiness to women: they would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that. I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me.  BENEDICK. God keep your Ladyship still in that mind; so some gentleman or other shall scape a predestinate scratched face.  BEATRICE. Scratching could not make it worse, and ’twere such a face as yours were.  BENEDICK. Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.  BEATRICE. A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.  BENEDICK. I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and so good a continuer. But keep your way, i’ God’s name; I have done.  BEATRICE. You always end with a jade’s trick: I know you of old.  DON PEDRO. That is the sum of all, Leonato: Signior Claudio, and Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath invited you all. I tell him we shall stay here at the least a month, and he heartly prays some occasion may detain us longer: I dare swear he is no hypocrite, but prays from his heart.  LEONATO. If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn. [To Don John] Let me bid you welcome, my lord: being reconciled to the Prince your brother, I owe you all duty.  DON JOHN. I thank you: I am not of many words, but I thank you.  LEONATO. Please it your Grace lead on?  DON PEDRO. Your hand, Leonato; we will go together.  [Exeunt all but Benedick and Claudio.]  CLAUDIO. Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?  BENEDICK. I noted her not; but I looked on her.  CLAUDIO. Is she not a modest young lady?  BENEDICK. Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for my simple true judgment; or would you have me speak after my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex?  CLAUDIO. No; I pray thee speak in sober judgment.  BENEDICK. Why, i’ faith, methinks she’s too low for a high praise, too brown for a fair praise, and too little for a great praise; only this commendation I can afford her, that were she other than she is, she were unhandsome, and being no other but as she is, I do not like her.  CLAUDIO. Thou thinkest I am in sport: I pray thee tell me truly how thou likest her.  BENEDICK. Would you buy her, that you enquire after her?  CLAUDIO. Can the world buy such a jewel?  BENEDICK. Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this with a sad brow, or do you play the flouting Jack, to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder, and Vulcan a rare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a man take you, to go in the song?  CLAUDIO. In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I looked on.  BENEDICK. I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such matter: there’s her cousin and she were not possessed with a fury, exceeds her as much in beauty as the first of May doth the last of December. But I hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you?  CLAUDIO. I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn to the contrary, if Hero would be my wife.  BENEDICK. Is’t come to this, in faith? Hath not the world one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion? Shall I never see a bachelor of threescore again? Go to, i’ faith; and thou wilt needs thrust thy neck into a yoke, wear the print of it and sigh away Sundays.  Re-enter Don Pedro.  Look! Don Pedro is returned to seek you.  DON PEDRO. What secret hath held you here, that you followed not to Leonato’s?  BENEDICK. I would your Grace would constrain me to tell.  DON PEDRO. I charge thee on thy allegiance.  BENEDICK. You hear, Count Claudio: I can be secret as a dumb man; I would have you think so; but on my allegiance mark you this, on my allegiance: he is in love. With who? now that is your Grace’s part. Mark how short his answer is: with Hero, Leonato’s short daughter.  CLAUDIO. If this were so, so were it uttered.  BENEDICK. Like the old tale, my lord: ‘it is not so, nor ’twas not so; but indeed, God forbid it should be so.’  CLAUDIO. If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it should be otherwise.  DON PEDRO. Amen, if you love her; for the lady is very well worthy.  CLAUDIO. You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.  DON PEDRO. By my troth, I speak my thought.  CLAUDIO. And in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.  BENEDICK. And by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine.  CLAUDIO. That I love her, I feel.  DON PEDRO. That she is worthy, I know.  BENEDICK. That I neither feel how she should be loved, nor know how she should be worthy, is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me: I will die in it at the stake.  DON PEDRO. Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite of beauty.  CLAUDIO. And never could maintain his part but in the force of his will.  BENEDICK. That a woman conceived me, I thank her; that she brought me up, I likewise give her most humble thanks; but that I will have a recheat winded in my forehead, or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick, all women shall pardon me. Because I will not do them the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself the right to trust none; and the fine is,—for the which I may go the finer,—I will live a bachelor.  DON PEDRO. I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.  BENEDICK. With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord; not with love: prove that ever I lose more blood with love than I will get again with drinking, pick out mine eyes with a ballad-maker’s pen and hang me up at the door of a brothel-house for the sign of blind Cupid.  DON PEDRO. Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou wilt prove a notable argument.  BENEDICK. If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot at me; and he that hits me, let him be clapped on the shoulder and called Adam.  DON PEDRO. Well, as time shall try: ‘In time the savage bull doth bear the yoke.’  BENEDICK. The savage bull may; but if ever the sensible Benedick bear it, pluck off the bull’s horns and set them in my forehead; and let me be vilely painted, and in such great letters as they write, ‘Here is good horse to hire,’ let them signify under my sign ‘Here you may see Benedick the married man.’  CLAUDIO. If this should ever happen, thou wouldst be horn-mad.  DON PEDRO. Nay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in Venice, thou wilt quake for this shortly.  BENEDICK. I look for an earthquake too then.  DON PEDRO. Well, you will temporize with the hours. In the meantime, good Signior Benedick, repair to Leonato’s: commend me to him and tell him I will not fail him at supper; for indeed he hath made great preparation.  BENEDICK. I have almost matter enough in me for such an embassage; and so I commit you—  CLAUDIO. To the tuition of God: from my house, if I had it,—  DON PEDRO. The sixth of July: your loving friend, Benedick.  BENEDICK. Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your discourse is sometime guarded with fragments, and the guards are but slightly basted on neither: ere you flout old ends any further, examine your conscience: and so I leave you.  [Exit.]  CLAUDIO. My liege, your Highness now may do me good.  DON PEDRO. My love is thine to teach: teach it but how, And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn Any hard lesson that may do thee good.  CLAUDIO. Hath Leonato any son, my lord?  DON PEDRO. No child but Hero; she’s his only heir. Dost thou affect her, Claudio?  CLAUDIO. O! my lord, When you went onward on this ended action, I looked upon her with a soldier’s eye, That lik’d, but had a rougher task in hand Than to drive liking to the name of love; But now I am return’d, and that war-thoughts Have left their places vacant, in their rooms Come thronging soft and delicate desires, All prompting me how fair young Hero is, Saying, I lik’d her ere I went to wars.  DON PEDRO. Thou wilt be like a lover presently, And tire the hearer with a book of words. If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it, And I will break with her, and with her father, And thou shalt have her. Was’t not to this end That thou began’st to twist so fine a story?  CLAUDIO. How sweetly you do minister to love, That know love’s grief by his complexion! But lest my liking might too sudden seem, I would have salv’d it with a longer treatise.  DON PEDRO. What need the bridge much broader than the flood? The fairest grant is the necessity. Look, what will serve is fit: ’tis once, thou lov’st, And I will fit thee with the remedy. I know we shall have revelling tonight: I will assume thy part in some disguise, And tell fair Hero I am Claudio; And in her bosom I’ll unclasp my heart, And take her hearing prisoner with the force And strong encounter of my amorous tale: Then after to her father will I break; And the conclusion is, she shall be thine. In practice let us put it presently.  [Exeunt.]  SCENE II. A room in Leonato’s house.  Enter Leonato and Antonio, meeting.  LEONATO. How now, brother? Where is my cousin your son? Hath he provided this music?  ANTONIO. He is very busy about it. But, brother, I can tell you strange news that you yet dreamt not of.  LEONATO. Are they good?  ANTONIO. As the event stamps them: but they have a good cover; they show well outward. The Prince and Count Claudio, walking in a thick-pleached alley in my orchard, were thus much overheard by a man of mine: the Prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it this night in a dance; and if he found her accordant, he meant to take the present time by the top and instantly break with you of it.  LEONATO.  Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?  ANTONIO. A good sharp fellow: I will send for him; and question him yourself.  LEONATO. No, no; we will hold it as a dream till it appear itself: but I will acquaint my daughter withal, that she may be the better prepared for an answer, if peradventure this be true. Go you and tell her of it.  [Several persons cross the stage.]  Cousins, you know what you have to do. O! I cry you mercy, friend; go you with me, and I will use your skill. Good cousin, have a care this busy time.  [Exeunt.]  SCENE III. Another room in Leonato’s house.  Enter Don John and Conrade.  CONRADE. What the good-year, my lord! why are you thus out of measure sad?  DON JOHN. There is no measure in the occasion that breeds; therefore the sadness is without limit.  CONRADE. You should hear reason.  DON JOHN. And when I have heard it, what blessings brings it?  CONRADE. If not a present remedy, at least a patient sufferance.  DON JOHN. I wonder that thou (being as thou say’st thou art, born under Saturn) goest about to apply a moral medicine to a mortifying mischief. I cannot hide what I am: I must be sad when I have cause, and smile at no man’s jests; eat when I have stomach, and wait for no man’s leisure; sleep when I am drowsy, and tend on no man’s business; laugh when I am merry, and claw no man in his humour.  CONRADE. Yea; but you must not make the full show of this till you may do it without controlment. You have of late stood out against your brother, and he hath ta’en you newly into his grace; where it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair weather that you make yourself: it is needful that you frame the season for your own harvest.  DON JOHN. I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace; and it better fits my blood to be disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob love from any: in this, though I cannot be said to be a flattering honest man, it must not be denied but I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog; therefore I have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my mouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I would do my liking: in the meantime, let me be that I am, and seek not to alter me.  CONRADE.  Can you make no use of your discontent?  DON JOHN.  I make all use of it, for I use it only. Who comes here?  Enter Borachio.  What news, Borachio?  BORACHIO. I came yonder from a great supper: the Prince your brother is royally entertained by Leonato; and I can give you intelligence of an intended marriage.  DON JOHN. Will it serve for any model to build mischief on? What is he for a fool that betroths himself to unquietness?  BORACHIO. Marry, it is your brother’s right hand.  DON JOHN. Who? the most exquisite Claudio?  BORACHIO. Even he.  DON JOHN. A proper squire! And who, and who? which way looks he?  BORACHIO. Marry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato.  DON JOHN. A very forward March-chick! How came you to this?  BORACHIO. Being entertained for a perfumer, as I was smoking a musty room, comes me the Prince and Claudio, hand in hand, in sad conference: I whipt me behind the arras, and there heard it agreed upon that the Prince should woo Hero for himself, and having obtained her, give her to Count Claudio.  DON JOHN. Come, come; let us thither: this may prove food to my displeasure. That young start-up hath all the glory of my overthrow: if I can cross him any way, I bless myself every way. You are both sure, and will assist me?  CONRADE.  To the death, my lord.  DON JOHN. Let us to the great supper: their cheer is the greater that I am subdued. Would the cook were of my mind! Shall we go to prove what’s to be done?  BORACHIO. We’ll wait upon your Lordship.  [Exeunt.]
  ACT II  SCENE I. A hall in Leonato’s house.
Enter Leonato, Antonio, Hero, Beatrice and others.  LEONATO. Was not Count John here at supper?  ANTONIO. I saw him not.  BEATRICE. How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see him but I am heart-burned an hour after.  HERO. He is of a very melancholy disposition.  BEATRICE. He were an excellent man that were made just in the mid-way between him and Benedick: the one is too like an image, and says nothing; and the other too like my lady’s eldest son, evermore tattling.  LEONATO. Then half Signior Benedick’s tongue in Count John’s mouth, and half Count John’s melancholy in Signior Benedick’s face—  BEATRICE. With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money enough in his purse, such a man would win any woman in the world if a’ could get her good will.  LEONATO. By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a husband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.  ANTONIO. In faith, she’s too curst.  BEATRICE. Too curst is more than curst: I shall lessen God’s sending that way; for it is said, ‘God sends a curst cow short horns;’ but to a cow too curst he sends none.  LEONATO. So, by being too curst, God will send you no horns?  BEATRICE. Just, if he send me no husband; for the which blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and evening. Lord! I could not endure a husband with a beard on his face: I had rather lie in the woollen.  LEONATO. You may light on a husband that hath no beard.  BEATRICE. What should I do with him? dress him in my apparel and make him my waiting gentlewoman? He that hath a beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no beard is less than a man; and he that is more than a youth is not for me; and he that is less than a man, I am not for him: therefore I will even take sixpence in earnest of the bear-ward, and lead his apes into hell.  LEONATO. Well then, go you into hell?  BEATRICE. No; but to the gate; and there will the Devil meet me, like an old cuckold, with horns on his head, and say, ‘Get you to heaven, Beatrice, get you to heaven; here’s no place for you maids.’ So deliver I up my apes, and away to Saint Peter for the heavens: he shows me where the bachelors sit, and there live we as merry as the day is long.  ANTONIO. [To Hero.] Well, niece, I trust you will be ruled by your father.  BEATRICE. Yes, faith; it is my cousin’s duty to make curtsy, and say, ‘Father, as it please you:’— but yet for all that, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or else make another curtsy, and say, ‘Father, as it please me.’  LEONATO. Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband.  BEATRICE. Not till God make men of some other metal than earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be over-mastered with a piece of valiant dust? to make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl? No, uncle, I’ll none: Adam’s sons are my brethren; and truly, I hold it a sin to match in my kindred.  LEONATO. Daughter, remember what I told you: if the Prince do solicit you in that kind, you know your answer.  BEATRICE. The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be not wooed in good time: if the Prince be too important, tell him there is measure in everything, and so dance out the answer. For, hear me, Hero: wooing, wedding, and repenting is as a Scotch jig, a measure, and a cinquepace: the first suit is hot and hasty, like a Scotch jig, and full as fantastical; the wedding, mannerly modest, as a measure, full of state and ancientry; and then comes Repentance, and with his bad legs, falls into the cinquepace faster and faster, till he sink into his grave.  LEONATO. Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.  BEATRICE. I have a good eye, uncle: I can see a church by daylight.  LEONATO. The revellers are entering, brother: make good room.  Enter Don Pedro, Claudio, Benedick, Balthasar, Don John, Borachio, Margaret, Ursula and Others, masked.  DON PEDRO. Lady, will you walk about with your friend?  HERO. So you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing, I am yours for the walk; and especially when I walk away.  DON PEDRO. With me in your company?  HERO. I may say so, when I please.  DON PEDRO. And when please you to say so?  HERO. When I like your favour; for God defend the lute should be like the case!  DON PEDRO. My visor is Philemon’s roof; within the house is Jove.  HERO. Why, then, your visor should be thatch’d.  DON PEDRO. Speak low, if you speak love.  [Takes her aside.]  BALTHASAR. Well, I would you did like me.  MARGARET. So would not I, for your own sake; for I have many ill qualities.  BALTHASAR. Which is one?  MARGARET. I say my prayers aloud.  BALTHASAR. I love you the better; the hearers may cry Amen.  MARGARET. God match me with a good dancer!  BALTHASAR. Amen.  MARGARET. And God keep him out of my sight when the dance is done! Answer, clerk.  BALTHASAR. No more words: the clerk is answered.  URSULA. I know you well enough: you are Signior Antonio.  ANTONIO. At a word, I am not.  URSULA. I know you by the waggling of your head.  ANTONIO. To tell you true, I counterfeit him.  URSULA. You could never do him so ill-well, unless you were the very man. Here’s his dry hand up and down: you are he, you are he.  ANTONIO. At a word, I am not.  URSULA. Come, come; do you think I do not know you by your excellent wit? Can virtue hide itself? Go to, mum, you are he: graces will appear, and there’s an end.  BEATRICE. Will you not tell me who told you so?  BENEDICK. No, you shall pardon me.  BEATRICE. Nor will you not tell me who you are?  BENEDICK. Not now.  BEATRICE. That I was disdainful, and that I had my good wit out of the ‘Hundred Merry Tales.’ Well, this was Signior Benedick that said so.  BENEDICK. What’s he?  BEATRICE. I am sure you know him well enough.  BENEDICK. Not I, believe me.  BEATRICE. Did he never make you laugh?  BENEDICK. I pray you, what is he?  BEATRICE. Why, he is the Prince’s jester: a very dull fool; only his gift is in devising impossible slanders: none but libertines delight in him; and the commendation is not in his wit, but in his villainy; for he both pleases men and angers them, and then they laugh at him and beat him. I am sure he is in the fleet: I would he had boarded me!  BENEDICK. When I know the gentleman, I’ll tell him what you say.  BEATRICE. Do, do: he’ll but break a comparison or two on me; which, peradventure not marked or not laughed at, strikes him into melancholy; and then there’s a partridge wing saved, for the fool will eat no supper that night. [Music within.] We must follow the leaders.  BENEDICK. In every good thing.  BEATRICE. Nay, if they lead to any ill, I will leave them at the next turning.  [Dance. Then exeunt all but Don John, Borachio and Claudio.]  DON JOHN. Sure my brother is amorous on Hero, and hath withdrawn her father to break with him about it. The ladies follow her and but one visor remains.  BORACHIO. And that is Claudio: I know him by his bearing.  DON JOHN. Are you not Signior Benedick?  CLAUDIO. You know me well; I am he.  DON JOHN. Signior, you are very near my brother in his love: he is enamoured on Hero; I pray you, dissuade him from her; she is no equal for his birth: you may do the part of an honest man in it.  CLAUDIO. How know you he loves her?  DON JOHN. I heard him swear his affection.  BORACHIO. So did I too; and he swore he would marry her tonight.  DON JOHN. Come, let us to the banquet.  [Exeunt Don John and Borachio.]  CLAUDIO. Thus answer I in name of Benedick, But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio. ’Tis certain so; the Prince wooss for himself. Friendship is constant in all other things Save in the office and affairs of love: Therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues; Let every eye negotiate for itself And trust no agent; for beauty is a witch Against whose charms faith melteth into blood. This is an accident of hourly proof, Which I mistrusted not. Farewell, therefore, Hero!  Re-enter Benedick.  BENEDICK. Count Claudio?  CLAUDIO. Yea, the same.  BENEDICK. Come, will you go with me?  CLAUDIO. Whither?  BENEDICK. Even to the next willow, about your own business, Count. What fashion will you wear the garland of? About your neck, like a usurer’s chain? or under your arm, like a lieutenant’s scarf? You must wear it one way, for the Prince hath got your Hero.  CLAUDIO. I wish him joy of her.  BENEDICK. Why, that’s spoken like an honest drovier: so they sell bullocks. But did you think the Prince would have served you thus?  CLAUDIO. I pray you, leave me.  BENEDICK. Ho! now you strike like the blind man: ’twas the boy that stole your meat, and you’ll beat the post.  CLAUDIO. If it will not be, I’ll leave you.  [Exit.]  BENEDICK. Alas! poor hurt fowl. Now will he creep into sedges. But, that my Lady Beatrice should know me, and not know me! The Prince’s fool! Ha! it may be I go under that title because I am merry. Yea, but so I am apt to do myself wrong; I am not so reputed: it is the base though bitter disposition of Beatrice that puts the world into her person, and so gives me out. Well, I’ll be revenged as I may.  Re-enter Don Pedro.  DON PEDRO. Now, signior, where’s the Count? Did you see him?  BENEDICK. Troth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame. I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren. I told him, and I think I told him true, that your Grace had got the good will of this young lady; and I offered him my company to a willow tree, either to make him a garland, as being forsaken, or to bind him up a rod, as being worthy to be whipped.  DON PEDRO. To be whipped! What’s his fault?  BENEDICK. The flat transgression of a school-boy, who, being overjoy’d with finding a bird’s nest, shows it his companion, and he steals it.  DON PEDRO. Wilt thou make a trust a transgression? The transgression is in the stealer.  BENEDICK. Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made, and the garland too; for the garland he might have worn himself, and the rod he might have bestowed on you, who, as I take it, have stolen his bird’s nest.  DON PEDRO. I will but teach them to sing, and restore them to the owner.  BENEDICK. If their singing answer your saying, by my faith, you say honestly.  DON PEDRO. The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you: the gentleman that danced with her told her she is much wronged by you.  BENEDICK. O! she misused me past the endurance of a block: an oak but with one green leaf on it would have answered her: my very visor began to assume life and scold with her. She told me, not thinking I had been myself, that I was the Prince’s jester, that I was duller than a great thaw; huddling jest upon jest with such impossible conveyance upon me, that I stood like a man at a mark, with a whole army shooting at me. She speaks poniards, and every word stabs: if her breath were as terrible as her terminations, there were no living near her; she would infect to the north star. I would not marry her, though she were endowed with all that Adam had left him before he transgressed: she would have made Hercules have turned spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make the fire too. Come, talk not of her; you shall find her the infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to God some scholar would conjure her, for certainly, while she is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in a sanctuary; and people sin upon purpose because they would go thither; so indeed, all disquiet, horror and perturbation follow her.  Re-enter Claudio, Beatrice, Hero and Leonato.  DON PEDRO. Look! here she comes.  BENEDICK. Will your Grace command me any service to the world’s end? I will go on the slightest errand now to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on; I will fetch you a toothpicker now from the furthest inch of Asia; bring you the length of Prester John’s foot; fetch you a hair off the Great Cham’s beard; do you any embassage to the Pygmies, rather than hold three words’ conference with this harpy. You have no employment for me?  DON PEDRO. None, but to desire your good company.  BENEDICK. O God, sir, here’s a dish I love not: I cannot endure my Lady Tongue.  [Exit.]  DON PEDRO. Come, lady, come; you have lost the heart of Signior Benedick.  BEATRICE. Indeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile; and I gave him use for it, a double heart for a single one: marry, once before he won it of me with false dice, therefore your Grace may well say I have lost it.  DON PEDRO. You have put him down, lady, you have put him down.  BEATRICE. So I would not he should do me, my lord, lest I should prove the mother of fools. I have brought Count Claudio, whom you sent me to seek.  DON PEDRO. Why, how now, Count! wherefore are you sad?  CLAUDIO. Not sad, my lord.  DON PEDRO. How then? Sick?  CLAUDIO. Neither, my lord.  BEATRICE. The Count is neither sad, nor sick, nor merry, nor well; but civil Count, civil as an orange, and something of that jealous complexion.  DON PEDRO. I’ faith, lady, I think your blazon to be true; though, I’ll be sworn, if he be so, his conceit is false. Here, Claudio, I have wooed in thy name, and fair Hero is won; I have broke with her father, and, his good will obtained; name the day of marriage, and God give thee joy!  LEONATO. Count, take of me my daughter, and with her my fortunes: his Grace hath made the match, and all grace say Amen to it!  BEATRICE. Speak, Count, ’tis your cue.  CLAUDIO. Silence is the perfectest herald of joy: I were but little happy, if I could say how much. Lady, as you are mine, I am yours: I give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange.  BEATRICE. Speak, cousin; or, if you cannot, stop his mouth with a kiss, and let not him speak neither.  DON PEDRO. In faith, lady, you have a merry heart.  BEATRICE. Yea, my lord; I thank it, poor fool, it keeps on the windy side of care. My cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heart.  CLAUDIO. And so she doth, cousin.  BEATRICE. Good Lord, for alliance! Thus goes everyone to the world but I, and I am sunburnt. I may sit in a corner and cry heigh-ho for a husband!  DON PEDRO. Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.  BEATRICE. I would rather have one of your father’s getting. Hath your Grace ne’er a brother like you? Your father got excellent husbands, if a maid could come by them.  DON PEDRO. Will you have me, lady?  BEATRICE. No, my lord, unless I might have another for working days: your Grace is too costly to wear every day. But, I beseech your Grace, pardon me; I was born to speak all mirth and no matter.  DON PEDRO. Your silence most offends me, and to be merry best becomes you; for out of question, you were born in a merry hour.  BEATRICE. No, sure, my lord, my mother cried; but then there was a star danced, and under that was I born. Cousins, God give you joy!  LEONATO. Niece, will you look to those things I told you of?  BEATRICE. I cry you mercy, uncle. By your Grace’s pardon.  [Exit.]  DON PEDRO. By my troth, a pleasant spirited lady.  LEONATO. There’s little of the melancholy element in her, my lord: she is never sad but when she sleeps; and not ever sad then, for I have heard my daughter say, she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked herself with laughing.  DON PEDRO. She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.  LEONATO. O! by no means: she mocks all her wooers out of suit.  DON PEDRO. She were an excellent wife for Benedick.  LEONATO. O Lord! my lord, if they were but a week married, they would talk themselves mad.  DON PEDRO. Count Claudio, when mean you to go to church?  CLAUDIO. Tomorrow, my lord. Time goes on crutches till love have all his rites.  LEONATO. Not till Monday, my dear son, which is hence a just seven-night; and a time too brief too, to have all things answer my mind.  DON PEDRO. Come, you shake the head at so long a breathing; but, I warrant thee, Claudio, the time shall not go dully by us. I will in the interim undertake one of Hercules’ labours, which is, to bring Signior Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of affection the one with the other. I would fain have it a match; and I doubt not but to fashion it, if you three will but minister such assistance as I shall give you direction.  LEONATO. My lord, I am for you, though it cost me ten nights’ watchings.  CLAUDIO. And I, my lord.  DON PEDRO. And you too, gentle Hero?  HERO. I will do any modest office, my lord, to help my cousin to a good husband.  DON PEDRO. And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that I know. Thus far can I praise him; he is of a noble strain, of approved valour, and confirmed honesty. I will teach you how to humour your cousin, that she shall fall in love with Benedick; and I, with your two helps, will so practise on Benedick that, in despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach, he shall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this, Cupid is no longer an archer: his glory shall be ours, for we are the only love-gods. Go in with me, and I will tell you my drift.  [Exeunt.]  SCENE II. Another room in Leonato’s house.  Enter Don John and Borachio.  DON JOHN. It is so; the Count Claudio shall marry the daughter of Leonato.  BORACHIO. Yea, my lord; but I can cross it.  DON JOHN. Any bar, any cross, any impediment will be medicinable to me: I am sick in displeasure to him, and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges evenly with mine. How canst thou cross this marriage?  BORACHIO. Not honestly, my lord; but so covertly that no dishonesty shall appear in me.  DON JOHN. Show me briefly how.  BORACHIO. I think I told your lordship, a year since, how much I am in the favour of Margaret, the waiting gentlewoman to Hero.  DON JOHN. I remember.  BORACHIO. I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night, appoint her to look out at her lady’s chamber window.  DON JOHN.  What life is in that, to be the death of this marriage?  BORACHIO. The poison of that lies in you to temper. Go you to the Prince your brother; spare not to tell him, that he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned Claudio,—whose estimation do you mightily hold up,—to a contaminated stale, such a one as Hero.  DON JOHN. What proof shall I make of that?  BORACHIO. Proof enough to misuse the Prince, to vex Claudio, to undo Hero, and kill Leonato. Look you for any other issue?  DON JOHN. Only to despite them, I will endeavour anything.  BORACHIO. Go then; find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and the Count Claudio alone: tell them that you know that Hero loves me; intend a kind of zeal both to the Prince and Claudio, as—in love of your brother’s honour, who hath made this match, and his friend’s reputation, who is thus like to be cozened with the semblance of a maid,—that you have discovered thus. They will scarcely believe this without trial: offer them instances, which shall bear no less likelihood than to see me at her chamber window, hear me call Margaret Hero, hear Margaret term me Claudio; and bring them to see this the very night before the intended wedding: for in the meantime I will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be absent; and there shall appear such seeming truth of Hero’s disloyalty, that jealousy shall be called assurance, and all the preparation overthrown.  DON JOHN. Grow this to what adverse issue it can, I will put it in practice. Be cunning in the working this, and thy fee is a thousand ducats.  BORACHIO. Be you constant in the accusation, and my cunning shall not shame me.  DON JOHN. I will presently go learn their day of marriage.  [Exeunt.]  SCENE III. Leonato’s Garden.  Enter Benedick.  BENEDICK. Boy!  Enter a Boy.  BOY. Signior?  BENEDICK. In my chamber window lies a book; bring it hither to me in the orchard.  BOY. I am here already, sir.  BENEDICK. I know that; but I would have thee hence, and here again.  [Exit Boy.]  I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviours to love, will, after he hath laughed at such shallow follies in others, become the argument of his own scorn by falling in love: and such a man is Claudio. I have known, when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife; and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe: I have known when he would have walked ten mile afoot to see a good armour; and now will he lie ten nights awake, carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont to speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest man and a soldier; and now is he turned orthography; his words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many strange dishes. May I be so converted, and see with these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not: I will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster; but I’ll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in my grace. Rich she shall be, that’s certain; wise, or I’ll none; virtuous, or I’ll never cheapen her; fair, or I’ll never look on her; mild, or come not near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall be of what colour it please God. Ha! the Prince and Monsieur Love! I will hide me in the arbour.  [Withdraws.]  Enter Don Pedro, Leonato and Claudio, followed by Balthasar and Musicians.  DON PEDRO. Come, shall we hear this music?  CLAUDIO. Yea, my good lord. How still the evening is, As hush’d on purpose to grace harmony!  DON PEDRO. See you where Benedick hath hid himself?  CLAUDIO. O! very well, my lord: the music ended, We’ll fit the kid-fox with a penny-worth.  DON PEDRO. Come, Balthasar, we’ll hear that song again.  BALTHASAR. O! good my lord, tax not so bad a voice To slander music any more than once.  DON PEDRO. It is the witness still of excellency, To put a strange face on his own perfection. I pray thee, sing, and let me woo no more.  BALTHASAR. Because you talk of wooing, I will sing; Since many a wooer doth commence his suit To her he thinks not worthy; yet he wooes; Yet will he swear he loves.  DON PEDRO. Nay, pray thee come; Or if thou wilt hold longer argument, Do it in notes.  BALTHASAR. Note this before my notes; There’s not a note of mine that’s worth the noting.  DON PEDRO. Why these are very crotchets that he speaks; Notes, notes, forsooth, and nothing!  [Music.]  BENEDICK. Now, divine air! now is his soul ravished! Is it not strange that sheep’s guts should hale souls out of men’s bodies? Well, a horn for my money, when all’s done.  BALTHASAR [sings.]     Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more,      Men were deceivers ever;     One foot in sea, and one on shore,      To one thing constant never.   Then sigh not so, but let them go,  And be you blithe and bonny,    Converting all your sounds of woe Into Hey nonny, nonny.     Sing no more ditties, sing no mo Of dumps so dull and heavy;    The fraud of men was ever so, Since summer first was leavy.  Then sigh not so, but let them go, And be you blithe and bonny,      Converting all your sounds of woe   Into Hey nonny, nonny.  DON PEDRO. By my troth, a good song.  BALTHASAR. And an ill singer, my lord.  DON PEDRO. Ha, no, no, faith; thou singest well enough for a shift.  BENEDICK. [Aside] And he had been a dog that should have howled thus, they would have hanged him; and I pray God his bad voice bode no mischief. I had as lief have heard the night-raven, come what plague could have come after it.  DON PEDRO. Yea, marry; dost thou hear, Balthasar? I pray thee, get us some excellent music, for tomorrow night we would have it at the Lady Hero’s chamber window.  BALTHASAR.  The best I can, my lord.  DON PEDRO.  Do so: farewell.  [Exeunt Balthasar and Musicians.]  Come hither, Leonato: what was it you told me of today, that your niece Beatrice was in love with Signior Benedick?  CLAUDIO. O! ay:—[Aside to Don Pedro] Stalk on, stalk on; the fowl sits. I did never think that lady would have loved any man.  LEONATO. No, nor I neither; but most wonderful that she should so dote on Signior Benedick, whom she hath in all outward behaviours seemed ever to abhor.  BENEDICK. [Aside] Is’t possible? Sits the wind in that corner?  LEONATO. By my troth, my lord, I cannot tell what to think of it but that she loves him with an enraged affection: it is past the infinite of thought.  DON PEDRO. Maybe she doth but counterfeit.  CLAUDIO. Faith, like enough.  LEONATO. O God! counterfeit! There was never counterfeit of passion came so near the life of passion as she discovers it.  DON PEDRO. Why, what effects of passion shows she?  CLAUDIO.  [Aside] Bait the hook well: this fish will bite.  LEONATO. What effects, my lord? She will sit you; [To Claudio] You heard my daughter tell you how.  CLAUDIO. She did, indeed.  DON PEDRO. How, how, I pray you? You amaze me: I would have thought her spirit had been invincible against all assaults of affection.  LEONATO. I would have sworn it had, my lord; especially against Benedick.  BENEDICK. [Aside] I should think this a gull, but that the white-bearded fellow speaks it: knavery cannot, sure, hide itself in such reverence.  CLAUDIO. [Aside] He hath ta’en the infection: hold it up.  DON PEDRO. Hath she made her affection known to Benedick?  LEONATO. No; and swears she never will: that’s her torment.  CLAUDIO. ’Tis true, indeed; so your daughter says: ‘Shall I,’ says she, ‘that have so oft encountered him with scorn, write to him that I love him?’  LEONATO. This says she now when she is beginning to write to him; for she’ll be up twenty times a night, and there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a sheet of paper: my daughter tells us all.  CLAUDIO. Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a pretty jest your daughter told us of.  LEONATO. O! when she had writ it, and was reading it over, she found Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet?  CLAUDIO. That.  LEONATO. O! she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence; railed at herself, that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew would flout her: ‘I measure him,’ says she, ‘by my own spirit; for I should flout him, if he writ to me; yea, though I love him, I should.’  CLAUDIO. Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs, beats her heart, tears her hair, prays, curses; ‘O sweet Benedick! God give me patience!’  LEONATO. She doth indeed; my daughter says so; and the ecstasy hath so much overborne her, that my daughter is sometimes afeard she will do a desperate outrage to herself. It is very true.  DON PEDRO. It were good that Benedick knew of it by some other, if she will not discover it.  CLAUDIO. To what end? he would make but a sport of it and torment the poor lady worse.  DON PEDRO. And he should, it were an alms to hang him. She’s an excellent sweet lady, and, out of all suspicion, she is virtuous.  CLAUDIO. And she is exceeding wise.  DON PEDRO. In everything but in loving Benedick.  LEONATO. O! my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body, we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory. I am sorry for her, as I have just cause, being her uncle and her guardian.  DON PEDRO. I would she had bestowed this dotage on me; I would have daffed all other respects and made her half myself. I pray you, tell Benedick of it, and hear what he will say.  LEONATO. Were it good, think you?  CLAUDIO. Hero thinks surely she will die; for she says she will die if he love her not, and she will die ere she make her love known, and she will die if he woo her, rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed crossness.  DON PEDRO. She doth well: if she should make tender of her love, ’tis very possible he’ll scorn it; for the man,—as you know all,—hath a contemptible spirit.  CLAUDIO. He is a very proper man.  DON PEDRO. He hath indeed a good outward happiness.  CLAUDIO. ’Fore God, and in my mind, very wise.  DON PEDRO. He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit.  CLAUDIO. And I take him to be valiant.  DON PEDRO. As Hector, I assure you: and in the managing of quarrels you may say he is wise; for either he avoids them with great discretion, or undertakes them with a most Christian-like fear.  LEONATO. If he do fear God, a’ must necessarily keep peace: if he break the peace, he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling.  DON PEDRO. And so will he do; for the man doth fear God, howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests he will make. Well, I am sorry for your niece. Shall we go seek Benedick and tell him of her love?  CLAUDIO. Never tell him, my lord: let her wear it out with good counsel.  LEONATO. Nay, that’s impossible: she may wear her heart out first.  DON PEDRO. Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter: let it cool the while. I love Benedick well, and I could wish he would modestly examine himself, to see how much he is unworthy so good a lady.  LEONATO. My lord, will you walk? dinner is ready.  CLAUDIO. [Aside] If he do not dote on her upon this, I will never trust my expectation.  DON PEDRO. [Aside] Let there be the same net spread for her; and that must your daughter and her gentlewoman carry. The sport will be, when they hold one an opinion of another’s dotage, and no such matter: that’s the scene that I would see, which will be merely a dumb show. Let us send her to call him in to dinner.  [Exeunt Don Pedro, Claudio and Leonato.]  BENEDICK. [Advancing from the arbour.] This can be no trick: the conference was sadly borne. They have the truth of this from Hero. They seem to pity the lady: it seems her affections have their full bent. Love me? why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censured: they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive the love come from her; they say too that she will rather die than give any sign of affection. I did never think to marry: I must not seem proud: happy are they that hear their detractions, and can put them to mending. They say the lady is fair: ’tis a truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous: ’tis so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving me: by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor no great argument of her folly, for I will be horribly in love with her. I may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me, because I have railed so long against marriage; but doth not the appetite alter? A man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age. Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humour? No; the world must be peopled. When I said I would die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I were married. Here comes Beatrice. By this day! she’s a fair lady: I do spy some marks of love in her.  Enter Beatrice.  BEATRICE. Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.  BENEDICK. Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.  BEATRICE. I took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me: if it had been painful, I would not have come.  BENEDICK. You take pleasure then in the message?  BEATRICE. Yea, just so much as you may take upon a knife’s point, and choke a daw withal. You have no stomach, signior: fare you well.  [Exit.]  BENEDICK. Ha! ‘Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner,’ there’s a double meaning in that. ‘I took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me,’ that’s as much as to say, Any pains that I take for you is as easy as thanks. If I do not take pity of her, I am a villain; if I do not love her, I am a Jew. I will go get her picture.  [Exit.]
  ACT III  SCENE I. Leonato’s Garden.
Enter Hero, Margaret and Ursula.  HERO. Good Margaret, run thee to the parlour; There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice Proposing with the Prince and Claudio: Whisper her ear, and tell her, I and Ursala Walk in the orchard, and our whole discourse Is all of her; say that thou overheard’st us, And bid her steal into the pleached bower, Where honey-suckles, ripen’d by the sun, Forbid the sun to enter; like favourites, Made proud by princes, that advance their pride Against that power that bred it. There will she hide her, To listen our propose. This is thy office; Bear thee well in it and leave us alone.  MARGARET. I’ll make her come, I warrant you, presently.  [Exit.]  HERO. Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come, As we do trace this alley up and down, Our talk must only be of Benedick: When I do name him, let it be thy part To praise him more than ever man did merit. My talk to thee must be how Benedick Is sick in love with Beatrice: of this matter Is little Cupid’s crafty arrow made, That only wounds by hearsay.  Enter Beatrice behind.  Now begin; For look where Beatrice, like a lapwing, runs Close by the ground, to hear our conference.  URSULA. The pleasant’st angling is to see the fish Cut with her golden oars the silver stream, And greedily devour the treacherous bait: So angle we for Beatrice; who even now Is couched in the woodbine coverture. Fear you not my part of the dialogue.  HERO. Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it.  [They advance to the bower.]  No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful; I know her spirits are as coy and wild As haggards of the rock.  URSULA. But are you sure That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?  HERO. So says the Prince, and my new-trothed lord.  URSULA. And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?  HERO. They did entreat me to acquaint her of it; But I persuaded them, if they lov’d Benedick, To wish him wrestle with affection, And never to let Beatrice know of it.  URSULA. Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman Deserve as full as fortunate a bed As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?  HERO. O god of love! I know he doth deserve As much as may be yielded to a man; But Nature never fram’d a woman’s heart Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice; Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes, Misprising what they look on, and her wit Values itself so highly, that to her All matter else seems weak. She cannot love, Nor take no shape nor project of affection, She is so self-endear’d.  URSULA. Sure I think so; And therefore certainly it were not good She knew his love, lest she make sport at it.  HERO. Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man, How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featur’d, But she would spell him backward: if fair-fac’d, She would swear the gentleman should be her sister; If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antick, Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed; If low, an agate very vilely cut; If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds; If silent, why, a block moved with none. So turns she every man the wrong side out, And never gives to truth and virtue that Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.  URSULA. Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.  HERO. No; not to be so odd, and from all fashions, As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable. But who dare tell her so? If I should speak, She would mock me into air: O! she would laugh me Out of myself, press me to death with wit. Therefore let Benedick, like cover’d fire, Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly: It were a better death than die with mocks, Which is as bad as die with tickling.  URSULA. Yet tell her of it: hear what she will say.  HERO. No; rather I will go to Benedick, And counsel him to fight against his passion. And, truly, I’ll devise some honest slanders To stain my cousin with. One doth not know How much an ill word may empoison liking.  URSULA. O! do not do your cousin such a wrong. She cannot be so much without true judgment,— Having so swift and excellent a wit As she is priz’d to have,—as to refuse So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.  HERO. He is the only man of Italy, Always excepted my dear Claudio.  URSULA. I pray you, be not angry with me, madam, Speaking my fancy: Signior Benedick, For shape, for bearing, argument and valour, Goes foremost in report through Italy.  HERO. Indeed, he hath an excellent good name.  URSULA. His excellence did earn it, ere he had it. When are you married, madam?  HERO. Why, every day, tomorrow. Come, go in: I’ll show thee some attires, and have thy counsel Which is the best to furnish me tomorrow.  URSULA. She’s lim’d, I warrant you, We have caught her, madam.  HERO. If it prove so, then loving goes by haps: Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.  [Exeunt Hero and Ursula.]  BEATRICE. [Advancing.] What fire is in mine ears? Can this be true? Stand I condemn’d for pride and scorn so much? Contempt, farewell! and maiden pride, adieu! No glory lives behind the back of such. And, Benedick, love on; I will requite thee, Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand: If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee To bind our loves up in a holy band; For others say thou dost deserve, and I Believe it better than reportingly.  [Exit.]  SCENE II. A Room in Leonato’s House.  Enter Don Pedro, Claudio, Benedick and Leonato.  DON PEDRO. I do but stay till your marriage be consummate, and then go I toward Arragon.  CLAUDIO. I’ll bring you thither, my lord, if you’ll vouchsafe me.  DON PEDRO. Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage, as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it. I will only be bold with Benedick for his company; for, from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot, he is all mirth; he hath twice or thrice cut Cupid’s bowstring, and the little hangman dare not shoot at him. He hath a heart as sound as a bell, and his tongue is the clapper; for what his heart thinks, his tongue speaks.  BENEDICK. Gallants, I am not as I have been.  LEONATO. So say I: methinks you are sadder.  CLAUDIO. I hope he be in love.  DON PEDRO. Hang him, truant! there’s no true drop of blood in him to be truly touched with love. If he be sad, he wants money.  BENEDICK. I have the tooth-ache.  DON PEDRO. Draw it.  BENEDICK. Hang it.  CLAUDIO. You must hang it first, and draw it afterwards.  DON PEDRO. What! sigh for the tooth-ache?  LEONATO. Where is but a humour or a worm?  BENEDICK. Well, everyone can master a grief but he that has it.  CLAUDIO. Yet say I, he is in love.  DON PEDRO. There is no appearance of fancy in him, unless it be a fancy that he hath to strange disguises; as to be a Dutchman today, a Frenchman tomorrow; or in the shape of two countries at once, as a German from the waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard from the hip upward, no doublet. Unless he have a fancy to this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no fool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is.  CLAUDIO. If he be not in love with some woman, there is no believing old signs: a’ brushes his hat a mornings; what should that bode?  DON PEDRO. Hath any man seen him at the barber’s?  CLAUDIO. No, but the barber’s man hath been seen with him; and the old ornament of his cheek hath already stuffed tennis balls.  LEONATO. Indeed he looks younger than he did, by the loss of a beard.  DON PEDRO. Nay, a’ rubs himself with civet: can you smell him out by that?  CLAUDIO. That’s as much as to say the sweet youth’s in love.  DON PEDRO. The greatest note of it is his melancholy.  CLAUDIO. And when was he wont to wash his face?  DON PEDRO. Yea, or to paint himself? for the which, I hear what they say of him.  CLAUDIO. Nay, but his jesting spirit; which is now crept into a lute-string, and now governed by stops.  DON PEDRO. Indeed, that tells a heavy tale for him. Conclude, conclude he is in love.  CLAUDIO. Nay, but I know who loves him.  DON PEDRO. That would I know too: I warrant, one that knows him not.  CLAUDIO. Yes, and his ill conditions; and in despite of all, dies for him.  DON PEDRO. She shall be buried with her face upwards.  BENEDICK. Yet is this no charm for the tooth-ache. Old signior, walk aside with me: I have studied eight or nine wise words to speak to you, which these hobby-horses must not hear.  [Exeunt Benedick and Leonato.]  DON PEDRO. For my life, to break with him about Beatrice.  CLAUDIO. ’Tis even so. Hero and Margaret have by this played their parts with Beatrice, and then the two bears will not bite one another when they meet.  Enter Don John.  DON JOHN. My lord and brother, God save you!  DON PEDRO. Good den, brother.  DON JOHN. If your leisure served, I would speak with you.  DON PEDRO. In private?  DON JOHN. If it please you; yet Count Claudio may hear, for what I would speak of concerns him.  DON PEDRO. What’s the matter?  DON JOHN. [To Claudio.] Means your lordship to be married tomorrow?  DON PEDRO. You know he does.  DON JOHN. I know not that, when he knows what I know.  CLAUDIO. If there be any impediment, I pray you discover it.  DON JOHN. You may think I love you not: let that appear hereafter, and aim better at me by that I now will manifest. For my brother, I think he holds you well, and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect your ensuing marriage; surely suit ill-spent and labour ill bestowed!  DON PEDRO. Why, what’s the matter?  DON JOHN. I came hither to tell you; and circumstances shortened,—for she has been too long a talking of,—the lady is disloyal.  CLAUDIO. Who, Hero?  DON JOHN. Even she: Leonato’s Hero, your Hero, every man’s Hero.  CLAUDIO. Disloyal?  DON JOHN. The word’s too good to paint out her wickedness; I could say, she were worse: think you of a worse title, and I will fit her to it. Wonder not till further warrant: go but with me tonight, you shall see her chamber window entered, even the night before her wedding-day: if you love her then, tomorrow wed her; but it would better fit your honour to change your mind.  CLAUDIO. May this be so?  DON PEDRO. I will not think it.  DON JOHN. If you dare not trust that you see, confess not that you know. If you will follow me, I will show you enough; and when you have seen more and heard more, proceed accordingly.  CLAUDIO. If I see anything tonight why I should not marry her tomorrow, in the congregation, where I should wed, there will I shame her.  DON PEDRO. And, as I wooed for thee to obtain her, I will join with thee to disgrace her.  DON JOHN. I will disparage her no farther till you are my witnesses: bear it coldly but till midnight, and let the issue show itself.  DON PEDRO. O day untowardly turned!  CLAUDIO. O mischief strangely thwarting!  DON JOHN. O plague right well prevented! So will you say when you have seen the sequel.  [Exeunt.]  Scene III. A Street.  Enter Dogberry and Verges, with the Watch.  DOGBERRY. Are you good men and true?  VERGES. Yea, or else it were pity but they should suffer salvation, body and soul.  DOGBERRY. Nay, that were a punishment too good for them, if they should have any allegiance in them, being chosen for the Prince’s watch.  VERGES. Well, give them their charge, neighbour Dogberry.  DOGBERRY. First, who think you the most desartless man to be constable?  FIRST WATCH. Hugh Oatcake, sir, or George Seacoal; for they can write and read.  DOGBERRY. Come hither, neighbour Seacoal. God hath blessed you with a good name: to be a well-favoured man is the gift of Fortune; but to write and read comes by Nature.  SECOND WATCH. Both which, Master Constable,—  DOGBERRY. You have: I knew it would be your answer. Well, for your favour, sir, why, give God thanks, and make no boast of it; and for your writing and reading, let that appear when there is no need of such vanity. You are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch; therefore bear you the lanthorn. This is your charge: you shall comprehend all vagrom men; you are to bid any man stand, in the Prince’s name.  SECOND WATCH. How, if a’ will not stand?  DOGBERRY. Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go; and presently call the rest of the watch together, and thank God you are rid of a knave.  VERGES. If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is none of the Prince’s subjects.  DOGBERRY. True, and they are to meddle with none but the Prince’s subjects. You shall also make no noise in the streets: for, for the watch to babble and to talk is most tolerable and not to be endured.  SECOND WATCH. We will rather sleep than talk: we know what belongs to a watch.  DOGBERRY. Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman, for I cannot see how sleeping should offend; only have a care that your bills be not stolen. Well, you are to call at all the alehouses, and bid those that are drunk get them to bed.  SECOND WATCH. How if they will not?  DOGBERRY. Why then, let them alone till they are sober: if they make you not then the better answer, you may say they are not the men you took them for.  SECOND WATCH. Well, sir.  DOGBERRY. If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue of your office, to be no true man; and, for such kind of men, the less you meddle or make with them, why, the more is for your honesty.  SECOND WATCH. If we know him to be a thief, shall we not lay hands on him?  DOGBERRY. Truly, by your office, you may; but I think they that touch pitch will be defiled. The most peaceable way for you, if you do take a thief, is to let him show himself what he is and steal out of your company.  VERGES. You have been always called a merciful man, partner.  DOGBERRY. Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will, much more a man who hath any honesty in him.  VERGES. If you hear a child cry in the night, you must call to the nurse and bid her still it.  SECOND WATCH. How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us?  DOGBERRY. Why then, depart in peace, and let the child wake her with crying; for the ewe that will not hear her lamb when it baes, will never answer a calf when he bleats.  VERGES. ’Tis very true.  DOGBERRY. This is the end of the charge. You constable, are to present the Prince’s own person: if you meet the Prince in the night, you may stay him.  VERGES. Nay, by’r lady, that I think, a’ cannot.  DOGBERRY. Five shillings to one on’t, with any man that knows the statutes, he may stay him: marry, not without the Prince be willing; for, indeed, the watch ought to offend no man, and it is an offence to stay a man against his will.  VERGES. By’r lady, I think it be so.  DOGBERRY. Ha, ah, ha! Well, masters, good night: an there be any matter of weight chances, call up me: keep your fellows’ counsels and your own, and good night. Come, neighbour.  SECOND WATCH. Well, masters, we hear our charge: let us go sit here upon the church bench till two, and then all to bed.  DOGBERRY. One word more, honest neighbours. I pray you, watch about Signior Leonato’s door; for the wedding being there tomorrow, there is a great coil tonight. Adieu; be vigitant, I beseech you.  [Exeunt Dogberry and Verges.]  Enter Borachio and Conrade.  BORACHIO. What, Conrade!  WATCH. [Aside] Peace! stir not.  BORACHIO. Conrade, I say!  CONRADE. Here, man. I am at thy elbow.  BORACHIO. Mass, and my elbow itched; I thought there would a scab follow.  CONRADE. I will owe thee an answer for that; and now forward with thy tale.  BORACHIO. Stand thee close then under this penthouse, for it drizzles rain, and I will, like a true drunkard, utter all to thee.  WATCH. [Aside] Some treason, masters; yet stand close.  BORACHIO. Therefore know, I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats.  CONRADE. Is it possible that any villainy should be so dear?  BORACHIO. Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any villainy should be so rich; for when rich villains have need of poor ones, poor ones may make what price they will.  CONRADE. I wonder at it.  BORACHIO. That shows thou art unconfirmed. Thou knowest that the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak, is nothing to a man.  CONRADE. Yes, it is apparel.  BORACHIO. I mean, the fashion.  CONRADE. Yes, the fashion is the fashion.  BORACHIO. Tush! I may as well say the fool’s the fool. But seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion is?  WATCH. [Aside] I know that Deformed; a’ has been a vile thief this seven years; a’ goes up and down like a gentleman: I remember his name.  BORACHIO. Didst thou not hear somebody?  CONRADE. No: ’twas the vane on the house.  BORACHIO. Seest thou not, I say, what a deformed thief this fashion is? how giddily he turns about all the hot bloods between fourteen and five-and-thirty? sometime fashioning them like Pharaoh’s soldiers in the reechy painting; sometime like god Bel’s priests in the old church window; sometime like the shaven Hercules in the smirched worm-eaten tapestry, where his codpiece seems as massy as his club?  CONRADE. All this I see, and I see that the fashion wears out more apparel than the man. But art not thou thyself giddy with the fashion too, that thou hast shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion?  BORACHIO. Not so neither; but know, that I have tonight wooed Margaret, the Lady Hero’s gentlewoman, by the name of Hero: she leans me out at her mistress’ chamber window, bids me a thousand times good night,—I tell this tale vilely:—I should first tell thee how the Prince, Claudio, and my master, planted and placed and possessed by my master Don John, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter.  CONRADE. And thought they Margaret was Hero?  BORACHIO. Two of them did, the Prince and Claudio; but the devil my master, knew she was Margaret; and partly by his oaths, which first possessed them, partly by the dark night, which did deceive them, but chiefly by my villainy, which did confirm any slander that Don John had made, away went Claudio enraged; swore he would meet her, as he was appointed, next morning at the temple, and there, before the whole congregation, shame her with what he saw o’er night, and send her home again without a husband.  FIRST WATCH. We charge you in the Prince’s name, stand!  SECOND WATCH. Call up the right Master Constable. We have here recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that ever was known in the commonwealth.  FIRST WATCH. And one Deformed is one of them: I know him, a’ wears a lock.  CONRADE. Masters, masters!  SECOND WATCH. You’ll be made bring Deformed forth, I warrant you.  CONRADE. Masters,—  FIRST WATCH. Never speak: we charge you let us obey you to go with us.  BORACHIO. We are like to prove a goodly commodity, being taken up of these men’s bills.  CONRADE. A commodity in question, I warrant you. Come, we’ll obey you.  [Exeunt.]  Scene IV. A Room in Leonato’s House.  Enter Hero, Margaret and Ursula.  HERO. Good Ursula, wake my cousin Beatrice, and desire her to rise.  URSULA. I will, lady.  HERO. And bid her come hither.  URSULA. Well.  [Exit.]  MARGARET. Troth, I think your other rebato were better.  HERO. No, pray thee, good Meg, I’ll wear this.  MARGARET. By my troth’s not so good; and I warrant your cousin will say so.  HERO. My cousin’s a fool, and thou art another: I’ll wear none but this.  MARGARET. I like the new tire within excellently, if the hair were a thought browner; and your gown’s a most rare fashion, i’ faith. I saw the Duchess of Milan’s gown that they praise so.  HERO. O! that exceeds, they say.  MARGARET. By my troth ’s but a night-gown in respect of yours: cloth o’ gold, and cuts, and laced with silver, set with pearls, down sleeves, side sleeves, and skirts round, underborne with a bluish tinsel; but for a fine, quaint, graceful, and excellent fashion, yours is worth ten on’t.  HERO. God give me joy to wear it! for my heart is exceeding heavy.  MARGARET. ’Twill be heavier soon by the weight of a man.  HERO. Fie upon thee! art not ashamed?  MARGARET. Of what, lady? of speaking honourably? Is not marriage honourable in a beggar? Is not your lord honourable without marriage? I think you would have me say, saving your reverence, ‘a husband:’ an bad thinking do not wrest true speaking, I’ll offend nobody. Is there any harm in ‘the heavier for a husband’? None, I think, and it be the right husband and the right wife; otherwise ’tis light, and not heavy: ask my Lady Beatrice else; here she comes.  Enter Beatrice.  HERO. Good morrow, coz.  BEATRICE. Good morrow, sweet Hero.  HERO. Why, how now? do you speak in the sick tune?  BEATRICE. I am out of all other tune, methinks.  MARGARET. Clap’s into ‘Light o’ love’; that goes without a burden: do you sing it, and I’ll dance it.  BEATRICE. Ye, light o’ love with your heels! then, if your husband have stables enough, you’ll see he shall lack no barnes.  MARGARET. O illegitimate construction! I scorn that with my heels.  BEATRICE. ’Tis almost five o’clock, cousin; ’tis time you were ready. By my troth, I am exceeding ill. Heigh-ho!  MARGARET. For a hawk, a horse, or a husband?  BEATRICE. For the letter that begins them all, H.  MARGARET. Well, and you be not turned Turk, there’s no more sailing by the star.  BEATRICE. What means the fool, trow?  MARGARET. Nothing I; but God send everyone their heart’s desire!  HERO. These gloves the Count sent me; they are an excellent perfume.  BEATRICE. I am stuffed, cousin, I cannot smell.  MARGARET. A maid, and stuffed! there’s goodly catching of cold.  BEATRICE. O, God help me! God help me! how long have you professed apprehension?  MARGARET. Ever since you left it. Doth not my wit become me rarely!  BEATRICE. It is not seen enough, you should wear it in your cap. By my troth, I am sick.  MARGARET. Get you some of this distilled Carduus benedictus, and lay it to your heart: it is the only thing for a qualm.  HERO. There thou prick’st her with a thistle.  BEATRICE. Benedictus! why benedictus? you have some moral in this benedictus.  MARGARET. Moral! no, by my troth, I have no moral meaning; I meant, plain holy thistle. You may think, perchance, that I think you are in love: nay, by’r Lady, I am not such a fool to think what I list; nor I list not to think what I can; nor, indeed, I cannot think, if I would think my heart out of thinking, that you are in love, or that you will be in love, or that you can be in love. Yet Benedick was such another, and now is he become a man: he swore he would never marry; and yet now, in despite of his heart, he eats his meat without grudging: and how you may be converted, I know not; but methinks you look with your eyes as other women do.  BEATRICE. What pace is this that thy tongue keeps?  MARGARET. Not a false gallop.  Re-enter Ursula.  URSULA. Madam, withdraw: the Prince, the Count, Signior Benedick, Don John, and all the gallants of the town are come to fetch you to church.  HERO. Help to dress me, good coz, good Meg, good Ursula.  [Exeunt.]  Scene V. Another Room in Leonato’s House.  Enter Leonato and Dogberry and Verges.  LEONATO. What would you with me, honest neighbour?  DOGBERRY. Marry, sir, I would have some confidence with you, that decerns you nearly.  LEONATO. Brief, I pray you; for you see it is a busy time with me.  DOGBERRY. Marry, this it is, sir.  VERGES. Yes, in truth it is, sir.  LEONATO. What is it, my good friends?  DOGBERRY. Goodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the matter: an old man, sir, and his wits are not so blunt as, God help, I would desire they were; but, in faith, honest as the skin between his brows.  VERGES. Yes, I thank God, I am as honest as any man living, that is an old man and no honester than I.  DOGBERRY. Comparisons are odorous: palabras, neighbour Verges.  LEONATO. Neighbours, you are tedious.  DOGBERRY. It pleases your worship to say so, but we are the poor Duke’s officers; but truly, for mine own part, if I were as tedious as a king, I could find in my heart to bestow it all of your worship.  LEONATO. All thy tediousness on me! ah?  DOGBERRY. Yea, and ’twere a thousand pound more than ’tis; for I hear as good exclamation on your worship, as of any man in the city, and though I be but a poor man, I am glad to hear it.  VERGES. And so am I.  LEONATO. I would fain know what you have to say.  VERGES. Marry, sir, our watch tonight, excepting your worship’s presence, ha’ ta’en a couple of as arrant knaves as any in Messina.  DOGBERRY. A good old man, sir; he will be talking; as they say, ‘when the age is in, the wit is out.’ God help us! it is a world to see! Well said, i’ faith, neighbour Verges: well, God’s a good man; and two men ride of a horse, one must ride behind. An honest soul, i’ faith, sir; by my troth he is, as ever broke bread; but God is to be worshipped: all men are not alike; alas! good neighbour.  LEONATO. Indeed, neighbour, he comes too short of you.  DOGBERRY. Gifts that God gives.  LEONATO. I must leave you.  DOGBERRY. One word, sir: our watch, sir, have indeed comprehended two aspicious persons, and we would have them this morning examined before your worship.  LEONATO. Take their examination yourself, and bring it me: I am now in great haste, as may appear unto you.  DOGBERRY. It shall be suffigance.  LEONATO. Drink some wine ere you go: fare you well.  Enter a Messenger.  MESSENGER. My lord, they stay for you to give your daughter to her husband.  LEONATO. I’ll wait upon them: I am ready.  [Exeunt Leonato and Messenger.]  DOGBERRY. Go, good partner, go get you to Francis Seacoal; bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the gaol: we are now to examination these men.  VERGES. And we must do it wisely.  DOGBERRY. We will spare for no wit, I warrant you; here’s that shall drive some of them to a non-come: only get the learned writer to set down our excommunication, and meet me at the gaol.  [Exeunt.]
  ACT IV  SCENE I. The Inside of a Church.
Enter Don Pedro, Don John, Leonato, Friar Francis, Claudio, Benedick, Hero, Beatrice &c.  LEONATO. Come, Friar Francis, be brief: only to the plain form of marriage, and you shall recount their particular duties afterwards.  FRIAR. You come hither, my lord, to marry this lady?  CLAUDIO. No.  LEONATO. To be married to her, friar; you come to marry her.  FRIAR. Lady, you come hither to be married to this Count?  HERO. I do.  FRIAR. If either of you know any inward impediment, why you should not be conjoined, I charge you, on your souls, to utter it.  CLAUDIO. Know you any, Hero?  HERO. None, my lord.  FRIAR. Know you any, Count?  LEONATO. I dare make his answer; none.  CLAUDIO. O! what men dare do! what men may do! what men daily do, not knowing what they do!  BENEDICK. How now! Interjections? Why then, some be of laughing, as ah! ha! he!  CLAUDIO. Stand thee by, Friar. Father, by your leave: Will you with free and unconstrained soul Give me this maid, your daughter?  LEONATO. As freely, son, as God did give her me.  CLAUDIO. And what have I to give you back whose worth May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?  DON PEDRO. Nothing, unless you render her again.  CLAUDIO. Sweet Prince, you learn me noble thankfulness. There, Leonato, take her back again: Give not this rotten orange to your friend; She’s but the sign and semblance of her honour. Behold! how like a maid she blushes here. O! what authority and show of truth Can cunning sin cover itself withal. Comes not that blood as modest evidence To witness simple virtue? Would you not swear, All you that see her, that she were a maid, By these exterior shows? But she is none: She knows the heat of a luxurious bed; Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.  LEONATO. What do you mean, my lord?  CLAUDIO. Not to be married, Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton.  LEONATO. Dear my lord, if you, in your own proof, Have vanquish’d the resistance of her youth, And made defeat of her virginity,—  CLAUDIO. I know what you would say: if I have known her, You will say she did embrace me as a husband, And so extenuate the forehand sin: No, Leonato, I never tempted her with word too large; But as a brother to his sister show’d Bashful sincerity and comely love.  HERO. And seem’d I ever otherwise to you?  CLAUDIO. Out on thee! Seeming! I will write against it: You seem to me as Dian in her orb, As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown; But you are more intemperate in your blood Than Venus, or those pamper’d animals That rage in savage sensuality.  HERO. Is my lord well, that he doth speak so wide?  LEONATO. Sweet Prince, why speak not you?  DON PEDRO. What should I speak? I stand dishonour’d, that have gone about To link my dear friend to a common stale.  LEONATO. Are these things spoken, or do I but dream?  DON JOHN. Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true.  BENEDICK. This looks not like a nuptial.  HERO. True! O God!  CLAUDIO. Leonato, stand I here? Is this the Prince? Is this the Prince’s brother? Is this face Hero’s? Are our eyes our own?  LEONATO. All this is so; but what of this, my lord?  CLAUDIO. Let me but move one question to your daughter, And by that fatherly and kindly power That you have in her, bid her answer truly.  LEONATO. I charge thee do so, as thou art my child.  HERO. O, God defend me! how am I beset! What kind of catechizing call you this?  CLAUDIO. To make you answer truly to your name.  HERO. Is it not Hero? Who can blot that name With any just reproach?  CLAUDIO. Marry, that can Hero: Hero itself can blot out Hero’s virtue. What man was he talk’d with you yesternight Out at your window, betwixt twelve and one? Now, if you are a maid, answer to this.  HERO. I talk’d with no man at that hour, my lord.  DON PEDRO. Why, then are you no maiden. Leonato, I am sorry you must hear: upon my honour, Myself, my brother, and this grieved Count, Did see her, hear her, at that hour last night, Talk with a ruffian at her chamber window; Who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain, Confess’d the vile encounters they have had A thousand times in secret.  DON JOHN. Fie, fie! they are not to be nam’d, my lord, Not to be spoke of; There is not chastity enough in language Without offence to utter them. Thus, pretty lady, I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.  CLAUDIO. O Hero! what a Hero hadst thou been, If half thy outward graces had been plac’d About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart! But fare thee well, most foul, most fair! farewell, Thou pure impiety, and impious purity! For thee I’ll lock up all the gates of love, And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang, To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm, And never shall it more be gracious.  LEONATO. Hath no man’s dagger here a point for me?  [Hero swoons.]  BEATRICE. Why, how now, cousin! wherefore sink you down?  DON JOHN. Come, let us go. These things, come thus to light, Smother her spirits up.  [Exeunt Don Pedro, Don John and Claudio.]  BENEDICK. How doth the lady?  BEATRICE. Dead, I think! Help, uncle! Hero! why, Hero! Uncle! Signior Benedick! Friar!  LEONATO. O Fate! take not away thy heavy hand: Death is the fairest cover for her shame That may be wish’d for.  BEATRICE. How now, cousin Hero?  FRIAR. Have comfort, lady.  LEONATO. Dost thou look up?  FRIAR. Yea; wherefore should she not?  LEONATO. Wherefore! Why, doth not every earthly thing Cry shame upon her? Could she here deny The story that is printed in her blood? Do not live, Hero; do not ope thine eyes; For, did I think thou wouldst not quickly die, Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames, Myself would, on the rearward of reproaches, Strike at thy life. Griev’d I, I had but one? Chid I for that at frugal Nature’s frame? O! one too much by thee. Why had I one? Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes? Why had I not with charitable hand Took up a beggar’s issue at my gates, Who smirched thus, and mir’d with infamy, I might have said, ‘No part of it is mine; This shame derives itself from unknown loins?’ But mine, and mine I lov’d, and mine I prais’d, And mine that I was proud on, mine so much That I myself was to myself not mine, Valuing of her; why, she—O! she is fallen Into a pit of ink, that the wide sea Hath drops too few to wash her clean again, And salt too little which may season give To her foul tainted flesh.  BENEDICK. Sir, sir, be patient. For my part, I am so attir’d in wonder, I know not what to say.  BEATRICE. O! on my soul, my cousin is belied!  BENEDICK. Lady, were you her bedfellow last night?  BEATRICE. No, truly, not; although, until last night, I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow.  LEONATO. Confirm’d, confirm’d! O! that is stronger made, Which was before barr’d up with ribs of iron. Would the two princes lie? and Claudio lie, Who lov’d her so, that, speaking of her foulness, Wash’d it with tears? Hence from her! let her die.  FRIAR. Hear me a little; For I have only been silent so long, And given way unto this course of fortune, By noting of the lady: I have mark’d A thousand blushing apparitions To start into her face; a thousand innocent shames In angel whiteness bear away those blushes; And in her eye there hath appear’d a fire, To burn the errors that these princes hold Against her maiden truth. Call me a fool; Trust not my reading nor my observations, Which with experimental seal doth warrant The tenure of my book; trust not my age, My reverence, calling, nor divinity, If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here Under some biting error.  LEONATO. Friar, it cannot be. Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left Is that she will not add to her damnation A sin of perjury: she not denies it. Why seek’st thou then to cover with excuse That which appears in proper nakedness?  FRIAR. Lady, what man is he you are accus’d of?  HERO. They know that do accuse me, I know none; If I know more of any man alive Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant, Let all my sins lack mercy! O, my father! Prove you that any man with me convers’d At hours unmeet, or that I yesternight Maintain’d the change of words with any creature, Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death.  FRIAR. There is some strange misprision in the princes.  BENEDICK. Two of them have the very bent of honour; And if their wisdoms be misled in this, The practice of it lives in John the bastard, Whose spirits toil in frame of villainies.  LEONATO. I know not. If they speak but truth of her, These hands shall tear her; if they wrong her honour, The proudest of them shall well hear of it. Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine, Nor age so eat up my invention, Nor fortune made such havoc of my means, Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends, But they shall find, awak’d in such a kind, Both strength of limb and policy of mind, Ability in means and choice of friends, To quit me of them throughly.  FRIAR. Pause awhile, And let my counsel sway you in this case. Your daughter here the princes left for dead; Let her awhile be secretly kept in, And publish it that she is dead indeed: Maintain a mourning ostentation; And on your family’s old monument Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites That appertain unto a burial.  LEONATO. What shall become of this? What will this do?  FRIAR. Marry, this well carried shall on her behalf Change slander to remorse; that is some good. But not for that dream I on this strange course, But on this travail look for greater birth. She dying, as it must be so maintain’d, Upon the instant that she was accus’d, Shall be lamented, pitied and excus’d Of every hearer; for it so falls out That what we have we prize not to the worth Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack’d and lost, Why, then we rack the value, then we find The virtue that possession would not show us Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio: When he shall hear she died upon his words, The idea of her life shall sweetly creep Into his study of imagination, And every lovely organ of her life Shall come apparell’d in more precious habit, More moving, delicate, and full of life Into the eye and prospect of his soul, Than when she liv’d indeed: then shall he mourn,— If ever love had interest in his liver,— And wish he had not so accused her, No, though he thought his accusation true. Let this be so, and doubt not but success Will fashion the event in better shape Than I can lay it down in likelihood. But if all aim but this be levell’d false, The supposition of the lady’s death Will quench the wonder of her infamy: And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,— As best befits her wounded reputation,— In some reclusive and religious life, Out of all eyes, tongues, minds, and injuries.  BENEDICK. Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you: And though you know my inwardness and love Is very much unto the Prince and Claudio, Yet, by mine honour, I will deal in this As secretly and justly as your soul Should with your body.  LEONATO. Being that I flow in grief, The smallest twine may lead me.  FRIAR. ’Tis well consented: presently away; For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure. Come, lady, die to live: this wedding day Perhaps is but prolong’d: have patience and endure.  [Exeunt Friar, Hero and Leonato.]  BENEDICK. Lady Beatrice, have you wept all this while?  BEATRICE. Yea, and I will weep a while longer.  BENEDICK. I will not desire that.  BEATRICE. You have no reason; I do it freely.  BENEDICK. Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged.  BEATRICE. Ah! how much might the man deserve of me that would right her.  BENEDICK. Is there any way to show such friendship?  BEATRICE. A very even way, but no such friend.  BENEDICK. May a man do it?  BEATRICE. It is a man’s office, but not yours.  BENEDICK. I do love nothing in the world so well as you: is not that strange?  BEATRICE. As strange as the thing I know not. It were as possible for me to say I loved nothing so well as you; but believe me not, and yet I lie not; I confess nothing, nor I deny nothing. I am sorry for my cousin.  BENEDICK. By my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me.  BEATRICE. Do not swear by it, and eat it.  BENEDICK. I will swear by it that you love me; and I will make him eat it that says I love not you.  BEATRICE. Will you not eat your word?  BENEDICK. With no sauce that can be devised to it. I protest I love thee.  BEATRICE. Why then, God forgive me!  BENEDICK. What offence, sweet Beatrice?  BEATRICE. You have stayed me in a happy hour: I was about to protest I loved you.  BENEDICK. And do it with all thy heart.  BEATRICE. I love you with so much of my heart that none is left to protest.  BENEDICK. Come, bid me do anything for thee.  BEATRICE. Kill Claudio.  BENEDICK. Ha! not for the wide world.  BEATRICE. You kill me to deny it. Farewell.  BENEDICK. Tarry, sweet Beatrice.  BEATRICE. I am gone, though I am here: there is no love in you: nay, I pray you, let me go.  BENEDICK. Beatrice,—  BEATRICE. In faith, I will go.  BENEDICK. We’ll be friends first.  BEATRICE. You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy.  BENEDICK. Is Claudio thine enemy?  BEATRICE. Is he not approved in the height a villain, that hath slandered, scorned, dishonoured my kinswoman? O! that I were a man. What! bear her in hand until they come to take hands, and then, with public accusation, uncovered slander, unmitigated rancour,—O God, that I were a man! I would eat his heart in the market-place.  BENEDICK. Hear me, Beatrice,—  BEATRICE. Talk with a man out at a window! a proper saying!  BENEDICK. Nay, but Beatrice,—  BEATRICE. Sweet Hero! she is wronged, she is slandered, she is undone.  BENEDICK. Beat—  BEATRICE. Princes and Counties! Surely, a princely testimony, a goodly Count Comfect; a sweet gallant, surely! O! that I were a man for his sake, or that I had any friend would be a man for my sake! But manhood is melted into curtsies, valour into compliment, and men are only turned into tongue, and trim ones too: he is now as valiant as Hercules, that only tells a lie and swears it. I cannot be a man with wishing, therefore I will die a woman with grieving.  BENEDICK. Tarry, good Beatrice. By this hand, I love thee.  BEATRICE. Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it.  BENEDICK. Think you in your soul the Count Claudio hath wronged Hero?  BEATRICE. Yea, as sure is I have a thought or a soul.  BENEDICK. Enough! I am engaged, I will challenge him. I will kiss your hand, and so leave you. By this hand, Claudio shall render me a dear account. As you hear of me, so think of me. Go, comfort your cousin: I must say she is dead; and so, farewell.  [Exeunt.]  Scene II. A Prison.  Enter Dogberry, Verges, and Sexton, in gowns; and the Watch, with Conrade and Borachio.  DOGBERRY. Is our whole dissembly appeared?  VERGES. O! a stool and a cushion for the sexton.  SEXTON. Which be the malefactors?  DOGBERRY. Marry, that am I and my partner.  VERGES. Nay, that’s certain: we have the exhibition to examine.  SEXTON. But which are the offenders that are to be examined? let them come before Master Constable.  DOGBERRY. Yea, marry, let them come before me. What is your name, friend?  BORACHIO. Borachio.  DOGBERRY. Pray write down Borachio. Yours, sirrah?  CONRADE. I am a gentleman, sir, and my name is Conrade.  DOGBERRY. Write down Master gentleman Conrade. Masters, do you serve God?  BOTH. Yea, sir, we hope.  DOGBERRY. Write down that they hope they serve God: and write God first; for God defend but God should go before such villains! Masters, it is proved already that you are little better than false knaves, and it will go near to be thought so shortly. How answer you for yourselves?  CONRADE. Marry, sir, we say we are none.  DOGBERRY. A marvellous witty fellow, I assure you; but I will go about with him. Come you hither, sirrah; a word in your ear: sir, I say to you, it is thought you are false knaves.  BORACHIO. Sir, I say to you we are none.  DOGBERRY. Well, stand aside. Fore God, they are both in a tale. Have you writ down, that they are none?  SEXTON. Master Constable, you go not the way to examine: you must call forth the watch that are their accusers.  DOGBERRY. Yea, marry, that’s the eftest way. Let the watch come forth. Masters, I charge you, in the Prince’s name, accuse these men.  FIRST WATCH. This man said, sir, that Don John, the Prince’s brother, was a villain.  DOGBERRY. Write down Prince John a villain. Why, this is flat perjury, to call a Prince’s brother villain.  BORACHIO. Master Constable,—  DOGBERRY. Pray thee, fellow, peace: I do not like thy look, I promise thee.  SEXTON. What heard you him say else?  SECOND WATCH. Marry, that he had received a thousand ducats of Don John for accusing the Lady Hero wrongfully.  DOGBERRY. Flat burglary as ever was committed.  VERGES. Yea, by the mass, that it is.  SEXTON. What else, fellow?  FIRST WATCH. And that Count Claudio did mean, upon his words, to disgrace Hero before the whole assembly, and not marry her.  DOGBERRY. O villain! thou wilt be condemned into everlasting redemption for this.  SEXTON. What else?  SECOND WATCH. This is all.  SEXTON. And this is more, masters, than you can deny. Prince John is this morning secretly stolen away: Hero was in this manner accused, in this manner refused, and, upon the grief of this, suddenly died. Master Constable, let these men be bound, and brought to Leonato’s: I will go before and show him their examination.  [Exit.]  DOGBERRY. Come, let them be opinioned.  VERGES. Let them be in the hands—  CONRADE. Off, coxcomb!  DOGBERRY. God’s my life! where’s the sexton? let him write down the Prince’s officer coxcomb. Come, bind them. Thou naughty varlet!  CONRADE. Away! you are an ass; you are an ass.  DOGBERRY. Dost thou not suspect my place? Dost thou not suspect my years? O that he were here to write me down an ass! but, masters, remember that I am an ass; though it be not written down, yet forget not that I am an ass. No, thou villain, thou art full of piety, as shall be proved upon thee by good witness. I am a wise fellow; and, which is more, an officer; and, which is more, a householder; and, which is more, as pretty a piece of flesh as any in Messina; and one that knows the law, go to; and a rich fellow enough, go to; and a fellow that hath had losses; and one that hath two gowns, and everything handsome about him. Bring him away. O that I had been writ down an ass!  [Exeunt.]
  ACT V  SCENE I. Before Leonato’s House.
Enter Leonato and Antonio.  ANTONIO. If you go on thus, you will kill yourself And ’tis not wisdom thus to second grief Against yourself.  LEONATO. I pray thee, cease thy counsel, Which falls into mine ears as profitless As water in a sieve: give not me counsel; Nor let no comforter delight mine ear But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine: Bring me a father that so lov’d his child, Whose joy of her is overwhelm’d like mine, And bid him speak of patience; Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine, And let it answer every strain for strain, As thus for thus and such a grief for such, In every lineament, branch, shape, and form: If such a one will smile, and stroke his beard; Bid sorrow wag, cry ‘hem’ when he should groan, Patch grief with proverbs; make misfortune drunk With candle-wasters; bring him yet to me, And I of him will gather patience. But there is no such man; for, brother, men Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief Which they themselves not feel; but, tasting it, Their counsel turns to passion, which before Would give preceptial medicine to rage, Fetter strong madness in a silken thread, Charm ache with air and agony with words. No, no; ’tis all men’s office to speak patience To those that wring under the load of sorrow, But no man’s virtue nor sufficiency To be so moral when he shall endure The like himself. Therefore give me no counsel: My griefs cry louder than advertisement.  ANTONIO. Therein do men from children nothing differ.  LEONATO. I pray thee peace! I will be flesh and blood; For there was never yet philosopher That could endure the toothache patiently, However they have writ the style of gods And made a push at chance and sufferance.  ANTONIO. Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself; Make those that do offend you suffer too.  LEONATO. There thou speak’st reason: nay, I will do so. My soul doth tell me Hero is belied; And that shall Claudio know; so shall the Prince, And all of them that thus dishonour her.  ANTONIO. Here comes the Prince and Claudio hastily.  Enter Don Pedro and Claudio.  DON PEDRO. Good den, good den.  CLAUDIO. Good day to both of you.  LEONATO. Hear you, my lords,—  DON PEDRO. We have some haste, Leonato.  LEONATO. Some haste, my lord! well, fare you well, my lord: Are you so hasty now?—well, all is one.  DON PEDRO. Nay, do not quarrel with us, good old man.  ANTONIO. If he could right himself with quarrelling, Some of us would lie low.  CLAUDIO. Who wrongs him?  LEONATO. Marry, thou dost wrong me; thou dissembler, thou. Nay, never lay thy hand upon thy sword; I fear thee not.  CLAUDIO. Marry, beshrew my hand, If it should give your age such cause of fear. In faith, my hand meant nothing to my sword.  LEONATO. Tush, tush, man! never fleer and jest at me: I speak not like a dotard nor a fool, As, under privilege of age, to brag What I have done being young, or what would do, Were I not old. Know, Claudio, to thy head, Thou hast so wrong’d mine innocent child and me That I am forc’d to lay my reverence by, And, with grey hairs and bruise of many days, Do challenge thee to trial of a man. I say thou hast belied mine innocent child: Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart, And she lies buried with her ancestors; O! in a tomb where never scandal slept, Save this of hers, fram’d by thy villainy!  CLAUDIO. My villainy?  LEONATO. Thine, Claudio; thine, I say.  DON PEDRO. You say not right, old man.  LEONATO. My lord, my lord,  I’ll prove it on his body, if he dare, Despite his nice fence and his active practice, His May of youth and bloom of lustihood.  CLAUDIO. Away! I will not have to do with you.  LEONATO. Canst thou so daff me? Thou hast kill’d my child; If thou kill’st me, boy, thou shalt kill a man.  ANTONIO. He shall kill two of us, and men indeed: But that’s no matter; let him kill one first: Win me and wear me; let him answer me. Come, follow me, boy; come, sir boy, come, follow me. Sir boy, I’ll whip you from your foining fence; Nay, as I am a gentleman, I will.  LEONATO. Brother,—  ANTONIO. Content yourself. God knows I lov’d my niece; And she is dead, slander’d to death by villains, That dare as well answer a man indeed As I dare take a serpent by the tongue. Boys, apes, braggarts, Jacks, milksops!  LEONATO. Brother Anthony,—  ANTONIO. Hold you content. What, man! I know them, yea, And what they weigh, even to the utmost scruple, Scambling, out-facing, fashion-monging boys, That lie and cog and flout, deprave and slander, Go antickly, show outward hideousness, And speak off half a dozen dangerous words, How they might hurt their enemies, if they durst; And this is all!  LEONATO. But, brother Anthony,—  ANTONIO. Come, ’tis no matter: Do not you meddle, let me deal in this.  DON PEDRO. Gentlemen both, we will not wake your patience. My heart is sorry for your daughter’s death; But, on my honour, she was charg’d with nothing But what was true and very full of proof.  LEONATO. My lord, my lord—  DON PEDRO. I will not hear you.  LEONATO. No? Come, brother, away. I will be heard.—  ANTONIO. And shall, or some of us will smart for it.  [Exeunt Leonato and Antonio.]  Enter Benedick.  DON PEDRO. See, see; here comes the man we went to seek.  CLAUDIO. Now, signior, what news?  BENEDICK. Good day, my lord.  DON PEDRO. Welcome, signior: you are almost come to part almost a fray.  CLAUDIO. We had like to have had our two noses snapped off with two old men without teeth.  DON PEDRO. Leonato and his brother. What think’st thou? Had we fought, I doubt we should have been too young for them.  BENEDICK. In a false quarrel there is no true valour. I came to seek you both.  CLAUDIO. We have been up and down to seek thee; for we are high-proof melancholy, and would fain have it beaten away. Wilt thou use thy wit?  BENEDICK. It is in my scabbard; shall I draw it?  DON PEDRO. Dost thou wear thy wit by thy side?  CLAUDIO. Never any did so, though very many have been beside their wit. I will bid thee draw, as we do the minstrels; draw, to pleasure us.  DON PEDRO. As I am an honest man, he looks pale. Art thou sick, or angry?  CLAUDIO. What, courage, man! What though care killed a cat, thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care.  BENEDICK. Sir, I shall meet your wit in the career, and you charge it against me. I pray you choose another subject.  CLAUDIO. Nay then, give him another staff: this last was broke cross.  DON PEDRO. By this light, he changes more and more: I think he be angry indeed.  CLAUDIO. If he be, he knows how to turn his girdle.  BENEDICK. Shall I speak a word in your ear?  CLAUDIO. God bless me from a challenge!  BENEDICK. [Aside to Claudio.] You are a villain, I jest not: I will make it good how you dare, with what you dare, and when you dare. Do me right, or I will protest your cowardice. You have killed a sweet lady, and her death shall fall heavy on you. Let me hear from you.  CLAUDIO. Well I will meet you, so I may have good cheer.  DON PEDRO. What, a feast, a feast?  CLAUDIO. I’ faith, I thank him; he hath bid me to a calf’s-head and a capon, the which if I do not carve most curiously, say my knife’s naught. Shall I not find a woodcock too?  BENEDICK. Sir, your wit ambles well; it goes easily.  DON PEDRO. I’ll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit the other day. I said, thou hadst a fine wit. ‘True,’ says she, ‘a fine little one.’ ‘No,’ said I, ‘a great wit.’ ‘Right,’ said she, ‘a great gross one.’ ‘Nay,’ said I, ‘a good wit.’ ‘Just,’ said she, ‘it hurts nobody.’ ‘Nay,’ said I, ‘the gentleman is wise.’ ‘Certain,’ said she, ‘a wise gentleman.’ ‘Nay,’ said I, ‘he hath the tongues.’ ‘That I believe’ said she, ‘for he swore a thing to me on Monday night, which he forswore on Tuesday morning: there’s a double tongue; there’s two tongues.’ Thus did she, an hour together, trans-shape thy particular virtues; yet at last she concluded with a sigh, thou wast the properest man in Italy.  CLAUDIO. For the which she wept heartily and said she cared not.  DON PEDRO. Yea, that she did; but yet, for all that, an if she did not hate him deadly, she would love him dearly. The old man’s daughter told us all.  CLAUDIO. All, all; and moreover, God saw him when he was hid in the garden.  DON PEDRO. But when shall we set the savage bull’s horns on the sensible Benedick’s head?  CLAUDIO. Yea, and text underneath, ‘Here dwells Benedick the married man!’  BENEDICK. Fare you well, boy: you know my mind. I will leave you now to your gossip-like humour; you break jests as braggarts do their blades, which, God be thanked, hurt not. My lord, for your many courtesies I thank you: I must discontinue your company. Your brother the bastard is fled from Messina: you have, among you, killed a sweet and innocent lady. For my Lord Lack-beard there, he and I shall meet; and till then, peace be with him.  [Exit.]  DON PEDRO. He is in earnest.  CLAUDIO. In most profound earnest; and, I’ll warrant you, for the love of Beatrice.  DON PEDRO. And hath challenged thee?  CLAUDIO. Most sincerely.  DON PEDRO. What a pretty thing man is when he goes in his doublet and hose and leaves off his wit!  CLAUDIO. He is then a giant to an ape; but then is an ape a doctor to such a man.  DON PEDRO. But, soft you; let me be: pluck up, my heart, and be sad! Did he not say my brother was fled?  Enter Dogberry, Verges,  and the Watch, with Conrade and Borachio.  DOGBERRY. Come you, sir: if justice cannot tame you, she shall ne’er weigh more reasons in her balance. Nay, an you be a cursing hypocrite once, you must be looked to.  DON PEDRO. How now! two of my brother’s men bound! Borachio, one!  CLAUDIO. Hearken after their offence, my lord.  DON PEDRO. Officers, what offence have these men done?  DOGBERRY. Marry, sir, they have committed false report; moreover, they have spoken untruths; secondarily, they are slanders; sixth and lastly, they have belied a lady; thirdly, they have verified unjust things; and to conclude, they are lying knaves.  DON PEDRO. First, I ask thee what they have done; thirdly, I ask thee what’s their offence; sixth and lastly, why they are committed; and, to conclude, what you lay to their charge?  CLAUDIO. Rightly reasoned, and in his own division; and, by my troth, there’s one meaning well suited.  DON PEDRO. Who have you offended, masters, that you are thus bound to your answer? This learned constable is too cunning to be understood. What’s your offence?  BORACHIO. Sweet Prince, let me go no farther to mine answer: do you hear me, and let this Count kill me. I have deceived even your very eyes: what your wisdoms could not discover, these shallow fools have brought to light; who, in the night overheard me confessing to this man how Don John your brother incensed me to slander the Lady Hero; how you were brought into the orchard and saw me court Margaret in Hero’s garments; how you disgraced her, when you should marry her. My villainy they have upon record; which I had rather seal with my death than repeat over to my shame. The lady is dead upon mine and my master’s false accusation; and, briefly, I desire nothing but the reward of a villain.  DON PEDRO. Runs not this speech like iron through your blood?  CLAUDIO. I have drunk poison whiles he utter’d it.  DON PEDRO. But did my brother set thee on to this?  BORACHIO. Yea; and paid me richly for the practice of it.  DON PEDRO. He is compos’d and fram’d of treachery: And fled he is upon this villainy.  CLAUDIO. Sweet Hero! now thy image doth appear In the rare semblance that I lov’d it first.  DOGBERRY. Come, bring away the plaintiffs: by this time our sexton hath reformed Signior Leonato of the matter. And masters, do not forget to specify, when time and place shall serve, that I am an ass.  VERGES. Here, here comes Master Signior Leonato, and the sexton too.  Re-enter Leonato, Antonio and the Sexton.  LEONATO. Which is the villain? Let me see his eyes, That, when I note another man like him, I may avoid him. Which of these is he?  BORACHIO. If you would know your wronger, look on me.  LEONATO. Art thou the slave that with thy breath hast kill’d Mine innocent child?  BORACHIO. Yea, even I alone.  LEONATO. No, not so, villain; thou beliest thyself: Here stand a pair of honourable men; A third is fled, that had a hand in it. I thank you, princes, for my daughter’s death: Record it with your high and worthy deeds. ’Twas bravely done, if you bethink you of it.  CLAUDIO. I know not how to pray your patience; Yet I must speak. Choose your revenge yourself; Impose me to what penance your invention Can lay upon my sin: yet sinn’d I not But in mistaking.  DON PEDRO. By my soul, nor I: And yet, to satisfy this good old man, I would bend under any heavy weight That he’ll enjoin me to.  LEONATO. I cannot bid you bid my daughter live; That were impossible; but, I pray you both, Possess the people in Messina here How innocent she died; and if your love Can labour aught in sad invention, Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb, And sing it to her bones: sing it tonight. Tomorrow morning come you to my house, And since you could not be my son-in-law, Be yet my nephew. My brother hath a daughter, Almost the copy of my child that’s dead, And she alone is heir to both of us: Give her the right you should have given her cousin, And so dies my revenge.  CLAUDIO. O noble sir, Your over-kindness doth wring tears from me! I do embrace your offer; and dispose For henceforth of poor Claudio.  LEONATO. Tomorrow then I will expect your coming; Tonight I take my leave. This naughty man Shall face to face be brought to Margaret, Who, I believe, was pack’d in all this wrong, Hir’d to it by your brother.  BORACHIO. No, by my soul she was not; Nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me; But always hath been just and virtuous In anything that I do know by her.  DOGBERRY. Moreover, sir,—which, indeed, is not under white and black,— this plaintiff here, the offender, did call me ass: I beseech you, let it be remembered in his punishment. And also, the watch heard them talk of one Deformed: they say he wears a key in his ear and a lock hanging by it, and borrows money in God’s name, the which he hath used so long and never paid, that now men grow hard-hearted, and will lend nothing for God’s sake. Pray you, examine him upon that point.  LEONATO. I thank thee for thy care and honest pains.  DOGBERRY. Your worship speaks like a most thankful and reverent youth, and I praise God for you.  LEONATO. There’s for thy pains.  DOGBERRY. God save the foundation!  LEONATO. Go, I discharge thee of thy prisoner, and I thank thee.  DOGBERRY. I leave an arrant knave with your worship; which I beseech your worship to correct yourself, for the example of others. God keep your worship! I wish your worship well; God restore you to health! I humbly give you leave to depart, and if a merry meeting may be wished, God prohibit it! Come, neighbour.  [Exeunt Dogberry and Verges.]  LEONATO. Until tomorrow morning, lords, farewell.  ANTONIO. Farewell, my lords: we look for you tomorrow.  DON PEDRO. We will not fail.  CLAUDIO. Tonight I’ll mourn with Hero.  [Exeunt Don Pedro and Claudio.]  LEONATO. [To the Watch.] Bring you these fellows on. We’ll talk with Margaret, How her acquaintance grew with this lewd fellow.  [Exeunt.]  SCENE II. Leonato’s Garden.  Enter Benedick and Margaret, meeting.  BENEDICK. Pray thee, sweet Mistress Margaret, deserve well at my hands by helping me to the speech of Beatrice.  MARGARET. Will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty?  BENEDICK. In so high a style, Margaret, that no man living shall come over it; for, in most comely truth, thou deservest it.  MARGARET. To have no man come over me! why, shall I always keep below stairs?  BENEDICK. Thy wit is as quick as the greyhound’s mouth; it catches.  MARGARET. And yours as blunt as the fencer’s foils, which hit, but hurt not.  BENEDICK. A most manly wit, Margaret; it will not hurt a woman: and so, I pray thee, call Beatrice. I give thee the bucklers.  MARGARET. Give us the swords, we have bucklers of our own.  BENEDICK. If you use them, Margaret, you must put in the pikes with a vice; and they are dangerous weapons for maids.  MARGARET. Well, I will call Beatrice to you, who I think hath legs.  BENEDICK. And therefore will come.  [Exit Margaret.]      The god of love,      That sits above,    And knows me, and knows me, How pitiful I deserve,—  I mean, in singing: but in loving, Leander the good swimmer, Troilus the first employer of panders, and a whole book full of these quondam carpet-mongers, whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a blank verse, why, they were never so truly turned over and over as my poor self in love. Marry, I cannot show it in rime; I have tried: I can find out no rime to ‘lady’ but ‘baby’, an innocent rime; for ‘scorn,’ ‘horn’, a hard rime; for ‘school’, ‘fool’, a babbling rime; very ominous endings: no, I was not born under a riming planet, nor I cannot woo in festival terms.  Enter Beatrice.  Sweet Beatrice, wouldst thou come when I called thee?  BEATRICE. Yea, signior; and depart when you bid me.  BENEDICK. O, stay but till then!  BEATRICE. ‘Then’ is spoken; fare you well now: and yet, ere I go, let me go with that I came for; which is, with knowing what hath passed between you and Claudio.  BENEDICK. Only foul words; and thereupon I will kiss thee.  BEATRICE. Foul words is but foul wind, and foul wind is but foul breath, and foul breath is noisome; therefore I will depart unkissed.  BENEDICK. Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense, so forcible is thy wit. But I must tell thee plainly, Claudio undergoes my challenge, and either I must shortly hear from him, or I will subscribe him a coward. And, I pray thee now, tell me, for which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me?  BEATRICE. For them all together; which maintained so politic a state of evil that they will not admit any good part to intermingle with them. But for which of my good parts did you first suffer love for me?  BENEDICK. ‘Suffer love,’ a good epithet! I do suffer love indeed, for I love thee against my will.  BEATRICE. In spite of your heart, I think. Alas, poor heart! If you spite it for my sake, I will spite it for yours; for I will never love that which my friend hates.  BENEDICK. Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably.  BEATRICE. It appears not in this confession: there’s not one wise man among twenty that will praise himself.  BENEDICK. An old, an old instance, Beatrice, that lived in the time of good neighbours. If a man do not erect in this age his own tomb ere he dies, he shall live no longer in monument than the bell rings and the widow weeps.  BEATRICE.  And how long is that think you?  BENEDICK. Question: why, an hour in clamour and a quarter in rheum: therefore is it most expedient for the wise,—if Don Worm, his conscience, find no impediment to the contrary,—to be the trumpet of his own virtues, as I am to myself. So much for praising myself, who, I myself will bear witness, is praiseworthy. And now tell me, how doth your cousin?  BEATRICE. Very ill.  BENEDICK. And how do you?  BEATRICE. Very ill too.  BENEDICK. Serve God, love me, and mend. There will I leave you too, for here comes one in haste.  Enter Ursula.  URSULA. Madam, you must come to your uncle. Yonder’s old coil at home: it is proved, my Lady Hero hath been falsely accused, the Prince and Claudio mightily abused; and Don John is the author of all, who is fled and gone. Will you come presently?  BEATRICE. Will you go hear this news, signior?  BENEDICK. I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be buried in thy eyes; and moreover I will go with thee to thy uncle’s.  [Exeunt.]  SCENE III. The Inside of a Church.  Enter Don Pedro, Claudio and Attendants, with music and tapers.  CLAUDIO. Is this the monument of Leonato?  A LORD. It is, my lord.  CLAUDIO. [Reads from a scroll.]  Epitaph.    Done to death by slanderous tongues      Was the Hero that here lies:     Death, in guerdon of her wrongs,  Gives her fame which never dies. So the life that died with shame  Lives in death with glorious fame.  Hang thou there upon the tomb,  Praising her when I am dumb. Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.  Song.   Pardon, goddess of the night,    Those that slew thy virgin knight;     For the which, with songs of woe,      Round about her tomb they go.    Midnight, assist our moan;     Help us to sigh and groan,   Heavily, heavily: Graves, yawn and yield your dead,  Till death be uttered,   Heavily, heavily.  CLAUDIO. Now, unto thy bones good night! Yearly will I do this rite.  DON PEDRO. Good morrow, masters: put your torches out. The wolves have prey’d; and look, the gentle day, Before the wheels of Phoebus, round about Dapples the drowsy East with spots of grey. Thanks to you all, and leave us: fare you well.  CLAUDIO. Good morrow, masters: each his several way.  DON PEDRO. Come, let us hence, and put on other weeds; And then to Leonato’s we will go.  CLAUDIO. And Hymen now with luckier issue speed’s, Than this for whom we rend’red up this woe!  [Exeunt.]  SCENE IV. A Room in Leonato’s House.  Enter Leonato, Antonio, Benedick, Beatrice, Margaret, Ursula, Friar Francis and Hero.  FRIAR. Did I not tell you she was innocent?  LEONATO. So are the Prince and Claudio, who accus’d her Upon the error that you heard debated: But Margaret was in some fault for this, Although against her will, as it appears In the true course of all the question.  ANTONIO. Well, I am glad that all things sort so well.  BENEDICK. And so am I, being else by faith enforc’d To call young Claudio to a reckoning for it.  LEONATO. Well, daughter, and you gentlewomen all, Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves, And when I send for you, come hither mask’d: The Prince and Claudio promis’d by this hour To visit me.  [Exeunt Ladies.]  You know your office, brother; You must be father to your brother’s daughter, And give her to young Claudio.  ANTONIO. Which I will do with confirm’d countenance.  BENEDICK. Friar, I must entreat your pains, I think.  FRIAR. To do what, signior?  BENEDICK. To bind me, or undo me; one of them. Signior Leonato, truth it is, good signior, Your niece regards me with an eye of favour.  LEONATO. That eye my daughter lent her. ’Tis most true.  BENEDICK. And I do with an eye of love requite her.  LEONATO. The sight whereof I think, you had from me, From Claudio, and the Prince. But what’s your will?  BENEDICK. Your answer, sir, is enigmatical: But, for my will, my will is your good will May stand with ours, this day to be conjoin’d In the state of honourable marriage: In which, good friar, I shall desire your help.  LEONATO. My heart is with your liking.  FRIAR. And my help. Here comes the Prince and Claudio.  Enter Don Pedro and Claudio, with Attendants.  DON PEDRO. Good morrow to this fair assembly.  LEONATO. Good morrow, Prince; good morrow, Claudio: We here attend you. Are you yet determin’d Today to marry with my brother’s daughter?  CLAUDIO. I’ll hold my mind, were she an Ethiope.  LEONATO. Call her forth, brother: here’s the friar ready.  [Exit Antonio.]  DON PEDRO. Good morrow, Benedick. Why, what’s the matter, That you have such a February face, So full of frost, of storm and cloudiness?  CLAUDIO. I think he thinks upon the savage bull. Tush! fear not, man, we’ll tip thy horns with gold, And all Europa shall rejoice at thee, As once Europa did at lusty Jove, When he would play the noble beast in love.  BENEDICK. Bull Jove, sir, had an amiable low: And some such strange bull leap’d your father’s cow, And got a calf in that same noble feat, Much like to you, for you have just his bleat.  CLAUDIO. For this I owe you: here comes other reckonings.  Re-enter Antonio, with the ladies masked.  Which is the lady I must seize upon?  ANTONIO. This same is she, and I do give you her.  CLAUDIO. Why then, she’s mine. Sweet, let me see your face.  LEONATO. No, that you shall not, till you take her hand Before this friar, and swear to marry her.  CLAUDIO. Give me your hand: before this holy friar, I am your husband, if you like of me.  HERO. And when I liv’d, I was your other wife: [Unmasking.] And when you lov’d, you were my other husband.  CLAUDIO. Another Hero!  HERO. Nothing certainer: One Hero died defil’d, but I do live, And surely as I live, I am a maid.  DON PEDRO. The former Hero! Hero that is dead!  LEONATO. She died, my lord, but whiles her slander liv’d.  FRIAR. All this amazement can I qualify: When after that the holy rites are ended, I’ll tell you largely of fair Hero’s death: Meantime, let wonder seem familiar, And to the chapel let us presently.  BENEDICK. Soft and fair, friar. Which is Beatrice?  BEATRICE. [Unmasking.] I answer to that name. What is your will?  BENEDICK. Do not you love me?  BEATRICE. Why, no; no more than reason.  BENEDICK. Why, then, your uncle and the Prince and Claudio Have been deceived; for they swore you did.  BEATRICE. Do not you love me?  BENEDICK. Troth, no; no more than reason.  BEATRICE. Why, then my cousin, Margaret, and Ursula, Are much deceiv’d; for they did swear you did.  BENEDICK. They swore that you were almost sick for me.  BEATRICE. They swore that you were well-nigh dead for me.  BENEDICK. ’Tis no such matter. Then you do not love me?  BEATRICE. No, truly, but in friendly recompense.  LEONATO. Come, cousin, I am sure you love the gentleman.  CLAUDIO. And I’ll be sworn upon ’t that he loves her; For here’s a paper written in his hand, A halting sonnet of his own pure brain, Fashion’d to Beatrice.  HERO. And here’s another, Writ in my cousin’s hand, stolen from her pocket, Containing her affection unto Benedick.  BENEDICK. A miracle! here’s our own hands against our hearts. Come, I will have thee; but, by this light, I take thee for pity.  BEATRICE. I would not deny you; but, by this good day, I yield upon great persuasion, and partly to save your life, for I was told you were in a consumption.  BENEDICK. Peace! I will stop your mouth. [Kisses her.]  DON PEDRO. How dost thou, Benedick, the married man?  BENEDICK. I’ll tell thee what, Prince; a college of witcrackers cannot flout me out of my humour. Dost thou think I care for a satire or an epigram? No; if man will be beaten with brains, a’ shall wear nothing handsome about him. In brief, since I do purpose to marry, I will think nothing to any purpose that the world can say against it; and therefore never flout at me for what I have said against it, for man is a giddy thing, and this is my conclusion. For thy part, Claudio, I did think to have beaten thee; but, in that thou art like to be my kinsman, live unbruised, and love my cousin.  CLAUDIO. I had well hoped thou wouldst have denied Beatrice, that I might have cudgelled thee out of thy single life, to make thee a double-dealer; which, out of question, thou wilt be, if my cousin do not look exceeding narrowly to thee.  BENEDICK. Come, come, we are friends. Let’s have a dance ere we are married, that we may lighten our own hearts and our wives’ heels.  LEONATO. We’ll have dancing afterward.  BENEDICK. First, of my word; therefore play, music! Prince, thou art sad; get thee a wife, get thee a wife: there is no staff more reverent than one tipped with horn.  Enter Messenger.  MESSENGER. My lord, your brother John is ta’en in flight, And brought with armed men back to Messina.  BENEDICK. Think not on him till tomorrow: I’ll devise thee brave punishments for him. Strike up, pipers!  [Dance. Exeunt.]

  Dramatis Personæ  DUKE OF VENICE BRABANTIO, a Senator of Venice and Desdemona’s father Other Senators GRATIANO, Brother to Brabantio LODOVICO, Kinsman to Brabantio OTHELLO, a noble Moor in the service of Venice CASSIO, his Lieutenant IAGO, his Ancient MONTANO, Othello’s predecessor in the government of Cyprus RODERIGO, a Venetian Gentleman CLOWN, Servant to Othello  DESDEMONA, Daughter to Brabantio and Wife to Othello EMILIA, Wife to Iago BIANCA, Mistress to Cassio  Officers, Gentlemen, Messenger, Musicians, Herald, Sailor, Attendants, &c.  SCENE: The First Act in Venice; during the rest of the Play at a Seaport in Cyprus.
  ACT I  SCENE I. Venice. A street.
Enter Roderigo and Iago.  RODERIGO. Tush, never tell me, I take it much unkindly That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse, As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.  IAGO. ’Sblood, but you will not hear me. If ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me.  RODERIGO. Thou told’st me, thou didst hold him in thy hate.  IAGO. Despise me if I do not. Three great ones of the city, In personal suit to make me his lieutenant, Off-capp’d to him; and by the faith of man, I know my price, I am worth no worse a place. But he, as loving his own pride and purposes, Evades them, with a bombast circumstance, Horribly stuff’d with epithets of war: And in conclusion, Nonsuits my mediators: for “Certes,” says he, “I have already chose my officer.” And what was he? Forsooth, a great arithmetician, One Michael Cassio, a Florentine, A fellow almost damn’d in a fair wife, That never set a squadron in the field, Nor the division of a battle knows More than a spinster, unless the bookish theoric, Wherein the toged consuls can propose As masterly as he: mere prattle without practice Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election, And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof At Rhodes, at Cyprus, and on other grounds, Christian and heathen, must be belee’d and calm’d By debitor and creditor, this counter-caster, He, in good time, must his lieutenant be, And I, God bless the mark, his Moorship’s ancient.  RODERIGO. By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.  IAGO. Why, there’s no remedy. ’Tis the curse of service, Preferment goes by letter and affection, And not by old gradation, where each second Stood heir to the first. Now sir, be judge yourself Whether I in any just term am affin’d To love the Moor.  RODERIGO. I would not follow him, then.  IAGO. O, sir, content you. I follow him to serve my turn upon him: We cannot all be masters, nor all masters Cannot be truly follow’d. You shall mark Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave That, doting on his own obsequious bondage, Wears out his time, much like his master’s ass, For nought but provender, and when he’s old, cashier’d. Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are Who, trimm’d in forms, and visages of duty, Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves, And throwing but shows of service on their lords, Do well thrive by them, and when they have lin’d their coats, Do themselves homage. These fellows have some soul, And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir, It is as sure as you are Roderigo, Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago: In following him, I follow but myself. Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty, But seeming so for my peculiar end. For when my outward action doth demonstrate The native act and figure of my heart In complement extern, ’tis not long after But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.  RODERIGO. What a full fortune does the thick-lips owe, If he can carry’t thus!  IAGO. Call up her father, Rouse him, make after him, poison his delight, Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen, And though he in a fertile climate dwell, Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy, Yet throw such changes of vexation on’t, As it may lose some color.  RODERIGO. Here is her father’s house, I’ll call aloud.  IAGO. Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell As when, by night and negligence, the fire Is spied in populous cities.  RODERIGO. What ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!  IAGO. Awake! what ho, Brabantio! Thieves, thieves! Look to your house, your daughter, and your bags! Thieves, thieves!  Brabantio appears above at a window.  BRABANTIO. What is the reason of this terrible summons? What is the matter there?  RODERIGO. Signior, is all your family within?  IAGO. Are your doors locked?  BRABANTIO. Why, wherefore ask you this?  IAGO. Zounds, sir, you’re robb’d, for shame put on your gown, Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul; Even now, now, very now, an old black ram Is tupping your white ewe. Arise, arise, Awake the snorting citizens with the bell, Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you: Arise, I say.  BRABANTIO. What, have you lost your wits?  RODERIGO. Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?  BRABANTIO. Not I. What are you?  RODERIGO. My name is Roderigo.  BRABANTIO. The worser welcome. I have charg’d thee not to haunt about my doors; In honest plainness thou hast heard me say My daughter is not for thee; and now in madness, Being full of supper and distempering draughts, Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come To start my quiet.  RODERIGO. Sir, sir, sir,—  BRABANTIO. But thou must needs be sure My spirit and my place have in them power To make this bitter to thee.  RODERIGO. Patience, good sir.  BRABANTIO. What tell’st thou me of robbing? This is Venice. My house is not a grange.  RODERIGO. Most grave Brabantio, In simple and pure soul I come to you.  IAGO. Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not serve God if the devil bid you. Because we come to do you service, and you think we are ruffians, you’ll have your daughter cover’d with a Barbary horse; you’ll have your nephews neigh to you; you’ll have coursers for cousins and gennets for germans.  BRABANTIO. What profane wretch art thou?  IAGO. I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.  BRABANTIO. Thou art a villain.  IAGO. You are a senator.  BRABANTIO. This thou shalt answer. I know thee, Roderigo.  RODERIGO. Sir, I will answer anything. But I beseech you, If ’t be your pleasure, and most wise consent, (As partly I find it is) that your fair daughter, At this odd-even and dull watch o’ the night, Transported with no worse nor better guard, But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier, To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor: If this be known to you, and your allowance, We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs. But if you know not this, my manners tell me, We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe That from the sense of all civility, I thus would play and trifle with your reverence. Your daughter (if you have not given her leave) I say again, hath made a gross revolt, Tying her duty, beauty, wit, and fortunes In an extravagant and wheeling stranger Of here and everywhere. Straight satisfy yourself: If she be in her chamber or your house, Let loose on me the justice of the state For thus deluding you.  BRABANTIO. Strike on the tinder, ho! Give me a taper! Call up all my people! This accident is not unlike my dream, Belief of it oppresses me already. Light, I say, light!  [_Exit from above._]  IAGO. Farewell; for I must leave you: It seems not meet nor wholesome to my place To be produc’d, as if I stay I shall, Against the Moor. For I do know the state, However this may gall him with some check, Cannot with safety cast him, for he’s embark’d With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars, Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls, Another of his fathom they have none To lead their business. In which regard, Though I do hate him as I do hell pains, Yet, for necessity of present life, I must show out a flag and sign of love, Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him, Lead to the Sagittary the raised search, And there will I be with him. So, farewell.  [_Exit._]  Enter Brabantio with Servants and torches.  BRABANTIO. It is too true an evil. Gone she is, And what’s to come of my despised time, Is naught but bitterness. Now Roderigo, Where didst thou see her? (O unhappy girl!) With the Moor, say’st thou? (Who would be a father!) How didst thou know ’twas she? (O, she deceives me Past thought.) What said she to you? Get more tapers, Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you?  RODERIGO. Truly I think they are.  BRABANTIO. O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood! Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters’ minds By what you see them act. Is there not charms By which the property of youth and maidhood May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo, Of some such thing?  RODERIGO. Yes, sir, I have indeed.  BRABANTIO. Call up my brother. O, would you had had her! Some one way, some another. Do you know Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?  RODERIGO. I think I can discover him, if you please To get good guard, and go along with me.  BRABANTIO. Pray you lead on. At every house I’ll call, I may command at most. Get weapons, ho! And raise some special officers of night. On, good Roderigo. I will deserve your pains.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. Venice. Another street.  Enter Othello, Iago and Attendants with torches.  IAGO. Though in the trade of war I have slain men, Yet do I hold it very stuff o’ the conscience To do no contriv’d murder; I lack iniquity Sometimes to do me service: nine or ten times I had thought to have yerk’d him here under the ribs.  OTHELLO. ’Tis better as it is.  IAGO. Nay, but he prated, And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms Against your honour, That with the little godliness I have, I did full hard forbear him. But I pray you, sir, Are you fast married? Be assur’d of this, That the magnifico is much belov’d And hath in his effect a voice potential As double as the duke’s; he will divorce you, Or put upon you what restraint and grievance The law (with all his might to enforce it on) Will give him cable.  OTHELLO. Let him do his spite; My services, which I have done the signiory, Shall out-tongue his complaints. ’Tis yet to know,— Which, when I know that boasting is an honour, I shall promulgate,—I fetch my life and being From men of royal siege. And my demerits May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune As this that I have reach’d. For know, Iago, But that I love the gentle Desdemona, I would not my unhoused free condition Put into circumscription and confine For the sea’s worth. But look, what lights come yond?  IAGO. Those are the raised father and his friends: You were best go in.  OTHELLO. Not I; I must be found. My parts, my title, and my perfect soul Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they?  IAGO. By Janus, I think no.  Enter Cassio and Officers with torches.  OTHELLO. The servants of the duke and my lieutenant. The goodness of the night upon you, friends! What is the news?  CASSIO. The duke does greet you, general, And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance Even on the instant.  OTHELLO. What is the matter, think you?  CASSIO. Something from Cyprus, as I may divine. It is a business of some heat. The galleys Have sent a dozen sequent messengers This very night at one another’s heels; And many of the consuls, rais’d and met, Are at the duke’s already. You have been hotly call’d for, When, being not at your lodging to be found, The senate hath sent about three several quests To search you out.  OTHELLO. ’Tis well I am found by you. I will but spend a word here in the house, And go with you.  [_Exit._]  CASSIO. Ancient, what makes he here?  IAGO. Faith, he tonight hath boarded a land carrack: If it prove lawful prize, he’s made forever.  CASSIO. I do not understand.  IAGO. He’s married.  CASSIO. To who?  Enter Othello.  IAGO. Marry to—Come, captain, will you go?  OTHELLO. Have with you.  CASSIO. Here comes another troop to seek for you.  Enter Brabantio, Roderigo and Officers with torches and weapons.  IAGO. It is Brabantio. General, be advis’d, He comes to bad intent.  OTHELLO. Holla, stand there!  RODERIGO. Signior, it is the Moor.  BRABANTIO. Down with him, thief!  [_They draw on both sides._]  IAGO. You, Roderigo! Come, sir, I am for you.  OTHELLO. Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them. Good signior, you shall more command with years Than with your weapons.  BRABANTIO. O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow’d my daughter? Damn’d as thou art, thou hast enchanted her, For I’ll refer me to all things of sense, (If she in chains of magic were not bound) Whether a maid so tender, fair, and happy, So opposite to marriage, that she shunn’d The wealthy curled darlings of our nation, Would ever have, to incur a general mock, Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom Of such a thing as thou—to fear, not to delight. Judge me the world, if ’tis not gross in sense, That thou hast practis’d on her with foul charms, Abus’d her delicate youth with drugs or minerals That weakens motion. I’ll have’t disputed on; ’Tis probable, and palpable to thinking. I therefore apprehend and do attach thee For an abuser of the world, a practiser Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.— Lay hold upon him, if he do resist, Subdue him at his peril.  OTHELLO. Hold your hands, Both you of my inclining and the rest: Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it Without a prompter. Where will you that I go To answer this your charge?  BRABANTIO. To prison, till fit time Of law and course of direct session Call thee to answer.  OTHELLO. What if I do obey? How may the duke be therewith satisfied, Whose messengers are here about my side, Upon some present business of the state, To bring me to him?  OFFICER. ’Tis true, most worthy signior, The duke’s in council, and your noble self, I am sure is sent for.  BRABANTIO. How? The duke in council? In this time of the night? Bring him away; Mine’s not an idle cause. The duke himself, Or any of my brothers of the state, Cannot but feel this wrong as ’twere their own. For if such actions may have passage free, Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. Venice. A council chamber.  The Duke and Senators sitting at a table; Officers attending.  DUKE. There is no composition in these news That gives them credit.  FIRST SENATOR. Indeed, they are disproportion’d; My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.  DUKE. And mine a hundred and forty.  SECOND SENATOR And mine two hundred: But though they jump not on a just account, (As in these cases, where the aim reports, ’Tis oft with difference,) yet do they all confirm A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.  DUKE. Nay, it is possible enough to judgement: I do not so secure me in the error, But the main article I do approve In fearful sense.  SAILOR. [_Within._] What, ho! what, ho! what, ho!  OFFICER. A messenger from the galleys.  Enter Sailor.  DUKE. Now,—what’s the business?  SAILOR. The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes, So was I bid report here to the state By Signior Angelo.  DUKE. How say you by this change?  FIRST SENATOR. This cannot be By no assay of reason. ’Tis a pageant To keep us in false gaze. When we consider The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk; And let ourselves again but understand That, as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes, So may he with more facile question bear it, For that it stands not in such warlike brace, But altogether lacks the abilities That Rhodes is dress’d in. If we make thought of this, We must not think the Turk is so unskilful To leave that latest which concerns him first, Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain, To wake and wage a danger profitless.  DUKE. Nay, in all confidence, he’s not for Rhodes.  OFFICER. Here is more news.  Enter a Messenger.  MESSENGER. The Ottomites, reverend and gracious, Steering with due course toward the isle of Rhodes, Have there injointed them with an after fleet.  FIRST SENATOR. Ay, so I thought. How many, as you guess?  MESSENGER. Of thirty sail, and now they do re-stem Their backward course, bearing with frank appearance Their purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano, Your trusty and most valiant servitor, With his free duty recommends you thus, And prays you to believe him.  DUKE. ’Tis certain, then, for Cyprus. Marcus Luccicos, is not he in town?  FIRST SENATOR. He’s now in Florence.  DUKE. Write from us to him; post-post-haste dispatch.  FIRST SENATOR. Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.  Enter Brabantio, Othello, Iago, Roderigo and Officers.  DUKE. Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you Against the general enemy Ottoman. [_To Brabantio._] I did not see you; welcome, gentle signior, We lack’d your counsel and your help tonight.  BRABANTIO. So did I yours. Good your grace, pardon me. Neither my place, nor aught I heard of business Hath rais’d me from my bed, nor doth the general care Take hold on me; for my particular grief Is of so flood-gate and o’erbearing nature That it engluts and swallows other sorrows, And it is still itself.  DUKE. Why, what’s the matter?  BRABANTIO. My daughter! O, my daughter!  DUKE and SENATORS. Dead?  BRABANTIO. Ay, to me. She is abused, stol’n from me, and corrupted By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks; For nature so preposterously to err, Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense, Sans witchcraft could not.  DUKE. Whoe’er he be, that in this foul proceeding, Hath thus beguil’d your daughter of herself, And you of her, the bloody book of law You shall yourself read in the bitter letter, After your own sense, yea, though our proper son Stood in your action.  BRABANTIO. Humbly I thank your grace. Here is the man, this Moor, whom now it seems Your special mandate for the state affairs Hath hither brought.  ALL. We are very sorry for ’t.  DUKE. [_To Othello._] What, in your own part, can you say to this?  BRABANTIO. Nothing, but this is so.  OTHELLO. Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors, My very noble and approv’d good masters: That I have ta’en away this old man’s daughter, It is most true; true, I have married her. The very head and front of my offending Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech, And little bless’d with the soft phrase of peace; For since these arms of mine had seven years’ pith, Till now some nine moons wasted, they have us’d Their dearest action in the tented field, And little of this great world can I speak, More than pertains to feats of broil and battle, And therefore little shall I grace my cause In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience, I will a round unvarnish’d tale deliver Of my whole course of love: what drugs, what charms, What conjuration, and what mighty magic, (For such proceeding I am charged withal) I won his daughter.  BRABANTIO. A maiden never bold: Of spirit so still and quiet that her motion Blush’d at herself; and she, in spite of nature, Of years, of country, credit, everything, To fall in love with what she fear’d to look on! It is judgement maim’d and most imperfect That will confess perfection so could err Against all rules of nature, and must be driven To find out practices of cunning hell, Why this should be. I therefore vouch again, That with some mixtures powerful o’er the blood, Or with some dram conjur’d to this effect, He wrought upon her.  DUKE. To vouch this is no proof; Without more wider and more overt test Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods Of modern seeming do prefer against him.  FIRST SENATOR. But, Othello, speak: Did you by indirect and forced courses Subdue and poison this young maid’s affections? Or came it by request, and such fair question As soul to soul affordeth?  OTHELLO. I do beseech you, Send for the lady to the Sagittary, And let her speak of me before her father. If you do find me foul in her report, The trust, the office I do hold of you, Not only take away, but let your sentence Even fall upon my life.  DUKE. Fetch Desdemona hither.  OTHELLO. Ancient, conduct them, you best know the place.  [_Exeunt Iago and Attendants._]  And till she come, as truly as to heaven I do confess the vices of my blood, So justly to your grave ears I’ll present How I did thrive in this fair lady’s love, And she in mine.  DUKE. Say it, Othello.  OTHELLO. Her father lov’d me, oft invited me, Still question’d me the story of my life, From year to year—the battles, sieges, fortunes, That I have pass’d. I ran it through, even from my boyish days To the very moment that he bade me tell it, Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances, Of moving accidents by flood and field; Of hair-breadth scapes i’ th’ imminent deadly breach; Of being taken by the insolent foe, And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence, And portance in my traveler’s history, Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle, Rough quarries, rocks, and hills whose heads touch heaven, It was my hint to speak,—such was the process; And of the Cannibals that each other eat, The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear Would Desdemona seriously incline. But still the house affairs would draw her thence, Which ever as she could with haste dispatch, She’d come again, and with a greedy ear Devour up my discourse; which I observing, Took once a pliant hour, and found good means To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart That I would all my pilgrimage dilate, Whereof by parcels she had something heard, But not intentively. I did consent, And often did beguile her of her tears, When I did speak of some distressful stroke That my youth suffer’d. My story being done, She gave me for my pains a world of sighs. She swore, in faith, ’twas strange, ’twas passing strange; ’Twas pitiful, ’twas wondrous pitiful. She wish’d she had not heard it, yet she wish’d That heaven had made her such a man: she thank’d me, And bade me, if I had a friend that lov’d her, I should but teach him how to tell my story, And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake: She lov’d me for the dangers I had pass’d, And I lov’d her that she did pity them. This only is the witchcraft I have us’d. Here comes the lady. Let her witness it.  Enter  Desdemona, Iago and Attendants.  DUKE. I think this tale would win my daughter too. Good Brabantio, Take up this mangled matter at the best. Men do their broken weapons rather use Than their bare hands.  BRABANTIO. I pray you hear her speak. If she confess that she was half the wooer, Destruction on my head, if my bad blame Light on the man!—Come hither, gentle mistress: Do you perceive in all this noble company Where most you owe obedience?  DESDEMONA. My noble father, I do perceive here a divided duty: To you I am bound for life and education. My life and education both do learn me How to respect you. You are the lord of duty, I am hitherto your daughter: but here’s my husband. And so much duty as my mother show’d To you, preferring you before her father, So much I challenge that I may profess Due to the Moor my lord.  BRABANTIO. God be with you! I have done. Please it your grace, on to the state affairs. I had rather to adopt a child than get it.— Come hither, Moor: I here do give thee that with all my heart Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart I would keep from thee.—For your sake, jewel, I am glad at soul I have no other child, For thy escape would teach me tyranny, To hang clogs on them.—I have done, my lord.  DUKE. Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence, Which as a grise or step may help these lovers Into your favour. When remedies are past, the griefs are ended By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended. To mourn a mischief that is past and gone Is the next way to draw new mischief on. What cannot be preserved when fortune takes, Patience her injury a mockery makes. The robb’d that smiles steals something from the thief; He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.  BRABANTIO. So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile, We lose it not so long as we can smile; He bears the sentence well, that nothing bears But the free comfort which from thence he hears; But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow. These sentences to sugar or to gall, Being strong on both sides, are equivocal: But words are words; I never yet did hear That the bruis’d heart was pierced through the ear. I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state.  DUKE. The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus. Othello, the fortitude of the place is best known to you. And though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, a sovereign mistress of effects, throws a more safer voice on you: you must therefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boisterous expedition.  OTHELLO. The tyrant custom, most grave senators, Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war My thrice-driven bed of down: I do agnize A natural and prompt alacrity I find in hardness, and do undertake This present wars against the Ottomites. Most humbly, therefore, bending to your state, I crave fit disposition for my wife, Due reference of place and exhibition, With such accommodation and besort As levels with her breeding.  DUKE. If you please, Be’t at her father’s.  BRABANTIO. I’ll not have it so.  OTHELLO. Nor I.  DESDEMONA. Nor I. I would not there reside, To put my father in impatient thoughts, By being in his eye. Most gracious duke, To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear, And let me find a charter in your voice T’ assist my simpleness.  DUKE. What would you, Desdemona?  DESDEMONA. That I did love the Moor to live with him, My downright violence and storm of fortunes May trumpet to the world: my heart’s subdued Even to the very quality of my lord. I saw Othello’s visage in his mind, And to his honours and his valiant parts Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate. So that, dear lords, if I be left behind, A moth of peace, and he go to the war, The rites for which I love him are bereft me, And I a heavy interim shall support By his dear absence. Let me go with him.  OTHELLO. Let her have your voice. Vouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not To please the palate of my appetite, Nor to comply with heat, the young affects In me defunct, and proper satisfaction, But to be free and bounteous to her mind. And heaven defend your good souls that you think I will your serious and great business scant For she is with me. No, when light-wing’d toys Of feather’d Cupid seel with wanton dullness My speculative and offic’d instruments, That my disports corrupt and taint my business, Let housewives make a skillet of my helm, And all indign and base adversities Make head against my estimation.  DUKE. Be it as you shall privately determine, Either for her stay or going. The affair cries haste, And speed must answer it.  FIRST SENATOR. You must away tonight.  OTHELLO. With all my heart.  DUKE. At nine i’ the morning here we’ll meet again. Othello, leave some officer behind, And he shall our commission bring to you, With such things else of quality and respect As doth import you.  OTHELLO. So please your grace, my ancient, A man he is of honesty and trust, To his conveyance I assign my wife, With what else needful your good grace shall think To be sent after me.  DUKE. Let it be so. Good night to everyone. [_To Brabantio._] And, noble signior, If virtue no delighted beauty lack, Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.  FIRST SENATOR. Adieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well.  BRABANTIO. Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see: She has deceiv’d her father, and may thee.  [_Exeunt Duke, Senators, Officers, &c._]  OTHELLO. My life upon her faith! Honest Iago, My Desdemona must I leave to thee. I prithee, let thy wife attend on her, And bring them after in the best advantage.— Come, Desdemona, I have but an hour Of love, of worldly matters, and direction, To spend with thee. We must obey the time.  [_Exeunt Othello and Desdemona._]  RODERIGO. Iago—  IAGO. What sayst thou, noble heart?  RODERIGO. What will I do, thinkest thou?  IAGO. Why, go to bed and sleep.  RODERIGO. I will incontinently drown myself.  IAGO. If thou dost, I shall never love thee after. Why, thou silly gentleman!  RODERIGO. It is silliness to live, when to live is torment; and then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician.  IAGO. O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four times seven years, and since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found man that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say I would drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen, I would change my humanity with a baboon.  RODERIGO. What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so fond, but it is not in my virtue to amend it.  IAGO. Virtue! a fig! ’Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus. Our bodies are gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners. So that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many, either to have it sterile with idleness or manured with industry, why, the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills. If the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions. But we have reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal stings, our unbitted lusts; whereof I take this, that you call love, to be a sect, or scion.  RODERIGO. It cannot be.  IAGO. It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will. Come, be a man. Drown thyself? Drown cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy friend, and I confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness; I could never better stead thee than now. Put money in thy purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour with an usurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse. It cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her love to the Moor,—put money in thy purse,—nor he his to her. It was a violent commencement, and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration—put but money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in their wills. Fill thy purse with money. The food that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as acerb as the coloquintida. She must change for youth. When she is sated with his body, she will find the error of her choice. She must have change, she must. Therefore put money in thy purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money thou canst. If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of drowning thyself! It is clean out of the way: seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her.  RODERIGO. Wilt thou be fast to my hopes if I depend on the issue?  IAGO. Thou art sure of me. Go, make money. I have told thee often, and I retell thee again and again, I hate the Moor. My cause is hearted; thine hath no less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him: if thou canst cuckold him, thou dost thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered. Traverse, go, provide thy money. We will have more of this tomorrow. Adieu.  RODERIGO. Where shall we meet i’ the morning?  IAGO. At my lodging.  RODERIGO. I’ll be with thee betimes.  IAGO. Go to, farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?  RODERIGO. What say you?  IAGO. No more of drowning, do you hear?  RODERIGO. I am changed. I’ll sell all my land.  [_Exit._]  IAGO. Thus do I ever make my fool my purse. For I mine own gain’d knowledge should profane If I would time expend with such a snipe But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor, And it is thought abroad that ’twixt my sheets He has done my office. I know not if ’t be true, But I, for mere suspicion in that kind, Will do as if for surety. He holds me well, The better shall my purpose work on him. Cassio’s a proper man. Let me see now, To get his place, and to plume up my will In double knavery. How, how? Let’s see. After some time, to abuse Othello’s ear That he is too familiar with his wife. He hath a person and a smooth dispose, To be suspected, fram’d to make women false. The Moor is of a free and open nature That thinks men honest that but seem to be so, And will as tenderly be led by the nose As asses are. I have’t. It is engender’d. Hell and night Must bring this monstrous birth to the world’s light.  [_Exit._]
  ACT II  SCENE I. A seaport in Cyprus. A Platform.
[_Montano is led off._]  Iago, look with care about the town, And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted. Come, Desdemona: ’tis the soldiers’ life To have their balmy slumbers wak’d with strife.  [_Exeunt all but Iago and Cassio._]  IAGO. What, are you hurt, lieutenant?  CASSIO. Ay, past all surgery.  IAGO. Marry, Heaven forbid!  CASSIO. Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have lost my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of myself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation, Iago, my reputation!  IAGO. As I am an honest man, I thought you had received some bodily wound; there is more sense in that than in reputation. Reputation is an idle and most false imposition, oft got without merit and lost without deserving. You have lost no reputation at all, unless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man, there are ways to recover the general again: you are but now cast in his mood, a punishment more in policy than in malice, even so as one would beat his offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion: sue to him again, and he’s yours.  CASSIO. I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight, so drunken, and so indiscreet an officer. Drunk? and speak parrot? and squabble? swagger? swear? and discourse fustian with one’s own shadow? O thou invisible spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by, let us call thee devil!  IAGO. What was he that you followed with your sword? What had he done to you?  CASSIO. I know not.  IAGO. Is’t possible?  CASSIO. I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly; a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O God, that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains! That we should with joy, pleasance, revel, and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!  IAGO. Why, but you are now well enough: how came you thus recovered?  CASSIO. It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath. One unperfectness shows me another, to make me frankly despise myself.  IAGO. Come, you are too severe a moraler. As the time, the place, and the condition of this country stands, I could heartily wish this had not befallen; but since it is as it is, mend it for your own good.  CASSIO. I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra, such an answer would stop them all. To be now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a beast! O strange! Every inordinate cup is unbless’d, and the ingredient is a devil.  IAGO. Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature, if it be well used. Exclaim no more against it. And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.  CASSIO. I have well approved it, sir.—I drunk!  IAGO. You, or any man living, may be drunk at a time, man. I’ll tell you what you shall do. Our general’s wife is now the general; I may say so in this respect, for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and graces. Confess yourself freely to her. Importune her help to put you in your place again. She is of so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition, she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested. This broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter, and, my fortunes against any lay worth naming, this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.  CASSIO. You advise me well.  IAGO. I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.  CASSIO. I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me; I am desperate of my fortunes if they check me here.  IAGO. You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant, I must to the watch.  CASSIO. Good night, honest Iago.  [_Exit._]  IAGO. And what’s he then, that says I play the villain? When this advice is free I give and honest, Probal to thinking, and indeed the course To win the Moor again? For ’tis most easy The inclining Desdemona to subdue In any honest suit. She’s fram’d as fruitful As the free elements. And then for her To win the Moor, were’t to renounce his baptism, All seals and symbols of redeemed sin, His soul is so enfetter’d to her love That she may make, unmake, do what she list, Even as her appetite shall play the god With his weak function. How am I then, a villain To counsel Cassio to this parallel course, Directly to his good? Divinity of hell! When devils will the blackest sins put on, They do suggest at first with heavenly shows, As I do now: for whiles this honest fool Plies Desdemona to repair his fortune, And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor, I’ll pour this pestilence into his ear, That she repeals him for her body’s lust; And by how much she strives to do him good, She shall undo her credit with the Moor. So will I turn her virtue into pitch, And out of her own goodness make the net That shall enmesh them all.  Enter Roderigo.  How now, Roderigo?  RODERIGO. I do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that hunts, but one that fills up the cry. My money is almost spent, I have been tonight exceedingly well cudgelled; and I think the issue will be, I shall have so much experience for my pains, and so, with no money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice.  IAGO. How poor are they that have not patience! What wound did ever heal but by degrees? Thou know’st we work by wit, and not by witchcraft, And wit depends on dilatory time. Does’t not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee, And thou, by that small hurt, hast cashier’d Cassio; Though other things grow fair against the sun, Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe. Content thyself awhile. By the mass, ’tis morning; Pleasure and action make the hours seem short. Retire thee; go where thou art billeted. Away, I say, thou shalt know more hereafter. Nay, get thee gone.  [_Exit Roderigo._]  Two things are to be done, My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress. I’ll set her on; Myself the while to draw the Moor apart, And bring him jump when he may Cassio find Soliciting his wife. Ay, that’s the way. Dull not device by coldness and delay.  [_Exit._]
  ACT III  SCENE I. Cyprus. Before the Castle.
  ACT IV  SCENE I. Cyprus. Before the Castle.
Enter Othello and Iago.  IAGO. Will you think so?  OTHELLO. Think so, Iago?  IAGO. What, To kiss in private?  OTHELLO. An unauthoriz’d kiss.  IAGO. Or to be naked with her friend in bed An hour or more, not meaning any harm?  OTHELLO. Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm? It is hypocrisy against the devil: They that mean virtuously and yet do so, The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven.  IAGO. So they do nothing, ’tis a venial slip. But if I give my wife a handkerchief—  OTHELLO. What then?  IAGO. Why then, ’tis hers, my lord, and being hers, She may, I think, bestow’t on any man.  OTHELLO. She is protectress of her honour too. May she give that?  IAGO. Her honour is an essence that’s not seen; They have it very oft that have it not: But for the handkerchief—  OTHELLO. By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it. Thou said’st (O, it comes o’er my memory, As doth the raven o’er the infected house, Boding to all) he had my handkerchief.  IAGO. Ay, what of that?  OTHELLO. That’s not so good now.  IAGO. What If I had said I had seen him do you wrong? Or heard him say (as knaves be such abroad, Who having, by their own importunate suit, Or voluntary dotage of some mistress, Convinced or supplied them, cannot choose But they must blab.)  OTHELLO. Hath he said anything?  IAGO. He hath, my lord, but be you well assur’d, No more than he’ll unswear.  OTHELLO. What hath he said?  IAGO. Faith, that he did—I know not what he did.  OTHELLO. What? What?  IAGO. Lie.  OTHELLO. With her?  IAGO. With her, on her, what you will.  OTHELLO. Lie with her! lie on her!—We say lie on her when they belie her.—Lie with her! that’s fulsome. Handkerchief—confessions—handkerchief! To confess, and be hanged for his labour. First, to be hanged, and then to confess. I tremble at it. Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion without some instruction. It is not words that shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips. Is’t possible?—Confess?—handkerchief?—O devil!—  [_Falls in a trance._]  IAGO. Work on, My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught, And many worthy and chaste dames even thus, All guiltless, meet reproach. What, ho! my lord! My lord, I say! Othello!  Enter Cassio.  How now, Cassio!  CASSIO. What’s the matter?  IAGO. My lord is fallen into an epilepsy. This is his second fit. He had one yesterday.  CASSIO. Rub him about the temples.  IAGO. No, forbear; The lethargy must have his quiet course. If not, he foams at mouth, and by and by Breaks out to savage madness. Look, he stirs: Do you withdraw yourself a little while, He will recover straight. When he is gone, I would on great occasion speak with you.  [_Exit Cassio._]  How is it, general? Have you not hurt your head?  OTHELLO. Dost thou mock me?  IAGO. I mock you? No, by heaven. Would you would bear your fortune like a man!  OTHELLO. A horned man’s a monster and a beast.  IAGO. There’s many a beast, then, in a populous city, And many a civil monster.  OTHELLO. Did he confess it?  IAGO. Good sir, be a man. Think every bearded fellow that’s but yok’d May draw with you. There’s millions now alive That nightly lie in those unproper beds Which they dare swear peculiar: your case is better. O, ’tis the spite of hell, the fiend’s arch-mock, To lip a wanton in a secure couch, And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know, And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.  OTHELLO. O, thou art wise, ’tis certain.  IAGO. Stand you awhile apart, Confine yourself but in a patient list. Whilst you were here o’erwhelmed with your grief, (A passion most unsuiting such a man) Cassio came hither. I shifted him away, And laid good ’scuse upon your ecstasy, Bade him anon return, and here speak with me, The which he promis’d. Do but encave yourself, And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns, That dwell in every region of his face; For I will make him tell the tale anew, Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when He hath, and is again to cope your wife: I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience, Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen, And nothing of a man.  OTHELLO. Dost thou hear, Iago? I will be found most cunning in my patience; But,—dost thou hear?—most bloody.  IAGO. That’s not amiss. But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?  [_Othello withdraws._]  Now will I question Cassio of Bianca, A housewife that by selling her desires Buys herself bread and clothes: it is a creature That dotes on Cassio, (as ’tis the strumpet’s plague To beguile many and be beguil’d by one.) He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain From the excess of laughter. Here he comes.  Enter Cassio.  As he shall smile Othello shall go mad, And his unbookish jealousy must construe Poor Cassio’s smiles, gestures, and light behaviour Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?  CASSIO. The worser that you give me the addition Whose want even kills me.  IAGO. Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on’t. [_Speaking lower._] Now, if this suit lay in Bianca’s power, How quickly should you speed!  CASSIO. Alas, poor caitiff!  OTHELLO. [_Aside._] Look how he laughs already!  IAGO. I never knew a woman love man so.  CASSIO. Alas, poor rogue! I think, i’ faith, she loves me.  OTHELLO. [_Aside._] Now he denies it faintly and laughs it out.  IAGO. Do you hear, Cassio?  OTHELLO. Now he importunes him To tell it o’er. Go to, well said, well said.  IAGO. She gives it out that you shall marry her. Do you intend it?  CASSIO. Ha, ha, ha!  OTHELLO. Do you triumph, Roman? Do you triumph?  CASSIO. I marry her? What? A customer? I prithee, bear some charity to my wit, do not think it so unwholesome. Ha, ha, ha!  OTHELLO. So, so, so, so. They laugh that wins.  IAGO. Faith, the cry goes that you shall marry her.  CASSIO. Prithee say true.  IAGO. I am a very villain else.  OTHELLO. Have you scored me? Well.  CASSIO. This is the monkey’s own giving out. She is persuaded I will marry her, out of her own love and flattery, not out of my promise.  OTHELLO. Iago beckons me. Now he begins the story.  CASSIO. She was here even now. She haunts me in every place. I was the other day talking on the sea-bank with certain Venetians, and thither comes the bauble, and falls thus about my neck.  OTHELLO. Crying, “O dear Cassio!” as it were: his gesture imports it.  CASSIO. So hangs, and lolls, and weeps upon me; so hales and pulls me. Ha, ha, ha!  OTHELLO. Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O, I see that nose of yours, but not that dog I shall throw it to.  CASSIO. Well, I must leave her company.  IAGO. Before me! look where she comes.  Enter Bianca.  CASSIO. ’Tis such another fitchew! Marry, a perfum’d one. What do you mean by this haunting of me?  BIANCA. Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now? I was a fine fool to take it. I must take out the work? A likely piece of work, that you should find it in your chamber and not know who left it there! This is some minx’s token, and I must take out the work? There, give it your hobby-horse. Wheresoever you had it, I’ll take out no work on’t.  CASSIO. How now, my sweet Bianca? How now, how now?  OTHELLO. By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!  BIANCA. If you’ll come to supper tonight, you may. If you will not, come when you are next prepared for.  [_Exit._]  IAGO. After her, after her.  CASSIO. Faith, I must; she’ll rail in the street else.  IAGO. Will you sup there?  CASSIO. Faith, I intend so.  IAGO. Well, I may chance to see you, for I would very fain speak with you.  CASSIO. Prithee come, will you?  IAGO. Go to; say no more.  [_Exit Cassio._]  OTHELLO. [_Coming forward._] How shall I murder him, Iago?  IAGO. Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?  OTHELLO. O Iago!  IAGO. And did you see the handkerchief?  OTHELLO. Was that mine?  IAGO. Yours, by this hand: and to see how he prizes the foolish woman your wife! she gave it him, and he hath given it his whore.  OTHELLO. I would have him nine years a-killing. A fine woman, a fair woman, a sweet woman!  IAGO. Nay, you must forget that.  OTHELLO. Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned tonight, for she shall not live. No, my heart is turned to stone; I strike it, and it hurts my hand. O, the world hath not a sweeter creature. She might lie by an emperor’s side, and command him tasks.  IAGO. Nay, that’s not your way.  OTHELLO. Hang her, I do but say what she is. So delicate with her needle, an admirable musician! O, she will sing the savageness out of a bear! Of so high and plenteous wit and invention!  IAGO. She’s the worse for all this.  OTHELLO. O, a thousand, a thousand times: and then of so gentle a condition!  IAGO. Ay, too gentle.  OTHELLO. Nay, that’s certain. But yet the pity of it, Iago! O Iago, the pity of it, Iago!  IAGO. If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her patent to offend, for if it touch not you, it comes near nobody.  OTHELLO. I will chop her into messes. Cuckold me!  IAGO. O, ’tis foul in her.  OTHELLO. With mine officer!  IAGO. That’s fouler.  OTHELLO. Get me some poison, Iago; this night. I’ll not expostulate with her, lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again. This night, Iago.  IAGO. Do it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, even the bed she hath contaminated.  OTHELLO. Good, good. The justice of it pleases. Very good.  IAGO. And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker. You shall hear more by midnight.  OTHELLO. Excellent good. [_A trumpet within._] What trumpet is that same?  Enter Lodovico, Desdemona and Attendant.  IAGO. Something from Venice, sure. ’Tis Lodovico Come from the duke. See, your wife is with him.  LODOVICO. Save you, worthy general!  OTHELLO. With all my heart, sir.  LODOVICO. The duke and senators of Venice greet you.  [_Gives him a packet._]  OTHELLO. I kiss the instrument of their pleasures.  [_Opens the packet and reads._]  DESDEMONA. And what’s the news, good cousin Lodovico?  IAGO. I am very glad to see you, signior. Welcome to Cyprus.  LODOVICO. I thank you. How does Lieutenant Cassio?  IAGO. Lives, sir.  DESDEMONA. Cousin, there’s fall’n between him and my lord An unkind breach, but you shall make all well.  OTHELLO. Are you sure of that?  DESDEMONA. My lord?  OTHELLO. [_Reads._] “This fail you not to do, as you will—”  LODOVICO. He did not call; he’s busy in the paper. Is there division ’twixt my lord and Cassio?  DESDEMONA. A most unhappy one. I would do much To atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio.  OTHELLO. Fire and brimstone!  DESDEMONA. My lord?  OTHELLO. Are you wise?  DESDEMONA. What, is he angry?  LODOVICO. May be the letter mov’d him; For, as I think, they do command him home, Deputing Cassio in his government.  DESDEMONA. Trust me, I am glad on’t.  OTHELLO. Indeed!  DESDEMONA. My lord?  OTHELLO. I am glad to see you mad.  DESDEMONA. Why, sweet Othello?  OTHELLO. Devil!  [_Striking her._]  DESDEMONA. I have not deserv’d this.  LODOVICO. My lord, this would not be believ’d in Venice, Though I should swear I saw’t: ’tis very much. Make her amends. She weeps.  OTHELLO. O devil, devil! If that the earth could teem with woman’s tears, Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile. Out of my sight!  DESDEMONA. I will not stay to offend you.  [_Going._]  LODOVICO. Truly, an obedient lady. I do beseech your lordship, call her back.  OTHELLO. Mistress!  DESDEMONA. My lord?  OTHELLO. What would you with her, sir?  LODOVICO. Who, I, my lord?  OTHELLO. Ay, you did wish that I would make her turn. Sir, she can turn, and turn, and yet go on, And turn again. And she can weep, sir, weep; And she’s obedient, as you say, obedient, Very obedient. Proceed you in your tears. Concerning this, sir,—O well-painted passion! I am commanded home.—Get you away; I’ll send for you anon.—Sir, I obey the mandate, And will return to Venice.—Hence, avaunt!  [_Exit Desdemona._]  Cassio shall have my place. And, sir, tonight, I do entreat that we may sup together. You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus. Goats and monkeys!  [_Exit._]  LODOVICO. Is this the noble Moor, whom our full senate Call all in all sufficient? Is this the nature Whom passion could not shake? whose solid virtue The shot of accident nor dart of chance Could neither graze nor pierce?  IAGO. He is much chang’d.  LODOVICO. Are his wits safe? Is he not light of brain?  IAGO. He’s that he is. I may not breathe my censure What he might be. If what he might he is not, I would to heaven he were!  LODOVICO. What, strike his wife?  IAGO. Faith, that was not so well; yet would I knew That stroke would prove the worst!  LODOVICO. Is it his use? Or did the letters work upon his blood, And new-create this fault?  IAGO. Alas, alas! It is not honesty in me to speak What I have seen and known. You shall observe him, And his own courses will denote him so That I may save my speech: do but go after, And mark how he continues.  LODOVICO. I am sorry that I am deceiv’d in him.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. Cyprus. A Room in the Castle.  Enter Othello and Emilia.  OTHELLO. You have seen nothing, then?  EMILIA. Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.  OTHELLO. Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.  EMILIA. But then I saw no harm, and then I heard Each syllable that breath made up between them.  OTHELLO. What, did they never whisper?  EMILIA. Never, my lord.  OTHELLO. Nor send you out o’ the way?  EMILIA. Never.  OTHELLO. To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?  EMILIA. Never, my lord.  OTHELLO. That’s strange.  EMILIA. I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest, Lay down my soul at stake: if you think other, Remove your thought, it doth abuse your bosom. If any wretch have put this in your head, Let heaven requite it with the serpent’s curse, For if she be not honest, chaste, and true, There’s no man happy. The purest of their wives Is foul as slander.  OTHELLO. Bid her come hither. Go.  [_Exit Emilia._]  She says enough. Yet she’s a simple bawd That cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore, A closet lock and key of villainous secrets. And yet she’ll kneel and pray. I have seen her do ’t.  Enter Desdemona and Emilia.  DESDEMONA. My lord, what is your will?  OTHELLO. Pray, chuck, come hither.  DESDEMONA. What is your pleasure?  OTHELLO. Let me see your eyes. Look in my face.  DESDEMONA. What horrible fancy’s this?  OTHELLO. [_To Emilia._] Some of your function, mistress, Leave procreants alone, and shut the door. Cough, or cry hem, if anybody come. Your mystery, your mystery. Nay, dispatch.  [_Exit Emilia._]  DESDEMONA. Upon my knees, what doth your speech import? I understand a fury in your words, But not the words.  OTHELLO. Why, what art thou?  DESDEMONA. Your wife, my lord, your true and loyal wife.  OTHELLO. Come, swear it, damn thyself, Lest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves Should fear to seize thee. Therefore be double-damn’d. Swear thou art honest.  DESDEMONA. Heaven doth truly know it.  OTHELLO. Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.  DESDEMONA. To whom, my lord? With whom? How am I false?  OTHELLO. O Desdemona, away! away! away!  DESDEMONA. Alas the heavy day, why do you weep? Am I the motive of these tears, my lord? If haply you my father do suspect An instrument of this your calling back, Lay not your blame on me. If you have lost him, Why, I have lost him too.  OTHELLO. Had it pleas’d heaven To try me with affliction, had they rain’d All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head, Steep’d me in poverty to the very lips, Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes, I should have found in some place of my soul A drop of patience. But, alas, to make me A fixed figure for the time of scorn To point his slow unmoving finger at. Yet could I bear that too, well, very well: But there, where I have garner’d up my heart, Where either I must live or bear no life, The fountain from the which my current runs, Or else dries up, to be discarded thence, Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads To knot and gender in!—turn thy complexion there, Patience, thou young and rose-lipp’d cherubin, Ay, there, look grim as hell!  DESDEMONA. I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.  OTHELLO. O, ay, as summer flies are in the shambles, That quicken even with blowing. O thou weed, Who art so lovely fair, and smell’st so sweet, That the sense aches at thee, Would thou hadst ne’er been born!  DESDEMONA. Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?  OTHELLO. Was this fair paper, this most goodly book, Made to write “whore” upon? What committed? Committed! O thou public commoner! I should make very forges of my cheeks, That would to cinders burn up modesty, Did I but speak thy deeds. What committed! Heaven stops the nose at it, and the moon winks; The bawdy wind, that kisses all it meets, Is hush’d within the hollow mine of earth, And will not hear it. What committed! Impudent strumpet!  DESDEMONA. By heaven, you do me wrong.  OTHELLO. Are not you a strumpet?  DESDEMONA. No, as I am a Christian: If to preserve this vessel for my lord From any other foul unlawful touch Be not to be a strumpet, I am none.  OTHELLO. What, not a whore?  DESDEMONA. No, as I shall be sav’d.  OTHELLO. Is’t possible?  DESDEMONA. O, heaven forgive us!  OTHELLO. I cry you mercy then. I took you for that cunning whore of Venice That married with Othello.—You, mistress,  Enter Emilia.  That have the office opposite to Saint Peter, And keeps the gate of hell. You, you, ay, you! We have done our course; there’s money for your pains. I pray you turn the key, and keep our counsel.  [_Exit._]  EMILIA. Alas, what does this gentleman conceive? How do you, madam? How do you, my good lady?  DESDEMONA. Faith, half asleep.  EMILIA. Good madam, what’s the matter with my lord?  DESDEMONA. With who?  EMILIA. Why, with my lord, madam.  DESDEMONA. Who is thy lord?  EMILIA. He that is yours, sweet lady.  DESDEMONA. I have none. Do not talk to me, Emilia, I cannot weep, nor answer have I none But what should go by water. Prithee, tonight Lay on my bed my wedding sheets, remember, And call thy husband hither.  EMILIA. Here’s a change indeed!  [_Exit._]  DESDEMONA. ’Tis meet I should be us’d so, very meet. How have I been behav’d, that he might stick The small’st opinion on my least misuse?  Enter Iago and Emilia.  IAGO. What is your pleasure, madam? How is’t with you?  DESDEMONA. I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes Do it with gentle means and easy tasks. He might have chid me so, for, in good faith, I am a child to chiding.  IAGO. What’s the matter, lady?  EMILIA. Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhor’d her, Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her, As true hearts cannot bear.  DESDEMONA. Am I that name, Iago?  IAGO. What name, fair lady?  DESDEMONA. Such as she says my lord did say I was.  EMILIA. He call’d her whore: a beggar in his drink Could not have laid such terms upon his callet.  IAGO. Why did he so?  DESDEMONA. I do not know. I am sure I am none such.  IAGO. Do not weep, do not weep: alas the day!  EMILIA. Hath she forsook so many noble matches, Her father, and her country, and her friends, To be call’d whore? would it not make one weep?  DESDEMONA. It is my wretched fortune.  IAGO. Beshrew him for’t! How comes this trick upon him?  DESDEMONA. Nay, heaven doth know.  EMILIA. I will be hang’d, if some eternal villain, Some busy and insinuating rogue, Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office, Have not devis’d this slander. I’ll be hang’d else.  IAGO. Fie, there is no such man. It is impossible.  DESDEMONA. If any such there be, heaven pardon him!  EMILIA. A halter pardon him, and hell gnaw his bones! Why should he call her whore? who keeps her company? What place? what time? what form? what likelihood? The Moor’s abused by some most villainous knave, Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow. O heaven, that such companions thou’dst unfold, And put in every honest hand a whip To lash the rascals naked through the world Even from the east to the west!  IAGO. Speak within door.  EMILIA. O, fie upon them! Some such squire he was That turn’d your wit the seamy side without, And made you to suspect me with the Moor.  IAGO. You are a fool. Go to.  DESDEMONA. Alas, Iago, What shall I do to win my lord again? Good friend, go to him. For by this light of heaven, I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel. If e’er my will did trespass ’gainst his love, Either in discourse of thought or actual deed, Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense, Delighted them in any other form, Or that I do not yet, and ever did, And ever will, (though he do shake me off To beggarly divorcement) love him dearly, Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much; And his unkindness may defeat my life, But never taint my love. I cannot say “whore,” It does abhor me now I speak the word; To do the act that might the addition earn Not the world’s mass of vanity could make me.  IAGO. I pray you, be content. ’Tis but his humour. The business of the state does him offence, And he does chide with you.  DESDEMONA. If ’twere no other,—  IAGO. ’Tis but so, I warrant.  [_Trumpets within._]  Hark, how these instruments summon to supper. The messengers of Venice stay the meat. Go in, and weep not. All things shall be well.  [_Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia._]  Enter Roderigo.  How now, Roderigo?  RODERIGO. I do not find that thou dealest justly with me.  IAGO. What in the contrary?  RODERIGO. Every day thou daffest me with some device, Iago, and rather, as it seems to me now, keepest from me all conveniency than suppliest me with the least advantage of hope. I will indeed no longer endure it. Nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what already I have foolishly suffered.  IAGO. Will you hear me, Roderigo?  RODERIGO. Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and performances are no kin together.  IAGO. You charge me most unjustly.  RODERIGO. With naught but truth. I have wasted myself out of my means. The jewels you have had from me to deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a votarist: you have told me she hath received them, and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance, but I find none.  IAGO. Well, go to, very well.  RODERIGO. Very well, go to, I cannot go to, man, nor ’tis not very well. Nay, I say ’tis very scurvy, and begin to find myself fopped in it.  IAGO. Very well.  RODERIGO. I tell you ’tis not very well. I will make myself known to Desdemona. If she will return me my jewels, I will give over my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation. If not, assure yourself I will seek satisfaction of you.  IAGO. You have said now.  RODERIGO. Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing.  IAGO. Why, now I see there’s mettle in thee, and even from this instant do build on thee a better opinion than ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo. Thou hast taken against me a most just exception, but yet I protest, I have dealt most directly in thy affair.  RODERIGO. It hath not appeared.  IAGO. I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your suspicion is not without wit and judgement. But, Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I have greater reason to believe now than ever,—I mean purpose, courage, and valour,—this night show it. If thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona, take me from this world with treachery and devise engines for my life.  RODERIGO. Well, what is it? Is it within reason and compass?  IAGO. Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice to depute Cassio in Othello’s place.  RODERIGO. Is that true? Why then Othello and Desdemona return again to Venice.  IAGO. O, no; he goes into Mauritania, and takes away with him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be lingered here by some accident: wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of Cassio.  RODERIGO. How do you mean “removing” of him?  IAGO. Why, by making him uncapable of Othello’s place: knocking out his brains.  RODERIGO. And that you would have me to do?  IAGO. Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right. He sups tonight with a harlotry, and thither will I go to him. He knows not yet of his honourable fortune. If you will watch his going thence, which I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one, you may take him at your pleasure: I will be near to second your attempt, and he shall fall between us. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with me. I will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him. It is now high supper-time, and the night grows to waste. About it.  RODERIGO. I will hear further reason for this.  IAGO. And you shall be satisfied.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. Cyprus. Another Room in the Castle.  Enter Othello, Lodovico, Desdemona, Emilia and Attendants.  LODOVICO. I do beseech you, sir, trouble yourself no further.  OTHELLO. O, pardon me; ’twill do me good to walk.  LODOVICO. Madam, good night. I humbly thank your ladyship.  DESDEMONA. Your honour is most welcome.  OTHELLO. Will you walk, sir?— O, Desdemona,—  DESDEMONA. My lord?  OTHELLO. Get you to bed on th’ instant, I will be return’d forthwith. Dismiss your attendant there. Look ’t be done.  DESDEMONA. I will, my lord.  [_Exeunt Othello, Lodovico and Attendants._]  EMILIA. How goes it now? He looks gentler than he did.  DESDEMONA. He says he will return incontinent, He hath commanded me to go to bed, And bade me to dismiss you.  EMILIA. Dismiss me?  DESDEMONA. It was his bidding. Therefore, good Emilia, Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu. We must not now displease him.  EMILIA. I would you had never seen him!  DESDEMONA. So would not I. My love doth so approve him, That even his stubbornness, his checks, his frowns,— Prithee, unpin me,—have grace and favour in them.  EMILIA. I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.  DESDEMONA. All’s one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds! If I do die before thee, prithee, shroud me In one of those same sheets.  EMILIA. Come, come, you talk.  DESDEMONA. My mother had a maid call’d Barbary, She was in love, and he she lov’d prov’d mad And did forsake her. She had a song of “willow”, An old thing ’twas, but it express’d her fortune, And she died singing it. That song tonight Will not go from my mind. I have much to do But to go hang my head all at one side And sing it like poor Barbary. Prithee dispatch.  EMILIA. Shall I go fetch your night-gown?  DESDEMONA. No, unpin me here. This Lodovico is a proper man.  EMILIA. A very handsome man.  DESDEMONA. He speaks well.  EMILIA. I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.  DESDEMONA. [_Singing._]     _The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree,         Sing all a green willow.     Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee,         Sing willow, willow, willow.     The fresh streams ran by her, and murmur’d her moans,         Sing willow, willow, willow;     Her salt tears fell from her, and soften’d the stones;—_  Lay by these:—  [_Sings._]         _Sing willow, willow, willow._  Prithee hie thee. He’ll come anon.  [_Sings._]     _Sing all a green willow must be my garland. Let nobody blame him, his scorn I approve,—_  Nay, that’s not next. Hark! who is’t that knocks?  EMILIA. It’s the wind.  DESDEMONA. [_Sings._]     _I call’d my love false love; but what said he then?         Sing willow, willow, willow:     If I court mo women, you’ll couch with mo men._  So get thee gone; good night. Mine eyes do itch; Doth that bode weeping?  EMILIA. ’Tis neither here nor there.  DESDEMONA. I have heard it said so. O, these men, these men! Dost thou in conscience think,—tell me, Emilia,— That there be women do abuse their husbands In such gross kind?  EMILIA. There be some such, no question.  DESDEMONA. Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?  EMILIA. Why, would not you?  DESDEMONA. No, by this heavenly light!  EMILIA. Nor I neither by this heavenly light, I might do’t as well i’ the dark.  DESDEMONA. Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?  EMILIA. The world’s a huge thing. It is a great price For a small vice.  DESDEMONA. In troth, I think thou wouldst not.  EMILIA. In troth, I think I should, and undo’t when I had done. Marry, I would not do such a thing for a joint-ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty exhibition; but, for the whole world—why, who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch? I should venture purgatory for ’t.  DESDEMONA. Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong for the whole world.  EMILIA. Why, the wrong is but a wrong i’ the world; and having the world for your labour, ’tis a wrong in your own world, and you might quickly make it right.  DESDEMONA. I do not think there is any such woman.  EMILIA. Yes, a dozen; and as many to the vantage as would store the world they played for. But I do think it is their husbands’ faults If wives do fall: say that they slack their duties, And pour our treasures into foreign laps; Or else break out in peevish jealousies, Throwing restraint upon us. Or say they strike us, Or scant our former having in despite. Why, we have galls; and though we have some grace, Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know Their wives have sense like them: they see, and smell And have their palates both for sweet and sour, As husbands have. What is it that they do When they change us for others? Is it sport? I think it is. And doth affection breed it? I think it doth. Is’t frailty that thus errs? It is so too. And have not we affections, Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have? Then let them use us well: else let them know, The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.  DESDEMONA. Good night, good night. Heaven me such usage send, Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend!  [_Exeunt._]

  ACT I
 Enter Gower.   Before the palace of Antioch.  To sing a song that old was sung, From ashes ancient Gower is come; Assuming man’s infirmities, To glad your ear, and please your eyes. It hath been sung at festivals, On ember-eves and holy-ales; And lords and ladies in their lives Have read it for restoratives: The purchase is to make men glorious, _Et bonum quo antiquius eo melius._ If you, born in these latter times, When wit’s more ripe, accept my rhymes, And that to hear an old man sing May to your wishes pleasure bring, I life would wish, and that I might Waste it for you, like taper-light. This Antioch, then, Antiochus the Great Built up, this city, for his chiefest seat; The fairest in all Syria. I tell you what mine authors say: This king unto him took a fere, Who died and left a female heir, So buxom, blithe, and full of face, As heaven had lent her all his grace; With whom the father liking took, And her to incest did provoke. Bad child; worse father! to entice his own To evil should be done by none: But custom what they did begin Was with long use account’d no sin. The beauty of this sinful dame Made many princes thither frame, To seek her as a bedfellow, In marriage pleasures playfellow: Which to prevent he made a law, To keep her still, and men in awe, That whoso ask’d her for his wife, His riddle told not, lost his life: So for her many a wight did die, As yon grim looks do testify. What now ensues, to the judgement your eye I give, my cause who best can justify.   [_Exit._]
 SCENE III. Tyre. An ante-chamber in the Palace.   Enter Thaliard.  THALIARD. So, this is Tyre, and this the court. Here must I kill King Pericles; and if I do it not, I am sure to be hanged at home: ’tis dangerous. Well, I perceive he was a wise fellow, and had good discretion, that, being bid to ask what he would of the king, desired he might know none of his secrets: now do I see he had some reason for’t; for if a king bid a man be a villain, he’s bound by the indenture of his oath to be one. Husht, here come the lords of Tyre.   Enter Helicanus and Escanes with other Lords of Tyre.  HELICANUS. You shall not need, my fellow peers of Tyre, Further to question me of your king’s departure: His seal’d commission, left in trust with me, Doth speak sufficiently he’s gone to travel.  THALIARD. [_Aside._] How? the king gone?  HELICANUS. If further yet you will be satisfied, Why, as it were unlicensed of your loves, He would depart, I’ll give some light unto you. Being at Antioch—  THALIARD. [_Aside._] What from Antioch?  HELICANUS. Royal Antiochus—on what cause I know not Took some displeasure at him; at least he judged so: And doubting lest that he had err’d or sinn’d, To show his sorrow, he’d correct himself; So puts himself unto the shipman’s toil, With whom each minute threatens life or death.  THALIARD. [_Aside._] Well, I perceive I shall not be hang’d now, although I would; But since he’s gone, the king’s seas must please He ’scaped the land, to perish at the sea. I’ll present myself. Peace to the lords of Tyre!  HELICANUS. Lord Thaliard from Antiochus is welcome.  THALIARD. From him I come With message unto princely Pericles; But since my landing I have understood Your lord has betook himself to unknown travels, My message must return from whence it came.  HELICANUS. We have no reason to desire it, Commended to our master, not to us: Yet, ere you shall depart, this we desire, As friends to Antioch, we may feast in Tyre.   [_Exeunt._]
 SCENE IV. Tarsus. A room in the Governor’s house.   Enter Cleon, the governor of Tarsus, with Dionyza and others.  CLEON. My Dionyza, shall we rest us here, And by relating tales of others’ griefs, See if ’twill teach us to forget our own?  DIONYZA. That were to blow at fire in hope to quench it; For who digs hills because they do aspire Throws down one mountain to cast up a higher. O my distressed lord, even such our griefs are; Here they’re but felt, and seen with mischief’s eyes, But like to groves, being topp’d, they higher rise.  CLEON. O Dionyza, Who wanteth food, and will not say he wants it, Or can conceal his hunger till he famish? Our tongues and sorrows do sound deep Our woes into the air; our eyes do weep, Till tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them louder; That, if heaven slumber while their creatures want, They may awake their helps to comfort them. I’ll then discourse our woes, felt several years, And wanting breath to speak, help me with tears.  DIONYZA. I’ll do my best, sir.  CLEON. This Tarsus, o’er which I have the government, A city on whom plenty held full hand, For riches strew’d herself even in the streets; Whose towers bore heads so high they kiss’d the clouds, And strangers ne’er beheld but wonder’d at; Whose men and dames so jetted and adorn’d, Like one another’s glass to trim them by: Their tables were stored full to glad the sight, And not so much to feed on as delight; All poverty was scorn’d, and pride so great, The name of help grew odious to repeat.  DIONYZA. O, ’tis too true.  CLEON. But see what heaven can do! By this our change, These mouths, who but of late, earth, sea, and air, Were all too little to content and please, Although they gave their creatures in abundance, As houses are defiled for want of use, They are now starved for want of exercise: Those palates who, not yet two summers younger, Must have inventions to delight the taste, Would now be glad of bread and beg for it: Those mothers who, to nousle up their babes, Thought nought too curious, are ready now To eat those little darlings whom they loved. So sharp are hunger’s teeth, that man and wife Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life: Here stands a lord, and there a lady weeping; Here many sink, yet those which see them fall Have scarce strength left to give them burial. Is not this true?  DIONYZA. Our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it.  CLEON. O, let those cities that of plenty’s cup And her prosperities so largely taste, With their superflous riots, hear these tears! The misery of Tarsus may be theirs.   Enter a Lord.  LORD. Where’s the lord governor?  CLEON. Here. Speak out thy sorrows which thou bring’st in haste, For comfort is too far for us to expect.  LORD. We have descried, upon our neighbouring shore, A portly sail of ships make hitherward.  CLEON. I thought as much. One sorrow never comes but brings an heir, That may succeed as his inheritor; And so in ours: some neighbouring nation, Taking advantage of our misery, That stuff’d the hollow vessels with their power, To beat us down, the which are down already; And make a conquest of unhappy me, Whereas no glory’s got to overcome.  LORD. That’s the least fear; for, by the semblance Of their white flags display’d, they bring us peace, And come to us as favourers, not as foes.  CLEON. Thou speak’st like him’s untutor’d to repeat: Who makes the fairest show means most deceit. But bring they what they will and what they can, What need we fear? The ground’s the lowest, and we are half way there. Go tell their general we attend him here, To know for what he comes, and whence he comes, And what he craves.  LORD. I go, my lord.   [_Exit._]  CLEON. Welcome is peace, if he on peace consist; If wars, we are unable to resist.   Enter Pericles with Attendants.  PERICLES. Lord governor, for so we hear you are, Let not our ships and number of our men Be like a beacon fired to amaze your eyes. We have heard your miseries as far as Tyre, And seen the desolation of your streets: Nor come we to add sorrow to your tears, But to relieve them of their heavy load; And these our ships, you happily may think Are like the Trojan horse was stuff’d within With bloody veins, expecting overthrow, Are stored with corn to make your needy bread, And give them life whom hunger starved half dead.  ALL. The gods of Greece protect you! And we’ll pray for you.  PERICLES. Arise, I pray you, rise: We do not look for reverence, but for love, And harbourage for ourself, our ships and men.  CLEON. The which when any shall not gratify, Or pay you with unthankfulness in thought, Be it our wives, our children, or ourselves, The curse of heaven and men succeed their evils! Till when,—the which I hope shall ne’er be seen,— Your grace is welcome to our town and us.  PERICLES. Which welcome we’ll accept; feast here awhile, Until our stars that frown lend us a smile.   [_Exeunt._]
  ACT II
 Enter Gower.  GOWER. Here have you seen a mighty king His child, iwis, to incest bring; A better prince and benign lord, That will prove awful both in deed and word. Be quiet then as men should be, Till he hath pass’d necessity. I’ll show you those in troubles reign, Losing a mite, a mountain gain. The good in conversation, To whom I give my benison, Is still at Tarsus, where each man Thinks all is writ he speken can; And to remember what he does, Build his statue to make him glorious: But tidings to the contrary Are brought your eyes; what need speak I?   Dumb-show. Enter at one door Pericles talking with Cleon; all the  train with them. Enter at another door a Gentleman with a letter to  Pericles; Pericles shows the letter to Cleon; gives the Messenger a  reward, and knights him. Exit Pericles at one door, and Cleon at  another.  Good Helicane, that stay’d at home. Not to eat honey like a drone From others’ labours; for though he strive To killen bad, keep good alive; And to fulfil his prince’ desire, Sends word of all that haps in Tyre: How Thaliard came full bent with sin And had intent to murder him; And that in Tarsus was not best Longer for him to make his rest. He, doing so, put forth to seas, Where when men been, there’s seldom ease; For now the wind begins to blow; Thunder above and deeps below Make such unquiet, that the ship Should house him safe is wreck’d and split; And he, good prince, having all lost, By waves from coast to coast is tost: All perishen of man, of pelf, Ne aught escapen but himself; Till Fortune, tired with doing bad, Threw him ashore, to give him glad: And here he comes. What shall be next, Pardon old Gower,—this longs the text.   [_Exit._]
 SCENE I. Pentapolis. An open place by the seaside.   Enter Pericles, wet.  PERICLES. Yet cease your ire, you angry stars of heaven! Wind, rain, and thunder, remember earthly man Is but a substance that must yield to you; And I, as fits my nature, do obey you: Alas, the sea hath cast me on the rocks, Wash’d me from shore to shore, and left me breath Nothing to think on but ensuing death: Let it suffice the greatness of your powers To have bereft a prince of all his fortunes; And having thrown him from your watery grave, Here to have death in peace is all he’ll crave.   Enter three Fishermen.  FIRST FISHERMAN. What, ho, Pilch!  SECOND FISHERMAN. Ha, come and bring away the nets!  FIRST FISHERMAN. What, Patch-breech, I say!  THIRD FISHERMAN. What say you, master?  FIRST FISHERMAN. Look how thou stirrest now! Come away, or I’ll fetch thee with a wanion.  THIRD FISHERMAN. Faith, master, I am thinking of the poor men that were cast away before us even now.  FIRST FISHERMAN. Alas, poor souls, it grieved my heart to hear what pitiful cries they made to us to help them, when, well-a-day, we could scarce help ourselves.  THIRD FISHERMAN. Nay, master, said not I as much when I saw the porpus how he bounced and tumbled? They say they’re half fish, half flesh: a plague on them, they ne’er come but I look to be washed. Master, I marvel how the fishes live in the sea.  FIRST FISHERMAN. Why, as men do a-land; the great ones eat up the little ones: I can compare our rich misers to nothing so fitly as to a whale; a’ plays and tumbles, driving the poor fry before him, and at last devours them all at a mouthful. Such whales have I heard on o’ the land, who never leave gaping till they swallowed the whole parish, church, steeple, bells and all.  PERICLES. [_Aside._] A pretty moral.  THIRD FISHERMAN. But, master, if I had been the sexton, I would have been that day in the belfry.  SECOND FISHERMAN. Why, man?  THIRD FISHERMAN. Because he should have swallowed me too; and when I had been in his belly, I would have kept such a jangling of the bells, that he should never have left, till he cast bells, steeple, church and parish up again. But if the good King Simonides were of my mind,—  PERICLES. [_Aside._] Simonides?  THIRD FISHERMAN. We would purge the land of these drones, that rob the bee of her honey.  PERICLES. [_Aside._] How from the finny subject of the sea These fishers tell the infirmities of men; And from their watery empire recollect All that may men approve or men detect! Peace be at your labour, honest fishermen.  SECOND FISHERMAN. Honest! good fellow, what’s that? If it be a day fits you, search out of the calendar, and nobody look after it.  PERICLES. May see the sea hath cast upon your coast.  SECOND FISHERMAN. What a drunken knave was the sea to cast thee in our way!  PERICLES. A man whom both the waters and the wind, In that vast tennis-court, have made the ball For them to play upon, entreats you pity him; He asks of you, that never used to beg.  FIRST FISHERMAN. No, friend, cannot you beg? Here’s them in our country of Greece gets more with begging than we can do with working.  SECOND FISHERMAN. Canst thou catch any fishes, then?  PERICLES. I never practised it.  SECOND FISHERMAN. Nay, then thou wilt starve, sure; for here’s nothing to be got now-a-days, unless thou canst fish for’t.  PERICLES. What I have been I have forgot to know; But what I am, want teaches me to think on: A man throng’d up with cold: my veins are chill, And have no more of life than may suffice To give my tongue that heat to ask your help; Which if you shall refuse, when I am dead, For that I am a man, pray see me buried.  FIRST FISHERMAN. Die quoth-a? Now gods forbid’t, and I have a gown here; come, put it on; keep thee warm. Now, afore me, a handsome fellow! Come, thou shalt go home, and we’ll have flesh for holidays, fish for fasting-days, and moreo’er puddings and flap-jacks, and thou shalt be welcome.  PERICLES. I thank you, sir.  SECOND FISHERMAN. Hark you, my friend; you said you could not beg?  PERICLES. I did but crave.  SECOND FISHERMAN. But crave! Then I’ll turn craver too, and so I shall ’scape whipping.  PERICLES. Why, are your beggars whipped, then?  SECOND FISHERMAN. O, not all, my friend, not all; for if all your beggars were whipped, I would wish no better office than to be beadle. But, master, I’ll go draw up the net.   [_Exit with Third Fisherman._]  PERICLES. [_Aside._] How well this honest mirth becomes their labour!  FIRST FISHERMAN. Hark you, sir, do you know where ye are?  PERICLES. Not well.  FIRST FISHERMAN. Why, I’ll tell you: this is called Pentapolis, and our King, the good Simonides.  PERICLES. The good Simonides, do you call him?  FIRST FISHERMAN. Ay, sir; and he deserves so to be called for his peaceable reign and good government.  PERICLES. He is a happy king, since he gains from his subjects the name of good government. How far is his court distant from this shore?  FIRST FISHERMAN. Marry sir, half a day’s journey: and I’ll tell you, he hath a fair daughter, and tomorrow is her birth-day; and there are princes and knights come from all parts of the world to joust and tourney for her love.  PERICLES. Were my fortunes equal to my desires, I could wish to make one there.  FIRST FISHERMAN. O, sir, things must be as they may; and what a man cannot get, he may lawfully deal for—his wife’s soul.   Re-enter Second and Third Fishermen, drawing up a net.  SECOND FISHERMAN. Help, master, help! here’s a fish hangs in the net, like a poor man’s right in the law; ’twill hardly come out. Ha! bots on’t, ’tis come at last, and ’tis turned to a rusty armour.  PERICLES. An armour, friends! I pray you, let me see it. Thanks, Fortune, yet, that, after all my crosses, Thou givest me somewhat to repair myself, And though it was mine own, part of my heritage, Which my dead father did bequeath to me, With this strict charge, even as he left his life. ‘Keep it, my Pericles; it hath been a shield ’Twixt me and death;’—and pointed to this brace;— ‘For that it saved me, keep it; in like necessity— The which the gods protect thee from!—may defend thee.’ It kept where I kept, I so dearly loved it; Till the rough seas, that spares not any man, Took it in rage, though calm’d have given’t again: I thank thee for’t: my shipwreck now’s no ill, Since I have here my father gave in his will.  FIRST FISHERMAN. What mean you sir?  PERICLES. To beg of you, kind friends, this coat of worth, For it was sometime target to a king; I know it by this mark. He loved me dearly, And for his sake I wish the having of it; And that you’d guide me to your sovereign court, Where with it I may appear a gentleman; And if that ever my low fortune’s better, I’ll pay your bounties; till then rest your debtor.  FIRST FISHERMAN. Why, wilt thou tourney for the lady?  PERICLES. I’ll show the virtue I have borne in arms.  FIRST FISHERMAN. Why, d’ye take it, and the gods give thee good on’t!  SECOND FISHERMAN. Ay, but hark you, my friend; ’twas we that made up this garment through the rough seams of the waters: there are certain condolements, certain vails. I hope, sir, if you thrive, you’ll remember from whence you had them.  PERICLES. Believe’t I will. By your furtherance I am clothed in steel; And spite of all the rapture of the sea, This jewel holds his building on my arm: Unto thy value I will mount myself Upon a courser, whose delightful steps Shall make the gazer joy to see him tread. Only, my friend, I yet am unprovided Of a pair of bases.  SECOND FISHERMAN. We’ll sure provide: thou shalt have my best gown to make thee a pair; and I’ll bring thee to the court myself.  PERICLES. Then honour be but a goal to my will, This day I’ll rise, or else add ill to ill.   [_Exeunt._]
 SCENE II. The same. A public way, or platform leading to the lists. A pavilion by the side of it for the reception of the King, Princess, Lords, etc.   Enter Simonides, Thaisa, Lords and Attendants.  SIMONIDES. Are the knights ready to begin the triumph?  FIRST LORD. They are, my liege; And stay your coming to present themselves.  SIMONIDES. Return them, we are ready; and our daughter, In honour of whose birth these triumphs are, Sits here, like beauty’s child, whom Nature gat For men to see, and seeing wonder at.   [_Exit a Lord._]  THAISA. It pleaseth you, my royal father, to express My commendations great, whose merit’s less.  SIMONIDES. It’s fit it should be so; for princes are A model, which heaven makes like to itself: As jewels lose their glory if neglected, So princes their renowns if not respected. ’Tis now your honour, daughter, to entertain The labour of each knight in his device.  THAISA. Which, to preserve mine honour, I’ll perform.   The first Knight passes by, and his Squire presents his shield to  Thaisa.  SIMONIDES. Who is the first that doth prefer himself?  THAISA. A knight of Sparta, my renowned father; And the device he bears upon his shield Is a black Ethiope reaching at the sun: The word, _Lux tua vita mihi._  SIMONIDES. He loves you well that holds his life of you.   The second Knight passes by, and his Squire presents his shield to  Thaisa.  Who is the second that presents himself?  THAISA. A prince of Macedon, my royal father; And the device he bears upon his shield Is an arm’d knight that’s conquer’d by a lady; The motto thus, in Spanish, _Piu por dulzura que por forza._   The third Knight passes by, and his Squire presents his shield to  Thaisa.  SIMONIDES. And what’s the third?  THAISA. The third of Antioch; And his device, a wreath of chivalry; The word, _Me pompae provexit apex._   The fourth Knight passes by, and his Squire presents his shield to  Thaisa.  SIMONIDES. What is the fourth?  THAISA. A burning torch that’s turned upside down; The word, _Quod me alit me extinguit._  SIMONIDES. Which shows that beauty hath his power and will, Which can as well inflame as it can kill.   The fifth Knight passes by, and his Squire presents his shield to  Thaisa.  THAISA. The fifth, an hand environed with clouds, Holding out gold that’s by the touchstone tried; The motto thus, _Sic spectanda fides._   The sixth Knight, Pericles, passes in rusty armour with bases, and  unaccompanied. He presents his device directly to Thaisa.  SIMONIDES. And what’s the sixth and last, the which the knight himself With such a graceful courtesy deliver’d?  THAISA. He seems to be a stranger; but his present is A wither’d branch, that’s only green at top; The motto, _In hac spe vivo._  SIMONIDES. A pretty moral; From the dejected state wherein he is, He hopes by you his fortunes yet may flourish.  FIRST LORD. He had need mean better than his outward show Can any way speak in his just commend; For by his rusty outside he appears To have practised more the whipstock than the lance.  SECOND LORD. He well may be a stranger, for he comes To an honour’d triumph strangely furnished.  THIRD LORD. And on set purpose let his armour rust Until this day, to scour it in the dust.  SIMONIDES. Opinion’s but a fool, that makes us scan The outward habit by the inward man. But stay, the knights are coming. We will withdraw into the gallery.   [_Exeunt. Great shouts within, and all cry_ ‘The mean Knight!’]
 SCENE III. The same. A hall of state: a banquet prepared.   Enter Simonides, Thaisa, Lords, Attendants and Knights, from tilting.  SIMONIDES. Knights, To say you’re welcome were superfluous. To place upon the volume of your deeds, As in a title-page, your worth in arms, Were more than you expect, or more than’s fit, Since every worth in show commends itself. Prepare for mirth, for mirth becomes a feast: You are princes and my guests.  THAISA. But you, my knight and guest; To whom this wreath of victory I give, And crown you king of this day’s happiness.  PERICLES. ’Tis more by fortune, lady, than by merit.  SIMONIDES. Call it by what you will, the day is yours; And here, I hope, is none that envies it. In framing an artist, art hath thus decreed, To make some good, but others to exceed; And you are her labour’d scholar. Come queen of the feast,— For, daughter, so you are,—here take your place: Marshal the rest, as they deserve their grace.  KNIGHTS. We are honour’d much by good Simonides.  SIMONIDES. Your presence glads our days; honour we love; For who hates honour hates the gods above.  MARSHALL. Sir, yonder is your place.  PERICLES. Some other is more fit.  FIRST KNIGHT. Contend not, sir; for we are gentlemen Have neither in our hearts nor outward eyes Envied the great, nor shall the low despise.  PERICLES. You are right courteous knights.  SIMONIDES. Sit, sir, sit. By Jove, I wonder, that is king of thoughts, These cates resist me, he but thought upon.  THAISA. By Juno, that is queen of marriage, All viands that I eat do seem unsavoury, Wishing him my meat. Sure, he’s a gallant gentleman.  SIMONIDES. He’s but a country gentleman; Has done no more than other knights have done; Has broken a staff or so; so let it pass.  THAISA. To me he seems like diamond to glass.  PERICLES. Yon king’s to me like to my father’s picture, Which tells me in that glory once he was; Had princes sit, like stars, about his throne, And he the sun, for them to reverence; None that beheld him, but, like lesser lights, Did vail their crowns to his supremacy: Where now his son’s like a glow-worm in the night, The which hath fire in darkness, none in light: Whereby I see that time’s the king of men, He’s both their parent, and he is their grave, And gives them what he will, not what they crave.  SIMONIDES. What, are you merry, knights?  KNIGHTS. Who can be other in this royal presence?  SIMONIDES. Here, with a cup that’s stored unto the brim,— As you do love, fill to your mistress’ lips,— We drink this health to you.  KNIGHTS. We thank your grace.  SIMONIDES. Yet pause awhile. Yon knight doth sit too melancholy, As if the entertainment in our court Had not a show might countervail his worth. Note it not you, Thaisa?  THAISA. What is’t to me, my father?  SIMONIDES. O attend, my daughter: Princes in this should live like gods above, Who freely give to everyone that comes to honour them: And princes not doing so are like to gnats, Which make a sound, but kill’d are wonder’d at. Therefore to make his entrance more sweet, Here, say we drink this standing-bowl of wine to him.  THAISA. Alas, my father, it befits not me Unto a stranger knight to be so bold: He may my proffer take for an offence, Since men take women’s gifts for impudence.  SIMONIDES. How? Do as I bid you, or you’ll move me else.  THAISA. [_Aside._] Now, by the gods, he could not please me better.  SIMONIDES. And furthermore tell him, we desire to know of him, Of whence he is, his name and parentage.  THAISA. The king my father, sir, has drunk to you.  PERICLES. I thank him.  THAISA. Wishing it so much blood unto your life.  PERICLES. I thank both him and you, and pledge him freely.  THAISA. And further he desires to know of you, Of whence you are, your name and parentage.  PERICLES. A gentleman of Tyre; my name, Pericles; My education been in arts and arms; Who, looking for adventures in the world, Was by the rough seas reft of ships and men, And after shipwreck driven upon this shore.  THAISA. He thanks your grace; names himself Pericles, A gentleman of Tyre, Who only by misfortune of the seas Bereft of ships and men, cast on this shore.  SIMONIDES. Now, by the gods, I pity his misfortune, And will awake him from his melancholy. Come, gentlemen, we sit too long on trifles, And waste the time, which looks for other revels. Even in your armours, as you are address’d, Will well become a soldier’s dance. I will not have excuse, with saying this, ‘Loud music is too harsh for ladies’ heads’ Since they love men in arms as well as beds.   [_The Knights dance._]  So, this was well ask’d, ’twas so well perform’d. Come, sir; here is a lady which wants breathing too: And I have heard you knights of Tyre Are excellent in making ladies trip; And that their measures are as excellent.  PERICLES. In those that practise them they are, my lord.  SIMONIDES. O, that’s as much as you would be denied Of your fair courtesy.   [_The Knights and Ladies dance._]  Unclasp, unclasp: Thanks gentlemen, to all; all have done well. [_To Pericles._] But you the best. Pages and lights to conduct These knights unto their several lodgings. [_To Pericles._] Yours, sir, we have given order to be next our own.  PERICLES. I am at your grace’s pleasure.  SIMONIDES. Princes, it is too late to talk of love; And that’s the mark I know you level at: Therefore each one betake him to his rest; Tomorrow all for speeding do their best.   [_Exeunt._]
 SCENE IV. Tyre. A room in the Governor’s house.   Enter Helicanus and Escanes.  HELICANUS. No, Escanes, know this of me, Antiochus from incest lived not free: For which the most high gods not minding longer To withhold the vengeance that they had in store Due to this heinous capital offence, Even in the height and pride of all his glory, When he was seated in a chariot Of an inestimable value, and his daughter with him, A fire from heaven came and shrivell’d up Their bodies, even to loathing, for they so stunk, That all those eyes adored them ere their fall Scorn now their hand should give them burial.  ESCANES. ’Twas very strange  HELICANUS. And yet but justice; for though this king were great; His greatness was no guard to bar heaven’s shaft, But sin had his reward.  ESCANES. ’Tis very true.   Enter two or three Lords.  FIRST LORD. See, not a man in private conference Or council has respect with him but he.  SECOND LORD. It shall no longer grieve without reproof.  THIRD LORD. And cursed be he that will not second it.  FIRST LORD. Follow me, then. Lord Helicane, a word.  HELICANUS. With me? and welcome: happy day, my lords.  FIRST LORD. Know that our griefs are risen to the top, And now at length they overflow their banks.  HELICANUS. Your griefs! for what? Wrong not your prince you love.  FIRST LORD. Wrong not yourself, then, noble Helicane; But if the prince do live, let us salute him. Or know what ground’s made happy by his breath. If in the world he live, we’ll seek him out; If in his grave he rest, we’ll find him there. We’ll be resolved he lives to govern us, Or dead, give’s cause to mourn his funeral, And leave us to our free election.  SECOND LORD. Whose death’s indeed the strongest in our censure: And knowing this kingdom is without a head,— Like goodly buildings left without a roof Soon fall to ruin,—your noble self, That best know how to rule and how to reign, We thus submit unto,—our sovereign.  ALL. Live, noble Helicane!  HELICANUS. For honour’s cause, forbear your suffrages: If that you love Prince Pericles, forbear. Take I your wish, I leap into the seas, Where’s hourly trouble for a minute’s ease. A twelvemonth longer, let me entreat you To forbear the absence of your king; If in which time expired, he not return, I shall with aged patience bear your yoke. But if I cannot win you to this love, Go search like nobles, like noble subjects, And in your search spend your adventurous worth; Whom if you find, and win unto return, You shall like diamonds sit about his crown.  FIRST LORD. To wisdom he’s a fool that will not yield; And since Lord Helicane enjoineth us, We with our travels will endeavour us.  HELICANUS. Then you love us, we you, and we’ll clasp hands: When peers thus knit, a kingdom ever stands.   [_Exeunt._]
 SCENE V. Pentapolis. A room in the palace.   Enter Simonides reading a letter at one door; the Knights meet him.  FIRST KNIGHT. Good morrow to the good Simonides.  SIMONIDES. Knights, from my daughter this I let you know, That for this twelvemonth she’ll not undertake A married life. Her reason to herself is only known, Which yet from her by no means can I get.  SECOND KNIGHT. May we not get access to her, my lord?  SIMONIDES. Faith, by no means; she hath so strictly tied Her to her chamber, that ’tis impossible. One twelve moons more she’ll wear Diana’s livery; This by the eye of Cynthia hath she vow’d, And on her virgin honour will not break it.  THIRD KNIGHT. Loath to bid farewell, we take our leaves.   [_Exeunt Knights._]  SIMONIDES. So, they are well dispatch’d; now to my daughter’s letter: She tells me here, she’ll wed the stranger knight, Or never more to view nor day nor light. ’Tis well, mistress; your choice agrees with mine; I like that well: nay, how absolute she’s in’t, Not minding whether I dislike or no! Well, I do commend her choice; And will no longer have it be delay’d. Soft! here he comes: I must dissemble it.   Enter Pericles.  PERICLES. All fortune to the good Simonides!  SIMONIDES. To you as much. Sir, I am beholding to you For your sweet music this last night: I do Protest my ears were never better fed With such delightful pleasing harmony.  PERICLES. It is your grace’s pleasure to commend; Not my desert.  SIMONIDES. Sir, you are music’s master.  PERICLES. The worst of all her scholars, my good lord.  SIMONIDES. Let me ask you one thing: What do you think of my daughter, sir?  PERICLES. A most virtuous princess.  SIMONIDES. And she is fair too, is she not?  PERICLES. As a fair day in summer, wondrous fair.  SIMONIDES. Sir, my daughter thinks very well of you; Ay, so well, that you must be her master, And she will be your scholar: therefore look to it.  PERICLES. I am unworthy for her schoolmaster.  SIMONIDES. She thinks not so; peruse this writing else.  PERICLES. [_Aside._] What’s here? A letter, that she loves the knight of Tyre! ’Tis the king’s subtlety to have my life. O, seek not to entrap me, gracious lord, A stranger and distressed gentleman, That never aim’d so high to love your daughter, But bent all offices to honour her.  SIMONIDES. Thou hast bewitch’d my daughter, And thou art a villain.  PERICLES. By the gods, I have not: Never did thought of mine levy offence; Nor never did my actions yet commence A deed might gain her love or your displeasure.  SIMONIDES. Traitor, thou liest.  PERICLES. Traitor?  SIMONIDES. Ay, traitor.  PERICLES. Even in his throat—unless it be the king— That calls me traitor, I return the lie.  SIMONIDES. [_Aside._] Now, by the gods, I do applaud his courage.  PERICLES. My actions are as noble as my thoughts, That never relish’d of a base descent. I came unto your court for honour’s cause, And not to be a rebel to her state; And he that otherwise accounts of me, This sword shall prove he’s honour’s enemy.  SIMONIDES. No? Here comes my daughter, she can witness it.   Enter Thaisa.  PERICLES. Then, as you are as virtuous as fair, Resolve your angry father, if my tongue Did e’er solicit, or my hand subscribe To any syllable that made love to you.  THAISA. Why, sir, say if you had, Who takes offence at that would make me glad?  SIMONIDES. Yea, mistress, are you so peremptory? [_Aside._] I am glad on’t with all my heart.— I’ll tame you; I’ll bring you in subjection. Will you, not having my consent, Bestow your love and your affections Upon a stranger? [_Aside._] Who, for aught I know May be, nor can I think the contrary, As great in blood as I myself.— Therefore hear you, mistress; either frame Your will to mine, and you, sir, hear you, Either be ruled by me, or I will make you— Man and wife. Nay, come, your hands, And lips must seal it too: and being join’d, I’ll thus your hopes destroy; and for further grief, God give you joy! What, are you both pleased?  THAISA. Yes, if you love me, sir.  PERICLES. Even as my life my blood that fosters it.  SIMONIDES. What, are you both agreed?  BOTH. Yes, if’t please your majesty.  SIMONIDES. It pleaseth me so well, that I will see you wed; And then with what haste you can, get you to bed.   [_Exeunt._]
  ACT III
 SCENE I.   Enter Pericles, on shipboard.  PERICLES. Thou god of this great vast, rebuke these surges, Which wash both heaven and hell; and thou that hast Upon the winds command, bind them in brass, Having call’d them from the deep! O, still Thy deafening, dreadful thunders; gently quench Thy nimble, sulphurous flashes! O, how, Lychorida, How does my queen? Thou stormest venomously; Wilt thou spit all thyself? The seaman’s whistle Is as a whisper in the ears of death, Unheard. Lychorida! - Lucina, O! Divinest patroness, and midwife gentle To those that cry by night, convey thy deity Aboard our dancing boat; make swift the pangs Of my queen’s travails! Now, Lychorida!   Enter Lychorida with an infant.  LYCHORIDA. Here is a thing too young for such a place, Who, if it had conceit, would die, as I Am like to do: take in your arms this piece Of your dead queen.  PERICLES. How? how, Lychorida?  LYCHORIDA. Patience, good sir; do not assist the storm. Here’s all that is left living of your queen, A little daughter: for the sake of it, Be manly, and take comfort.  PERICLES. O you gods! Why do you make us love your goodly gifts, And snatch them straight away? We here below Recall not what we give, and therein may Vie honour with you.  LYCHORIDA. Patience, good sir. Even for this charge.  PERICLES. Now, mild may be thy life! For a more blustrous birth had never babe: Quiet and gentle thy conditions! for Thou art the rudeliest welcome to this world That ever was prince’s child. Happy what follows! Thou hast as chiding a nativity As fire, air, water, earth, and heaven can make, To herald thee from the womb. Even at the first thy loss is more than can Thy portage quit, with all thou canst find here, Now, the good gods throw their best eyes upon’t!   Enter two Sailors  FIRST SAILOR. What courage, sir? God save you!  PERICLES. Courage enough: I do not fear the flaw; It hath done to me the worst. Yet, for the love Of this poor infant, this fresh new sea-farer, I would it would be quiet.  FIRST SAILOR. Slack the bolins there! Thou wilt not, wilt thou? Blow, and split thyself.  SECOND SAILOR. But sea-room, and the brine and cloudy billow kiss the moon, I care not.  FIRST SAILOR. Sir, your queen must overboard: the sea works high, the wind is loud and will not lie till the ship be cleared of the dead.  PERICLES. That’s your superstition.  FIRST SAILOR. Pardon us, sir; with us at sea it has been still observed; and we are strong in custom. Therefore briefly yield her; for she must overboard straight.  PERICLES. As you think meet. Most wretched queen!  LYCHORIDA. Here she lies, sir.  PERICLES. A terrible childbed hast thou had, my dear; No light, no fire: th’unfriendly elements Forgot thee utterly; nor have I time To give thee hallow’d to thy grave, but straight Must cast thee, scarcely coffin’d, in the ooze; Where, for a monument upon thy bones, And e’er-remaining lamps, the belching whale And humming water must o’erwhelm thy corpse, Lying with simple shells. O Lychorida. Bid Nestor bring me spices, ink and paper, My casket and my jewels; and bid Nicander Bring me the satin coffer: lay the babe Upon the pillow: hie thee, whiles I say A priestly farewell to her: suddenly, woman.   [_Exit Lychorida._]  SECOND SAILOR. Sir, we have a chest beneath the hatches, caulked and bitumed ready.  PERICLES. I thank thee. Mariner, say what coast is this?  SECOND SAILOR. We are near Tarsus.  PERICLES. Thither, gentle mariner, Alter thy course for Tyre. When canst thou reach it?  SECOND SAILOR. By break of day, if the wind cease.  PERICLES. O, make for Tarsus! There will I visit Cleon, for the babe Cannot hold out to Tyrus. There I’ll leave it At careful nursing. Go thy ways, good mariner: I’ll bring the body presently.   [_Exeunt._]
 SCENE II. Ephesus. A room in Cerimon’s house.   Enter Cerimon, with a Servant, and some Persons who have been  shipwrecked.  CERIMON. Philemon, ho!   Enter Philemon.  PHILEMON. Doth my lord call?  CERIMON. Get fire and meat for these poor men: ’T has been a turbulent and stormy night.  SERVANT. I have been in many; but such a night as this, Till now, I ne’er endured.  CERIMON. Your master will be dead ere you return; There’s nothing can be minister’d to nature That can recover him. [_To Philemon._] Give this to the ’pothecary, And tell me how it works.   [_Exeunt all but Cerimon._]   Enter two Gentlemen.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Good morrow.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Good morrow to your lordship.  CERIMON. Gentlemen, why do you stir so early?  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Sir, our lodgings, standing bleak upon the sea, Shook as the earth did quake; The very principals did seem to rend, And all to topple: pure surprise and fear Made me to quit the house.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. That is the cause we trouble you so early; ’Tis not our husbandry.  CERIMON. O, you say well.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. But I much marvel that your lordship, having Rich tire about you, should at these early hours Shake off the golden slumber of repose. ’Tis most strange, Nature should be so conversant with pain. Being thereto not compell’d.  CERIMON. I hold it ever, Virtue and cunning were endowments greater Than nobleness and riches: careless heirs May the two latter darken and expend; But immortality attends the former, Making a man a god. ’Tis known, I ever Have studied physic, through which secret art, By turning o’er authorities, I have, Together with my practice, made familiar To me and to my aid the blest infusions That dwell in vegetives, in metals, stones; And I can speak of the disturbances That nature works, and of her cures; which doth give me A more content in course of true delight Than to be thirsty after tottering honour, Or tie my pleasure up in silken bags, To please the fool and death.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Your honour has through Ephesus pour’d forth Your charity, and hundreds call themselves Your creatures, who by you have been restored: And not your knowledge, your personal pain, but even Your purse, still open, hath built Lord Cerimon Such strong renown as time shall never—   Enter two or three Servants with a chest.  FIRST SERVANT. So, lift there.  CERIMON. What’s that?  FIRST SERVANT. Sir, even now Did the sea toss upon our shore this chest: ’Tis of some wreck.  CERIMON. Set’t down, let’s look upon’t.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. ’Tis like a coffin, sir.  CERIMON. Whate’er it be, ’Tis wondrous heavy. Wrench it open straight: If the sea’s stomach be o’ercharged with gold, ’Tis a good constraint of fortune it belches upon us.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. ’Tis so, my lord.  CERIMON. How close ’tis caulk’d and bitumed! Did the sea cast it up?  FIRST SERVANT. I never saw so huge a billow, sir, As toss’d it upon shore.  CERIMON. Wrench it open; Soft! it smells most sweetly in my sense.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. A delicate odour.  CERIMON. As ever hit my nostril. So up with it. O you most potent gods! what’s here? a corpse!  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Most strange!  CERIMON. Shrouded in cloth of state; balm’d and entreasured With full bags of spices! A passport too! Apollo, perfect me in the characters!   [_Reads from a scroll._]       _Here I give to understand,      If e’er this coffin drives a-land,      I, King Pericles, have lost      This queen, worth all our mundane cost.      Who finds her, give her burying;      She was the daughter of a king:      Besides this treasure for a fee,      The gods requite his charity._ If thou livest, Pericles, thou hast a heart That even cracks for woe! This chanced tonight.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Most likely, sir.  CERIMON. Nay, certainly tonight; For look how fresh she looks! They were too rough That threw her in the sea. Make a fire within Fetch hither all my boxes in my closet.   [_Exit a Servant._]  Death may usurp on nature many hours, And yet the fire of life kindle again The o’erpress’d spirits. I heard of an Egyptian That had nine hours lain dead, Who was by good appliance recovered.   Re-enter a Servant with napkins and fire.  Well said, well said; the fire and cloths. The rough and woeful music that we have, Cause it to sound, beseech you The viol once more: how thou stirr’st, thou block! The music there!—I pray you, give her air. Gentlemen, this queen will live. Nature awakes; a warmth breathes out of her. She hath not been entranced above five hours. See how she ’gins to blow into life’s flower again!  FIRST GENTLEMAN. The heavens, through you, increase our wonder And sets up your fame for ever.  CERIMON. She is alive; behold, her eyelids, Cases to those heavenly jewels which Pericles hath lost, Begin to part their fringes of bright gold; The diamonds of a most praised water doth appear, To make the world twice rich. Live, and make us weep To hear your fate, fair creature, rare as you seem to be.   [_She moves._]  THAISA. O dear Diana, Where am I? Where’s my lord? What world is this?  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Is not this strange?  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Most rare.  CERIMON. Hush, my gentle neighbours! Lend me your hands; to the next chamber bear her. Get linen: now this matter must be look’d to, For her relapse is mortal. Come, come; And Aesculapius guide us!   [_Exeunt, carrying her away._]
 SCENE III. Tarsus. A room in Cleon’s house.   Enter Pericles, Cleon, Dionyza and Lychorida with Marina in her arms.  PERICLES. Most honour’d Cleon, I must needs be gone; My twelve months are expired, and Tyrus stands In a litigious peace. You and your lady, Take from my heart all thankfulness! The gods Make up the rest upon you!  CLEON. Your shafts of fortune, though they hurt you mortally, Yet glance full wanderingly on us.  DIONYZA. O, your sweet queen! That the strict fates had pleased you had brought her hither, To have bless’d mine eyes with her!  PERICLES. We cannot but obey The powers above us. Could I rage and roar As doth the sea she lies in, yet the end Must be as ’tis. My gentle babe Marina, Whom, for she was born at sea, I have named so, Here I charge your charity withal, Leaving her the infant of your care; Beseeching you to give her princely training, That she may be manner’d as she is born.  CLEON. Fear not, my lord, but think Your grace, that fed my country with your corn, For which the people’s prayers still fall upon you, Must in your child be thought on. If neglection Should therein make me vile, the common body, By you relieved, would force me to my duty: But if to that my nature need a spur, The gods revenge it upon me and mine, To the end of generation!  PERICLES. I believe you; Your honour and your goodness teach me to’t, Without your vows. Till she be married, madam, By bright Diana, whom we honour, all Unscissored shall this hair of mine remain, Though I show ill in’t. So I take my leave. Good madam, make me blessed in your care In bringing up my child.  DIONYZA. I have one myself, Who shall not be more dear to my respect Than yours, my lord.  PERICLES. Madam, my thanks and prayers.  CLEON. We’ll bring your grace e’en to the edge o’the shore, Then give you up to the mask’d Neptune and The gentlest winds of heaven.  PERICLES. I will embrace your offer. Come, dearest madam. O, no tears, Lychorida, no tears. Look to your little mistress, on whose grace You may depend hereafter. Come, my lord.   [_Exeunt._]
 SCENE IV. Ephesus. A room in Cerimon’s house.   Enter Cerimon and Thaisa.  CERIMON. Madam, this letter, and some certain jewels, Lay with you in your coffer, which are At your command. Know you the character?  THAISA. It is my lord’s. That I was shipp’d at sea, I well remember, Even on my groaning time; but whether there Deliver’d, by the holy gods, I cannot rightly say. But since King Pericles, My wedded lord, I ne’er shall see again, A vestal livery will I take me to, And never more have joy.  CERIMON. Madam, if this you purpose as ye speak, Diana’s temple is not distant far, Where you may abide till your date expire. Moreover, if you please, a niece of mine Shall there attend you.  THAISA. My recompense is thanks, that’s all; Yet my good will is great, though the gift small.   [_Exeunt._]
  ACT IV
 Enter Gower.  GOWER. Imagine Pericles arrived at Tyre, Welcomed and settled to his own desire. His woeful queen we leave at Ephesus, Unto Diana there a votaress. Now to Marina bend your mind, Whom our fast-growing scene must find At Tarsus, and by Cleon train’d In music’s letters; who hath gain’d Of education all the grace, Which makes her both the heart and place Of general wonder. But, alack, That monster envy, oft the wrack Of earned praise, Marina’s life Seeks to take off by treason’s knife, And in this kind our Cleon hath One daughter, and a full grown wench Even ripe for marriage-rite; this maid Hight Philoten: and it is said For certain in our story, she Would ever with Marina be. Be’t when she weaved the sleided silk With fingers long, small, white as milk; Or when she would with sharp needle wound, The cambric, which she made more sound By hurting it; or when to th’ lute She sung, and made the night-bird mute That still records with moan; or when She would with rich and constant pen Vail to her mistress Dian; still This Philoten contends in skill With absolute Marina: so The dove of Paphos might with the crow Vie feathers white. Marina gets All praises, which are paid as debts, And not as given. This so darks In Philoten all graceful marks, That Cleon’s wife, with envy rare, A present murderer does prepare For good Marina, that her daughter Might stand peerless by this slaughter. The sooner her vile thoughts to stead, Lychorida, our nurse, is dead: And cursed Dionyza hath The pregnant instrument of wrath Prest for this blow. The unborn event I do commend to your content: Only I carry winged time Post on the lame feet of my rhyme; Which never could I so convey, Unless your thoughts went on my way. Dionyza does appear, With Leonine, a murderer.   [_Exit._]
 Scene I. Tarsus. An open place near the seashore.   Enter Dionyza with Leonine.  DIONYZA. Thy oath remember; thou hast sworn to do’t: ’Tis but a blow, which never shall be known. Thou canst not do a thing in the world so soon, To yield thee so much profit. Let not conscience, Which is but cold, inflaming love i’ thy bosom, Inflame too nicely; nor let pity, which Even women have cast off, melt thee, but be A soldier to thy purpose.  LEONINE. I will do’t; but yet she is a goodly creature.  DIONYZA. The fitter, then, the gods should have her. Here she comes weeping for her only mistress’ death. Thou art resolved?  LEONINE. I am resolved.   Enter Marina with a basket of flowers.  MARINA. No, I will rob Tellus of her weed To strew thy green with flowers: the yellows, blues, The purple violets, and marigolds, Shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave, While summer days do last. Ay me! poor maid, Born in a tempest, when my mother died, This world to me is like a lasting storm, Whirring me from my friends.  DIONYZA. How now, Marina! why do you keep alone? How chance my daughter is not with you? Do not consume your blood with sorrowing; Have you a nurse of me? Lord, how your favour’s Changed with this unprofitable woe! Come, give me your flowers, ere the sea mar it. Walk with Leonine; the air is quick there, And it pierces and sharpens the stomach. Come, Leonine, take her by the arm, walk with her.  MARINA. No, I pray you; I’ll not bereave you of your servant.  DIONYZA. Come, come; I love the king your father, and yourself, With more than foreign heart. We every day Expect him here: when he shall come and find Our paragon to all reports thus blasted, He will repent the breadth of his great voyage; Blame both my lord and me, that we have taken No care to your best courses. Go, I pray you, Walk, and be cheerful once again; reserve That excellent complexion, which did steal The eyes of young and old. Care not for me; I can go home alone.  MARINA. Well, I will go; But yet I have no desire to it.  DIONYZA. Come, come, I know ’tis good for you. Walk half an hour, Leonine, at the least: Remember what I have said.  LEONINE. I warrant you, madam.  DIONYZA. I’ll leave you, my sweet lady, for a while: Pray, walk softly, do not heat your blood: What! I must have a care of you.  MARINA. My thanks, sweet madam.   [_Exit Dionyza._]  Is this wind westerly that blows?  LEONINE. South-west.  MARINA. When I was born the wind was north.  LEONINE. Was’t so?  MARINA. My father, as nurse said, did never fear, But cried ‘Good seamen!’ to the sailors, Galling his kingly hands, haling ropes; And clasping to the mast, endured a sea That almost burst the deck.  LEONINE. When was this?  MARINA. When I was born: Never was waves nor wind more violent; And from the ladder tackle washes off A canvas-climber. ‘Ha!’ says one, ‘wolt out?’ And with a dropping industry they skip From stem to stern: the boatswain whistles, and The master calls and trebles their confusion.  LEONINE. Come, say your prayers.  MARINA. What mean you?  LEONINE. If you require a little space for prayer, I grant it: pray; but be not tedious, For the gods are quick of ear, and I am sworn To do my work with haste.  MARINA. Why will you kill me?  LEONINE. To satisfy my lady.  MARINA. Why would she have me kill’d now? As I can remember, by my troth, I never did her hurt in all my life: I never spake bad word, nor did ill turn To any living creature: believe me, la, I never kill’d a mouse, nor hurt a fly: I trod upon a worm against my will, But I wept for it. How have I offended, Wherein my death might yield her any profit, Or my life imply her any danger?  LEONINE. My commission Is not to reason of the deed, but do it.  MARINA. You will not do’t for all the world, I hope. You are well favour’d, and your looks foreshow You have a gentle heart. I saw you lately, When you caught hurt in parting two that fought: Good sooth, it show’d well in you: do so now: Your lady seeks my life; come you between, And save poor me, the weaker.  LEONINE. I am sworn, And will dispatch.   [_He seizes her._]   Enter Pirates.  FIRST PIRATE. Hold, villain!   [_Leonine runs away._]  SECOND PIRATE. A prize! a prize!  THIRD PIRATE. Half part, mates, half part, Come, let’s have her aboard suddenly.   [_Exeunt Pirates with Marina._]   Re-enter Leonine.  LEONINE. These roguing thieves serve the great pirate Valdes; And they have seized Marina. Let her go: There’s no hope she will return. I’ll swear she’s dead And thrown into the sea. But I’ll see further: Perhaps they will but please themselves upon her, Not carry her aboard. If she remain, Whom they have ravish’d must by me be slain.   [_Exit._]
 Scene II. Mytilene. A room in a brothel.   Enter Pandar, Bawd and Boult.  PANDAR. Boult!  BOULT. Sir?  PANDAR. Search the market narrowly; Mytilene is full of gallants. We lost too much money this mart by being too wenchless.  BAWD. We were never so much out of creatures. We have but poor three, and they can do no more than they can do; and they with continual action are even as good as rotten.  PANDAR. Therefore let’s have fresh ones, whate’er we pay for them. If there be not a conscience to be used in every trade, we shall never prosper.  BAWD. Thou sayest true: ’tis not our bringing up of poor bastards,—as, I think, I have brought up some eleven—  BOULT. Ay, to eleven; and brought them down again. But shall I search the market?  BAWD. What else, man? The stuff we have, a strong wind will blow it to pieces, they are so pitifully sodden.  PANDAR. Thou sayest true; they’re too unwholesome, o’ conscience. The poor Transylvanian is dead, that lay with the little baggage.  BOULT. Ay, she quickly pooped him; she made him roast-meat for worms. But I’ll go search the market.   [_Exit._]  PANDAR. Three or four thousand chequins were as pretty a proportion to live quietly, and so give over.  BAWD. Why to give over, I pray you? Is it a shame to get when we are old?  PANDAR. O, our credit comes not in like the commodity, nor the commodity wages not with the danger: therefore, if in our youths we could pick up some pretty estate, ’twere not amiss to keep our door hatched. Besides, the sore terms we stand upon with the gods will be strong with us for giving over.  BAWD. Come, others sorts offend as well as we.  PANDAR. As well as we! ay, and better too; we offend worse. Neither is our profession any trade; it’s no calling. But here comes Boult.   Re-enter Boult, with the Pirates and Marina.  BOULT [_To Pirates._] Come your ways. My masters, you say she’s a virgin?  FIRST PIRATE. O sir, we doubt it not.  BOULT. Master, I have gone through for this piece, you see: if you like her, so; if not, I have lost my earnest.  BAWD. Boult, has she any qualities?  BOULT. She has a good face, speaks well and has excellent good clothes: there’s no farther necessity of qualities can make her be refused.  BAWD. What is her price, Boult?  BOULT. I cannot be baited one doit of a thousand pieces.  PANDAR. Well, follow me, my masters, you shall have your money presently. Wife, take her in; instruct her what she has to do, that she may not be raw in her entertainment.   [_Exeunt Pandar and Pirates._]  BAWD. Boult, take you the marks of her, the colour of her hair, complexion, height, her age, with warrant of her virginity; and cry ‘He that will give most shall have her first.’ Such a maidenhead were no cheap thing, if men were as they have been. Get this done as I command you.  BOULT. Performance shall follow.   [_Exit._]  MARINA. Alack that Leonine was so slack, so slow! He should have struck, not spoke; or that these pirates, Not enough barbarous, had not o’erboard thrown me For to seek my mother!  BAWD. Why lament you, pretty one?  MARINA. That I am pretty.  BAWD. Come, the gods have done their part in you.  MARINA. I accuse them not.  BAWD. You are light into my hands, where you are like to live.  MARINA. The more my fault To scape his hands where I was like to die.  BAWD. Ay, and you shall live in pleasure.  MARINA. No.  BAWD. Yes, indeed shall you, and taste gentlemen of all fashions: you shall fare well; you shall have the difference of all complexions. What! do you stop your ears?  MARINA. Are you a woman?  BAWD. What would you have me be, an I be not a woman?  MARINA. An honest woman, or not a woman.  BAWD. Marry, whip the gosling: I think I shall have something to do with you. Come, you’re a young foolish sapling, and must be bowed as I would have you.  MARINA. The gods defend me!  BAWD. If it please the gods to defend you by men, then men must comfort you, men must feed you, men stir you up. Boult’s returned.   Re-enter Boult.  Now, sir, hast thou cried her through the market?  BOULT. I have cried her almost to the number of her hairs; I have drawn her picture with my voice.  BAWD. And I prithee tell me, how dost thou find the inclination of the people, especially of the younger sort?  BOULT. Faith, they listened to me as they would have hearkened to their father’s testament. There was a Spaniard’s mouth so watered, that he went to bed to her very description.  BAWD. We shall have him here tomorrow with his best ruff on.  BOULT. Tonight, tonight. But, mistress, do you know the French knight that cowers i’ the hams?  BAWD. Who, Monsieur Veroles?  BOULT. Ay, he: he offered to cut a caper at the proclamation; but he made a groan at it, and swore he would see her tomorrow.  BAWD. Well, well, as for him, he brought his disease hither: here he does but repair it. I know he will come in our shadow, to scatter his crowns in the sun.  BOULT. Well, if we had of every nation a traveller, we should lodge them with this sign.   [_To Marina._] Pray you, come hither awhile. You have fortunes coming  upon you. Mark me: you must seem to do that fearfully which you commit  willingly, despise profit where you have most gain. To weep that you  live as ye do makes pity in your lovers: seldom but that pity begets  you a good opinion, and that opinion a mere profit.  MARINA. I understand you not.  BOULT. O, take her home, mistress, take her home: these blushes of hers must be quenched with some present practice.  BAWD. Thou sayest true, i’faith so they must; for your bride goes to that with shame which is her way to go with warrant.  BOULT. Faith, some do and some do not. But, mistress, if I have bargained for the joint,—  BAWD. Thou mayst cut a morsel off the spit.  BOULT. I may so.  BAWD. Who should deny it? Come young one, I like the manner of your garments well.  BOULT. Ay, by my faith, they shall not be changed yet.  BAWD. Boult, spend thou that in the town: report what a sojourner we have; you’ll lose nothing by custom. When nature framed this piece, she meant thee a good turn; therefore say what a paragon she is, and thou hast the harvest out of thine own report.  BOULT. I warrant you, mistress, thunder shall not so awake the beds of eels as my giving out her beauty stirs up the lewdly inclined. I’ll bring home some tonight.  BAWD. Come your ways; follow me.  MARINA. If fires be hot, knives sharp, or waters deep, Untied I still my virgin knot will keep. Diana, aid my purpose!  BAWD. What have we to do with Diana? Pray you, will you go with us?   [_Exeunt._]
 SCENE III. Tarsus. A room in Cleon’s house.   Enter Cleon and Dionyza.  DIONYZA. Why, are you foolish? Can it be undone?  CLEON. O, Dionyza, such a piece of slaughter The sun and moon ne’er look’d upon!  DIONYZA. I think you’ll turn a child again.  CLEON. Were I chief lord of all this spacious world, I’d give it to undo the deed. A lady, Much less in blood than virtue, yet a princess To equal any single crown o’ the earth I’ the justice of compare! O villain Leonine! Whom thou hast poison’d too: If thou hadst drunk to him, ’t had been a kindness Becoming well thy face. What canst thou say When noble Pericles shall demand his child?  DIONYZA. That she is dead. Nurses are not the fates, To foster it, nor ever to preserve. She died at night; I’ll say so. Who can cross it? Unless you play the pious innocent, And for an honest attribute cry out ‘She died by foul play.’  CLEON. O, go to. Well, well, Of all the faults beneath the heavens, the gods Do like this worst.  DIONYZA. Be one of those that thinks The petty wrens of Tarsus will fly hence, And open this to Pericles. I do shame To think of what a noble strain you are, And of how coward a spirit.  CLEON. To such proceeding Whoever but his approbation added, Though not his prime consent, he did not flow From honourable courses.  DIONYZA. Be it so, then: Yet none does know, but you, how she came dead, Nor none can know, Leonine being gone. She did distain my child, and stood between Her and her fortunes: none would look on her, But cast their gazes on Marina’s face; Whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin Not worth the time of day. It pierced me through; And though you call my course unnatural, You not your child well loving, yet I find It greets me as an enterprise of kindness Perform’d to your sole daughter.  CLEON. Heavens forgive it!  DIONYZA. And as for Pericles, what should he say? We wept after her hearse, and yet we mourn. Her monument is almost finish’d, and her epitaphs In glittering golden characters express A general praise to her, and care in us At whose expense ’tis done.  CLEON. Thou art like the harpy, Which, to betray, dost, with thine angel’s face, Seize with thine eagle’s talons.  DIONYZA. You are like one that superstitiously Doth swear to the gods that winter kills the flies: But yet I know you’ll do as I advise.   [_Exeunt._]
 SCENE IV.   Enter Gower, before the monument of Marina at Tarsus.  GOWER. Thus time we waste, and long leagues make short; Sail seas in cockles, have and wish but for’t; Making, to take your imagination, From bourn to bourn, region to region. By you being pardon’d, we commit no crime To use one language in each several clime Where our scenes seem to live. I do beseech you To learn of me, who stand i’the gaps to teach you, The stages of our story. Pericles Is now again thwarting the wayward seas Attended on by many a lord and knight, To see his daughter, all his life’s delight. Old Helicanus goes along. Behind Is left to govern, if you bear in mind, Old Escanes, whom Helicanus late Advanced in time to great and high estate. Well-sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought This king to Tarsus,—think his pilot thought; So with his steerage shall your thoughts go on,— To fetch his daughter home, who first is gone. Like motes and shadows see them move awhile; Your ears unto your eyes I’ll reconcile.   Dumb-show. Enter Pericles at one door with all his train; Cleon and  Dionyza at the other. Cleon shows Pericles the tomb; whereat Pericles  makes lamentation, puts on sackcloth and in a mighty passion departs.  Then exeunt Cleon and Dionyza.  See how belief may suffer by foul show; This borrow’d passion stands for true old woe; And Pericles, in sorrow all devour’d, With sighs shot through; and biggest tears o’ershower’d, Leaves Tarsus and again embarks. He swears Never to wash his face, nor cut his hairs: He puts on sackcloth, and to sea he bears A tempest, which his mortal vessel tears, And yet he rides it out. Now please you wit The epitaph is for Marina writ By wicked Dionyza.   [_Reads the inscription on Marina’s monument._]       _The fairest, sweet’st, and best lies here,      Who wither’d in her spring of year.      She was of Tyrus the King’s daughter,      On whom foul death hath made this slaughter;      Marina was she call’d; and at her birth,      Thetis, being proud, swallow’d some part o’ the earth:      Therefore the earth, fearing to be o’erflow’d,      Hath Thetis’ birth-child on the heavens bestow’d:      Wherefore she does, and swears she’ll never stint,      Make raging battery upon shores of flint._  No visor does become black villany So well as soft and tender flattery. Let Pericles believe his daughter’s dead, And bear his courses to be ordered By Lady Fortune; while our scene must play His daughter’s woe and heavy well-a-day In her unholy service. Patience, then, And think you now are all in Mytilene.   [_Exit._]
 SCENE V. Mytilene. A street before the brothel.   Enter, from the brothel, two Gentlemen.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Did you ever hear the like?  SECOND GENTLEMAN. No, nor never shall do in such a place as this, she being once gone.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. But to have divinity preached there! did you ever dream of such a thing?  SECOND GENTLEMAN. No, no. Come, I am for no more bawdy houses: shall’s go hear the vestals sing?  FIRST GENTLEMAN. I’ll do anything now that is virtuous; but I am out of the road of rutting for ever.   [_Exeunt._]
 SCENE VI. The same. A room in the brothel.   Enter Pandar, Bawd and Boult.  PANDAR. Well, I had rather than twice the worth of her she had ne’er come here.  BAWD. Fie, fie upon her! She’s able to freeze the god Priapus, and undo a whole generation. We must either get her ravished, or be rid of her. When she should do for clients her fitment, and do me the kindness of our profession, she has me her quirks, her reasons, her master reasons, her prayers, her knees; that she would make a puritan of the devil, if he should cheapen a kiss of her.  BOULT. Faith, I must ravish her, or she’ll disfurnish us of all our cavaliers, and make our swearers priests.  PANDAR. Now, the pox upon her green sickness for me!  BAWD. Faith, there’s no way to be rid on’t but by the way to the pox. Here comes the Lord Lysimachus disguised.  BOULT. We should have both lord and lown, if the peevish baggage would but give way to customers.   Enter Lysimachus.  LYSIMACHUS. How now! How a dozen of virginities?  BAWD. Now, the gods to bless your honour!  BOULT. I am glad to see your honour in good health.  LYSIMACHUS. You may so; ’tis the better for you that your resorters stand upon sound legs. How now? Wholesome iniquity have you that a man may deal withal, and defy the surgeon?  BAWD. We have here one, sir, if she would—but there never came her like in Mytilene.  LYSIMACHUS. If she’d do the deed of darkness, thou wouldst say.  BAWD. Your honour knows what ’tis to say well enough.  LYSIMACHUS. Well, call forth, call forth.  BOULT. For flesh and blood, sir, white and red, you shall see a rose; and she were a rose indeed, if she had but—  LYSIMACHUS. What, prithee?  BOULT. O, sir, I can be modest.  LYSIMACHUS. That dignifies the renown of a bawd no less than it gives a good report to a number to be chaste.   [_Exit Boult._]  BAWD. Here comes that which grows to the stalk; never plucked yet, I can assure you.   Re-enter Boult with Marina.  Is she not a fair creature?  LYSIMACHUS. Faith, she would serve after a long voyage at sea. Well, there’s for you: leave us.  BAWD. I beseech your honour, give me leave: a word, and I’ll have done presently.  LYSIMACHUS. I beseech you, do.  BAWD. [_To Marina._] First, I would have you note, this is an honourable man.  MARINA. I desire to find him so, that I may worthily note him.  BAWD. Next, he’s the governor of this country, and a man whom I am bound to.  MARINA. If he govern the country, you are bound to him indeed; but how honourable he is in that, I know not.  BAWD. Pray you, without any more virginal fencing, will you use him kindly? He will line your apron with gold.  MARINA. What he will do graciously, I will thankfully receive.  LYSIMACHUS. Ha’ you done?  BAWD. My lord, she’s not paced yet: you must take some pains to work her to your manage. Come, we will leave his honour and her together. Go thy ways.   [_Exeunt Bawd, Pandar and Boult._]  LYSIMACHUS. Now, pretty one, how long have you been at this trade?  MARINA. What trade, sir?  LYSIMACHUS. Why, I cannot name’t but I shall offend.  MARINA. I cannot be offended with my trade. Please you to name it.  LYSIMACHUS. How long have you been of this profession?  MARINA. E’er since I can remember.  LYSIMACHUS. Did you go to’t so young? Were you a gamester at five or at seven?  MARINA. Earlier, too, sir, if now I be one.  LYSIMACHUS. Why, the house you dwell in proclaims you to be a creature of sale.  MARINA. Do you know this house to be a place of such resort, and will come into’t? I hear say you are of honourable parts, and are the governor of this place.  LYSIMACHUS. Why, hath your principal made known unto you who I am?  MARINA. Who is my principal?  LYSIMACHUS. Why, your herb-woman; she that sets seeds and roots of shame and iniquity. O, you have heard something of my power, and so stand aloof for more serious wooing. But I protest to thee, pretty one, my authority shall not see thee, or else look friendly upon thee. Come, bring me to some private place: come, come.  MARINA. If you were born to honour, show it now; If put upon you, make the judgement good That thought you worthy of it.  LYSIMACHUS. How’s this? how’s this? Some more; be sage.  MARINA. For me, That am a maid, though most ungentle Fortune Have placed me in this sty, where, since I came, Diseases have been sold dearer than physic, O, that the gods Would set me free from this unhallow’d place, Though they did change me to the meanest bird That flies i’ the purer air!  LYSIMACHUS. I did not think Thou couldst have spoke so well; ne’er dream’d thou couldst. Had I brought hither a corrupted mind, Thy speech had alter’d it. Hold, here’s gold for thee: Persever in that clear way thou goest, And the gods strengthen thee!  MARINA. The good gods preserve you!  LYSIMACHUS. For me, be you thoughten That I came with no ill intent; for to me The very doors and windows savour vilely. Fare thee well. Thou art a piece of virtue, and I doubt not but thy training hath been noble. Hold, here’s more gold for thee. A curse upon him, die he like a thief, That robs thee of thy goodness! If thou dost Hear from me, it shall be for thy good.   Re-enter Boult.  BOULT. I beseech your honour, one piece for me.  LYSIMACHUS. Avaunt, thou damned door-keeper! Your house but for this virgin that doth prop it, Would sink and overwhelm you. Away!   [_Exit._]  BOULT. How’s this? We must take another course with you. If your peevish chastity, which is not worth a breakfast in the cheapest country under the cope, shall undo a whole household, let me be gelded like a spaniel. Come your ways.  MARINA. Whither would you have me?  BOULT. I must have your maidenhead taken off, or the common hangman shall execute it. Come your ways. We’ll have no more gentlemen driven away. Come your ways, I say.   Re-enter Bawd.  BAWD. How now! what’s the matter?  BOULT. Worse and worse, mistress; she has here spoken holy words to the Lord Lysimachus.  BAWD. O, abominable!  BOULT. She makes our profession as it were to stink afore the face of the gods.  BAWD. Marry, hang her up for ever!  BOULT. The nobleman would have dealt with her like a nobleman, and she sent him away as cold as a snowball; saying his prayers too.  BAWD. Boult, take her away; use her at thy pleasure: crack the glass of her virginity, and make the rest malleable.  BOULT. An if she were a thornier piece of ground than she is, she shall be ploughed.  MARINA. Hark, hark, you gods!  BAWD. She conjures: away with her! Would she had never come within my doors! Marry, hang you! She’s born to undo us. Will you not go the way of womankind? Marry, come up, my dish of chastity with rosemary and bays!   [_Exit._]  BOULT. Come, mistress; come your way with me.  MARINA. Whither wilt thou have me?  BOULT. To take from you the jewel you hold so dear.  MARINA. Prithee, tell me one thing first.  BOULT. Come now, your one thing?  MARINA. What canst thou wish thine enemy to be?  BOULT. Why, I could wish him to be my master, or rather, my mistress.  MARINA. Neither of these are so bad as thou art, Since they do better thee in their command. Thou hold’st a place, for which the pained’st fiend Of hell would not in reputation change: Thou art the damned doorkeeper to every Coistrel that comes inquiring for his Tib. To the choleric fisting of every rogue Thy ear is liable, thy food is such As hath been belch’d on by infected lungs.  BOULT. What would you have me do? Go to the wars, would you? where a man may serve seven years for the loss of a leg, and have not money enough in the end to buy him a wooden one?  MARINA. Do anything but this thou doest. Empty Old receptacles, or common shores, of filth; Serve by indenture to the common hangman: Any of these ways are yet better than this; For what thou professest, a baboon, could he speak, Would own a name too dear. O, that the gods Would safely deliver me from this place! Here, here’s gold for thee. If that thy master would gain by me, Proclaim that I can sing, weave, sew, and dance, With other virtues, which I’ll keep from boast; And I will undertake all these to teach. I doubt not but this populous city will Yield many scholars.  BOULT. But can you teach all this you speak of?  MARINA. Prove that I cannot, take me home again, And prostitute me to the basest groom That doth frequent your house.  BOULT. Well, I will see what I can do for thee: if I can place thee, I will.  MARINA. But amongst honest women.  BOULT. Faith, my acquaintance lies little amongst them. But since my master and mistress have bought you, there’s no going but by their consent: therefore I will make them acquainted with your purpose, and I doubt not but I shall find them tractable enough. Come, I’ll do for thee what I can; come your ways.   [_Exeunt._]
  ACT V
 Enter Gower.  GOWER. Marina thus the brothel ’scapes, and chances Into an honest house, our story says. She sings like one immortal, and she dances As goddess-like to her admired lays; Deep clerks she dumbs; and with her nee’le composes Nature’s own shape, of bud, bird, branch, or berry, That even her art sisters the natural roses; Her inkle, silk, twin with the rubied cherry: That pupils lacks she none of noble race, Who pour their bounty on her; and her gain She gives the cursed bawd. Here we her place; And to her father turn our thoughts again, Where we left him, on the sea. We there him lost; Whence, driven before the winds, he is arrived Here where his daughter dwells; and on this coast Suppose him now at anchor. The city strived God Neptune’s annual feast to keep: from whence Lysimachus our Tyrian ship espies, His banners sable, trimm’d with rich expense; And to him in his barge with fervour hies. In your supposing once more put your sight Of heavy Pericles; think this his bark: Where what is done in action, more, if might, Shall be discover’d; please you, sit and hark.   [_Exit._]
 SCENE I. On board Pericles’ ship, off Mytilene. A close pavilion on deck, with a curtain before it; Pericles within it, reclined on a couch. A barge lying beside the Tyrian vessel.   Enter two Sailors, one belonging to the Tyrian vessel, the other to  the barge; to them Helicanus.  TYRIAN SAILOR. [_To the Sailor of Mytilene._] Where is lord Helicanus? He can resolve you. O, here he is. Sir, there’s a barge put off from Mytilene, And in it is Lysimachus the governor, Who craves to come aboard. What is your will?  HELICANUS. That he have his. Call up some gentlemen.  TYRIAN SAILOR. Ho, gentlemen! my lord calls.   Enter two or three Gentlemen.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Doth your lordship call?  HELICANUS. Gentlemen, there is some of worth would come aboard; I pray ye, greet them fairly.   [_The Gentlemen and the two Sailors descend and go on board the  barge._]   Enter, from thence, Lysimachus and Lords; with the Gentlemen and the  two Sailors.  TYRIAN SAILOR. Sir, This is the man that can, in aught you would, Resolve you.  LYSIMACHUS. Hail, reverend sir! the gods preserve you!  HELICANUS. And you, sir, to outlive the age I am, And die as I would do.  LYSIMACHUS. You wish me well. Being on shore, honouring of Neptune’s triumphs, Seeing this goodly vessel ride before us, I made to it, to know of whence you are.  HELICANUS. First, what is your place?  LYSIMACHUS. I am the governor of this place you lie before.  HELICANUS. Sir, our vessel is of Tyre, in it the king; A man who for this three months hath not spoken To anyone, nor taken sustenance But to prorogue his grief.  LYSIMACHUS. Upon what ground is his distemperature?  HELICANUS. ’Twould be too tedious to repeat; But the main grief springs from the loss Of a beloved daughter and a wife.  LYSIMACHUS. May we not see him?  HELICANUS. You may; But bootless is your sight: he will not speak To any.  LYSIMACHUS. Yet let me obtain my wish.  HELICANUS. Behold him. [_Pericles discovered._] This was a goodly person. Till the disaster that, one mortal night, Drove him to this.  LYSIMACHUS. Sir king, all hail! The gods preserve you! Hail, royal sir!  HELICANUS. It is in vain; he will not speak to you.  FIRST LORD. Sir, we have a maid in Mytilene, I durst wager, Would win some words of him.  LYSIMACHUS. ’Tis well bethought. She questionless with her sweet harmony And other chosen attractions, would allure, And make a battery through his deafen’d parts, Which now are midway stopp’d: She is all happy as the fairest of all, And, with her fellow maids, is now upon The leafy shelter that abuts against The island’s side.   [_Whispers a Lord who goes off in the barge of Lysimachus._]  HELICANUS. Sure, all’s effectless; yet nothing we’ll omit That bears recovery’s name. But, since your kindness We have stretch’d thus far, let us beseech you That for our gold we may provision have, Wherein we are not destitute for want, But weary for the staleness.  LYSIMACHUS. O, sir, a courtesy Which if we should deny, the most just gods For every graff would send a caterpillar, And so inflict our province. Yet once more Let me entreat to know at large the cause Of your king’s sorrow.  HELICANUS. Sit, sir, I will recount it to you: But, see, I am prevented.   Re-enter from the barge, Lord with Marina and a young Lady.  LYSIMACHUS. O, here is the lady that I sent for. Welcome, fair one! Is’t not a goodly presence?  HELICANUS. She’s a gallant lady.  LYSIMACHUS. She’s such a one, that, were I well assured Came of a gentle kind and noble stock, I’d wish no better choice, and think me rarely wed. Fair one, all goodness that consists in bounty Expect even here, where is a kingly patient: If that thy prosperous and artificial feat Can draw him but to answer thee in aught, Thy sacred physic shall receive such pay As thy desires can wish.  MARINA. Sir, I will use My utmost skill in his recovery, provided That none but I and my companion maid Be suffer’d to come near him.  LYSIMACHUS. Come, let us leave her, And the gods make her prosperous!   [_Marina sings._]  LYSIMACHUS. Mark’d he your music?  MARINA. No, nor look’d on us.  LYSIMACHUS. See, she will speak to him.  MARINA. Hail, sir! My lord, lend ear.  PERICLES. Hum, ha!  MARINA. I am a maid, My lord, that ne’er before invited eyes, But have been gazed on like a comet: she speaks, My lord, that, may be, hath endured a grief Might equal yours, if both were justly weigh’d. Though wayward Fortune did malign my state, My derivation was from ancestors Who stood equivalent with mighty kings: But time hath rooted out my parentage, And to the world and awkward casualties Bound me in servitude. [_Aside._] I will desist; But there is something glows upon my cheek, And whispers in mine ear ‘Go not till he speak.’  PERICLES. My fortunes—parentage—good parentage— To equal mine!—was it not thus? what say you?  MARINA. I said, my lord, if you did know my parentage, You would not do me violence.  PERICLES. I do think so. Pray you, turn your eyes upon me. You are like something that—what country-woman? Here of these shores?  MARINA. No, nor of any shores: Yet I was mortally brought forth, and am No other than I appear.  PERICLES. I am great with woe, and shall deliver weeping. My dearest wife was like this maid, and such a one My daughter might have been: my queen’s square brows; Her stature to an inch; as wand-like straight; As silver-voiced; her eyes as jewel-like And cased as richly; in pace another Juno; Who starves the ears she feeds, and makes them hungry, The more she gives them speech. Where do you live?  MARINA. Where I am but a stranger: from the deck You may discern the place.  PERICLES. Where were you bred? And how achieved you these endowments, which You make more rich to owe?  MARINA. If I should tell my history, it would seem Like lies disdain’d in the reporting.  PERICLES. Prithee, speak: Falseness cannot come from thee; for thou look’st Modest as Justice, and thou seem’st a palace For the crown’d Truth to dwell in: I will believe thee, And make my senses credit thy relation To points that seem impossible; for thou look’st Like one I loved indeed. What were thy friends? Didst thou not say, when I did push thee back— Which was when I perceived thee—that thou cam’st From good descending?  MARINA. So indeed I did.  PERICLES. Report thy parentage. I think thou said’st Thou hadst been toss’d from wrong to injury, And that thou thought’st thy griefs might equal mine, If both were open’d.  MARINA. Some such thing, I said, and said no more but what my thoughts Did warrant me was likely.  PERICLES. Tell thy story; If thine consider’d prove the thousand part Of my endurance, thou art a man, and I Have suffer’d like a girl: yet thou dost look Like Patience gazing on kings’ graves, and smiling Extremity out of act. What were thy friends? How lost thou them? Thy name, my most kind virgin? Recount, I do beseech thee: come, sit by me.  MARINA. My name is Marina.  PERICLES. O, I am mock’d, And thou by some incensed god sent hither To make the world to laugh at me.  MARINA. Patience, good sir, Or here I’ll cease.  PERICLES. Nay, I’ll be patient. Thou little know’st how thou dost startle me, To call thyself Marina.  MARINA. The name Was given me by one that had some power, My father, and a king.  PERICLES. How! a king’s daughter? And call’d Marina?  MARINA. You said you would believe me; But, not to be a troubler of your peace, I will end here.  PERICLES. But are you flesh and blood? Have you a working pulse? and are no fairy? Motion! Well; speak on. Where were you born? And wherefore call’d Marina?  MARINA. Call’d Marina For I was born at sea.  PERICLES. At sea! What mother?  MARINA. My mother was the daughter of a king; Who died the minute I was born, As my good nurse Lychorida hath oft Deliver’d weeping.  PERICLES. O, stop there a little! [_Aside._] This is the rarest dream that e’er dull sleep Did mock sad fools withal: this cannot be: My daughter, buried. Well, where were you bred? I’ll hear you more, to the bottom of your story, And never interrupt you.  MARINA. You scorn: believe me, ’twere best I did give o’er.  PERICLES. I will believe you by the syllable Of what you shall deliver. Yet, give me leave: How came you in these parts? Where were you bred?  MARINA. The king my father did in Tarsus leave me; Till cruel Cleon, with his wicked wife, Did seek to murder me: and having woo’d A villain to attempt it, who having drawn to do’t, A crew of pirates came and rescued me; Brought me to Mytilene. But, good sir. Whither will you have me? Why do you weep? It may be, You think me an impostor: no, good faith; I am the daughter to King Pericles, If good King Pericles be.  PERICLES. Ho, Helicanus!   Enter Helicanus and Lysimachus.  HELICANUS. Calls my lord?  PERICLES. Thou art a grave and noble counsellor, Most wise in general: tell me, if thou canst, What this maid is, or what is like to be, That thus hath made me weep.  HELICANUS. I know not, But here is the regent, sir, of Mytilene Speaks nobly of her.  LYSIMACHUS. She would never tell Her parentage; being demanded that, She would sit still and weep.  PERICLES. O Helicanus, strike me, honour’d sir; Give me a gash, put me to present pain; Lest this great sea of joys rushing upon me O’erbear the shores of my mortality, And drown me with their sweetness. [_To Marina_] O, come hither, Thou that beget’st him that did thee beget; Thou that wast born at sea, buried at Tarsus, And found at sea again! O Helicanus, Down on thy knees, thank the holy gods as loud As thunder threatens us: this is Marina. What was thy mother’s name? tell me but that, For truth can never be confirm’d enough, Though doubts did ever sleep.  MARINA. First, sir, I pray, what is your title?  PERICLES. I am Pericles of Tyre: but tell me now My drown’d queen’s name, as in the rest you said Thou hast been godlike perfect, The heir of kingdoms and another life To Pericles thy father.  MARINA. Is it no more to be your daughter than To say my mother’s name was Thaisa? Thaisa was my mother, who did end The minute I began.  PERICLES. Now, blessing on thee! rise; thou art my child. Give me fresh garments. Mine own, Helicanus; She is not dead at Tarsus, as she should have been, By savage Cleon: she shall tell thee all; When thou shalt kneel, and justify in knowledge She is thy very princess. Who is this?  HELICANUS. Sir, ’tis the governor of Mytilene, Who, hearing of your melancholy state, Did come to see you.  PERICLES. I embrace you. Give me my robes. I am wild in my beholding. O heavens bless my girl! But, hark, what music? Tell Helicanus, my Marina, tell him O’er, point by point, for yet he seems to doubt, How sure you are my daughter. But, what music?  HELICANUS. My lord, I hear none.  PERICLES. None! The music of the spheres! List, my Marina.  LYSIMACHUS. It is not good to cross him; give him way.  PERICLES. Rarest sounds! Do ye not hear?  LYSIMACHUS. Music, my lord? I hear.   [_Music._]  PERICLES. Most heavenly music! It nips me unto listening, and thick slumber Hangs upon mine eyes: let me rest.   [_Sleeps._]  LYSIMACHUS. A pillow for his head: So, leave him all. Well, my companion friends, If this but answer to my just belief, I’ll well remember you.   [_Exeunt all but Pericles._]   Diana appears to Pericles as in a vision.  DIANA. My temple stands in Ephesus: hie thee thither, And do upon mine altar sacrifice. There, when my maiden priests are met together, Before the people all, Reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife: To mourn thy crosses, with thy daughter’s, call And give them repetition to the life. Or perform my bidding, or thou livest in woe: Do it, and happy; by my silver bow! Awake and tell thy dream.   [_Disappears._]  PERICLES. Celestial Dian, goddess argentine, I will obey thee. Helicanus!   Re-enter Helicanus, Lysimachus and Marina.  HELICANUS. Sir?  PERICLES. My purpose was for Tarsus, there to strike The inhospitable Cleon; but I am For other service first: toward Ephesus Turn our blown sails; eftsoons I’ll tell thee why. [_To Lysimachus._] Shall we refresh us, sir, upon your shore, And give you gold for such provision As our intents will need?  LYSIMACHUS. Sir, with all my heart, And when you come ashore I have another suit.  PERICLES. You shall prevail, were it to woo my daughter; For it seems you have been noble towards her.  LYSIMACHUS. Sir, lend me your arm.  PERICLES. Come, my Marina.   [_Exeunt._]
 SCENE II.   Enter Gower before the temple of Diana at Ephesus.  GOWER. Now our sands are almost run; More a little, and then dumb. This, my last boon, give me, For such kindness must relieve me, That you aptly will suppose What pageantry, what feats, what shows, What minstrelsy, and pretty din, The regent made in Mytilene To greet the king. So he thrived, That he is promised to be wived To fair Marina; but in no wise Till he had done his sacrifice, As Dian bade: whereto being bound, The interim, pray you, all confound. In feather’d briefness sails are fill’d, And wishes fall out as they’re will’d. At Ephesus, the temple see, Our king and all his company. That he can hither come so soon, Is by your fancy’s thankful doom.   [_Exit._]
 SCENE III. The temple of Diana at Ephesus; Thaisa standing near the altar, as high priestess; a number of Virgins on each side; Cerimon and other inhabitants of Ephesus attending.   Enter Pericles with his train; Lysimachus, Helicanus, Marina and a  Lady.  PERICLES. Hail, Dian! to perform thy just command, I here confess myself the King of Tyre; Who, frighted from my country, did wed At Pentapolis the fair Thaisa. At sea in childbed died she, but brought forth A maid child call’d Marina; whom, O goddess, Wears yet thy silver livery. She at Tarsus Was nursed with Cleon; who at fourteen years He sought to murder: but her better stars Brought her to Mytilene; ’gainst whose shore Riding, her fortunes brought the maid aboard us, Where by her own most clear remembrance, she Made known herself my daughter.  THAISA. Voice and favour! You are, you are—O royal Pericles!   [_Faints._]  PERICLES. What means the nun? She dies! help, gentlemen!  CERIMON. Noble sir, If you have told Diana’s altar true, This is your wife.  PERICLES. Reverend appearer, no; I threw her overboard with these very arms.  CERIMON. Upon this coast, I warrant you.  PERICLES. ’Tis most certain.  CERIMON. Look to the lady; O, she’s but o’er-joy’d. Early in blustering morn this lady was Thrown upon this shore. I oped the coffin, Found there rich jewels; recover’d her, and placed her Here in Diana’s temple.  PERICLES. May we see them?  CERIMON. Great sir, they shall be brought you to my house, Whither I invite you. Look, Thaisa is Recovered.  THAISA. O, let me look! If he be none of mine, my sanctity Will to my sense bend no licentious ear, But curb it, spite of seeing. O, my lord, Are you not Pericles? Like him you spake, Like him you are: did you not name a tempest, A birth, and death?  PERICLES. The voice of dead Thaisa!  THAISA. That Thaisa am I, supposed dead And drown’d.  PERICLES. Immortal Dian!  THAISA. Now I know you better, When we with tears parted Pentapolis, The king my father gave you such a ring.   [_Shows a ring._]  PERICLES. This, this: no more, you gods! your present kindness Makes my past miseries sports: you shall do well, That on the touching of her lips I may Melt and no more be seen. O, come, be buried A second time within these arms.  MARINA. My heart Leaps to be gone into my mother’s bosom.   [_Kneels to Thaisa._]  PERICLES. Look, who kneels here! Flesh of thy flesh, Thaisa; Thy burden at the sea, and call’d Marina For she was yielded there.  THAISA. Blest, and mine own!  HELICANUS. Hail, madam, and my queen!  THAISA. I know you not.  PERICLES. You have heard me say, when I did fly from Tyre, I left behind an ancient substitute: Can you remember what I call’d the man? I have named him oft.  THAISA. ’Twas Helicanus then.  PERICLES. Still confirmation: Embrace him, dear Thaisa; this is he. Now do I long to hear how you were found: How possibly preserved; and who to thank, Besides the gods, for this great miracle.  THAISA. Lord Cerimon, my lord; this man, Through whom the gods have shown their power; that can From first to last resolve you.  PERICLES. Reverend sir, The gods can have no mortal officer More like a god than you. Will you deliver How this dead queen relives?  CERIMON. I will, my lord. Beseech you, first go with me to my house, Where shall be shown you all was found with her; How she came placed here in the temple; No needful thing omitted.  PERICLES. Pure Dian, bless thee for thy vision! I Will offer night-oblations to thee. Thaisa, This prince, the fair betrothed of your daughter, Shall marry her at Pentapolis. And now this ornament Makes me look dismal will I clip to form; And what this fourteen years no razor touch’d To grace thy marriage-day, I’ll beautify.  THAISA. Lord Cerimon hath letters of good credit, sir, My father’s dead.  PERICLES. Heavens make a star of him! Yet there, my queen, We’ll celebrate their nuptials, and ourselves Will in that kingdom spend our following days: Our son and daughter shall in Tyrus reign. Lord Cerimon, we do our longing stay To hear the rest untold. Sir, lead’s the way.   [_Exeunt._]   Enter Gower.  GOWER. In Antiochus and his daughter you have heard Of monstrous lust the due and just reward: In Pericles, his queen and daughter seen, Although assail’d with Fortune fierce and keen, Virtue preserved from fell destruction’s blast, Led on by heaven, and crown’d with joy at last. In Helicanus may you well descry A figure of truth, of faith, of loyalty: In reverend Cerimon there well appears The worth that learned charity aye wears: For wicked Cleon and his wife, when fame Had spread their cursed deed, the honour’d name Of Pericles, to rage the city turn, That him and his they in his palace burn. The gods for murder seemed so content To punish, although not done, but meant. So on your patience evermore attending, New joy wait on you! Here our play has ending.   [_Exit._]

Gaunt on a couch; the Duke of York and Others standing by him.  GAUNT. Will the King come, that I may breathe my last In wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth?  YORK. Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath, For all in vain comes counsel to his ear.  GAUNT. O, but they say the tongues of dying men Enforce attention like deep harmony. Where words are scarce, they are seldom spent in vain, For they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain. He that no more must say is listened more Than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose. More are men’s ends marked than their lives before. The setting sun and music at the close, As the last taste of sweets, is sweetest last, Writ in remembrance more than things long past. Though Richard my life’s counsel would not hear, My death’s sad tale may yet undeaf his ear.  YORK. No, it is stopped with other flattering sounds, As praises, of whose state the wise are fond; Lascivious metres, to whose venom sound The open ear of youth doth always listen; Report of fashions in proud Italy, Whose manners still our tardy-apish nation Limps after in base imitation. Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity— So it be new, there’s no respect how vile— That is not quickly buzzed into his ears? Then all too late comes counsel to be heard, Where will doth mutiny with wit’s regard. Direct not him whose way himself will choose. ’Tis breath thou lack’st, and that breath wilt thou lose.  GAUNT. Methinks I am a prophet new inspired, And thus expiring do foretell of him: His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last, For violent fires soon burn out themselves; Small showers last long, but sudden storms are short; He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes; With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder. Light vanity, insatiate cormorant, Consuming means, soon preys upon itself. This royal throne of kings, this sceptered isle, This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars, This other Eden, demi-paradise, This fortress built by Nature for herself Against infection and the hand of war, This happy breed of men, this little world, This precious stone set in the silver sea, Which serves it in the office of a wall Or as a moat defensive to a house, Against the envy of less happier lands; This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England, This nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings, Feared by their breed, and famous by their birth, Renowned for their deeds as far from home, For Christian service and true chivalry, As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry Of the world’s ransom, blessed Mary’s Son, This land of such dear souls, this dear dear land, Dear for her reputation through the world, Is now leased out—I die pronouncing it— Like to a tenement or pelting farm. England, bound in with the triumphant sea, Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege Of wat’ry Neptune, is now bound in with shame, With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds That England that was wont to conquer others Hath made a shameful conquest of itself. Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life, How happy then were my ensuing death!   Enter King Richard and Queen; Aumerle, Bushy, Green, Bagot, Ross and  Willoughby.  YORK. The King is come. Deal mildly with his youth, For young hot colts, being raged, do rage the more.  QUEEN. How fares our noble uncle, Lancaster?  KING RICHARD. What comfort, man? How is’t with aged Gaunt?  GAUNT. O, how that name befits my composition! Old Gaunt indeed, and gaunt in being old. Within me grief hath kept a tedious fast, And who abstains from meat that is not gaunt? For sleeping England long time have I watched; Watching breeds leanness, leanness is all gaunt. The pleasure that some fathers feed upon Is my strict fast—I mean my children’s looks, And therein fasting, hast thou made me gaunt. Gaunt am I for the grave, gaunt as a grave, Whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones.  KING RICHARD. Can sick men play so nicely with their names?  GAUNT. No, misery makes sport to mock itself. Since thou dost seek to kill my name in me, I mock my name, great king, to flatter thee.  KING RICHARD. Should dying men flatter with those that live?  GAUNT. No, no, men living flatter those that die.  KING RICHARD. Thou, now a-dying, sayest thou flatterest me.  GAUNT. O, no, thou diest, though I the sicker be.  KING RICHARD. I am in health, I breathe, and see thee ill.  GAUNT. Now, He that made me knows I see thee ill, Ill in myself to see, and in thee seeing ill. Thy death-bed is no lesser than thy land, Wherein thou liest in reputation sick; And thou, too careless patient as thou art, Committ’st thy anointed body to the cure Of those physicians that first wounded thee. A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown, Whose compass is no bigger than thy head; And yet, encaged in so small a verge, The waste is no whit lesser than thy land. O, had thy grandsire with a prophet’s eye Seen how his son’s son should destroy his sons, From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame, Deposing thee before thou wert possessed, Which art possessed now to depose thyself. Why, cousin, wert thou regent of the world, It were a shame to let this land by lease; But for thy world enjoying but this land, Is it not more than shame to shame it so? Landlord of England art thou now, not king. Thy state of law is bondslave to the law, And thou—  KING RICHARD. A lunatic lean-witted fool, Presuming on an ague’s privilege, Darest with thy frozen admonition Make pale our cheek, chasing the royal blood With fury from his native residence. Now, by my seat’s right royal majesty, Wert thou not brother to great Edward’s son, This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head Should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders.  GAUNT. O! spare me not, my brother Edward’s son, For that I was his father Edward’s son. That blood already, like the pelican, Hast thou tapped out, and drunkenly caroused. My brother Gloucester, plain well-meaning soul, Whom fair befall in heaven ’mongst happy souls!— May be a precedent and witness good That thou respect’st not spilling Edward’s blood. Join with the present sickness that I have, And thy unkindness be like crooked age To crop at once a too-long withered flower. Live in thy shame, but die not shame with thee! These words hereafter thy tormentors be! Convey me to my bed, then to my grave. Love they to live that love and honour have.   [_Exit, borne off by his Attendants._]  KING RICHARD. And let them die that age and sullens have, For both hast thou, and both become the grave.  YORK. I do beseech your Majesty, impute his words To wayward sickliness and age in him. He loves you, on my life, and holds you dear As Harry, Duke of Hereford, were he here.  KING RICHARD. Right, you say true: as Hereford’s love, so his; As theirs, so mine; and all be as it is.   Enter Northumberland.  NORTHUMBERLAND. My liege, old Gaunt commends him to your Majesty.  KING RICHARD. What says he?  NORTHUMBERLAND. Nay, nothing; all is said. His tongue is now a stringless instrument; Words, life, and all, old Lancaster hath spent.  YORK. Be York the next that must be bankrupt so! Though death be poor, it ends a mortal woe.  KING RICHARD. The ripest fruit first falls, and so doth he. His time is spent; our pilgrimage must be. So much for that. Now for our Irish wars: We must supplant those rough rug-headed kerns, Which live like venom where no venom else But only they have privilege to live. And, for these great affairs do ask some charge, Towards our assistance we do seize to us The plate, coin, revenues, and moveables Whereof our uncle Gaunt did stand possessed.  YORK. How long shall I be patient? Ah, how long Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong? Not Gloucester’s death, nor Hereford’s banishment, Nor Gaunt’s rebukes, nor England’s private wrongs, Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke About his marriage, nor my own disgrace, Have ever made me sour my patient cheek, Or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign’s face. I am the last of noble Edward’s sons, Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first. In war was never lion raged more fierce, In peace was never gentle lamb more mild, Than was that young and princely gentleman. His face thou hast, for even so looked he, Accomplished with the number of thy hours; But when he frowned, it was against the French And not against his friends. His noble hand Did win what he did spend, and spent not that Which his triumphant father’s hand had won. His hands were guilty of no kindred’s blood, But bloody with the enemies of his kin. O Richard! York is too far gone with grief, Or else he never would compare between.  KING RICHARD. Why, uncle, what’s the matter?  YORK. O my liege. Pardon me, if you please; if not, I, pleased Not to be pardoned, am content withal. Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands The royalties and rights of banished Hereford? Is not Gaunt dead? And doth not Hereford live? Was not Gaunt just? And is not Harry true? Did not the one deserve to have an heir? Is not his heir a well-deserving son? Take Hereford’s rights away, and take from Time His charters and his customary rights; Let not tomorrow then ensue today; Be not thyself; for how art thou a king But by fair sequence and succession? Now, afore God—God forbid I say true!— If you do wrongfully seize Hereford’s rights, Call in the letters patents that he hath By his attorneys-general to sue His livery, and deny his offered homage, You pluck a thousand dangers on your head, You lose a thousand well-disposed hearts, And prick my tender patience to those thoughts Which honour and allegiance cannot think.  KING RICHARD. Think what you will, we seize into our hands His plate, his goods, his money, and his lands.  YORK. I’ll not be by the while. My liege, farewell. What will ensue hereof there’s none can tell; But by bad courses may be understood That their events can never fall out good.   [_Exit._]  KING RICHARD. Go, Bushy, to the Earl of Wiltshire straight. Bid him repair to us to Ely House To see this business. Tomorrow next We will for Ireland, and ’tis time, I trow. And we create, in absence of ourself, Our Uncle York Lord Governor of England, For he is just, and always loved us well. Come on, our queen. Tomorrow must we part; Be merry, for our time of stay is short.   [_Exeunt King, Queen, Bushy, Aumerle, Green and Bagot._]  NORTHUMBERLAND. Well, lords, the Duke of Lancaster is dead.  ROSS. And living too, for now his son is Duke.  WILLOUGHBY. Barely in title, not in revenues.  NORTHUMBERLAND. Richly in both, if justice had her right.  ROSS. My heart is great, but it must break with silence Ere’t be disburdened with a liberal tongue.  NORTHUMBERLAND. Nay, speak thy mind, and let him ne’er speak more That speaks thy words again to do thee harm!  WILLOUGHBY. Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of Hereford? If it be so, out with it boldly, man. Quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him.  ROSS. No good at all that I can do for him, Unless you call it good to pity him, Bereft and gelded of his patrimony.  NORTHUMBERLAND. Now, afore God, ’tis shame such wrongs are borne In him, a royal prince, and many moe Of noble blood in this declining land. The King is not himself, but basely led By flatterers; and what they will inform, Merely in hate ’gainst any of us all, That will the King severely prosecute ’Gainst us, our lives, our children, and our heirs.  ROSS. The commons hath he pilled with grievous taxes, And quite lost their hearts. The nobles hath he fined For ancient quarrels and quite lost their hearts.  WILLOUGHBY. And daily new exactions are devised, As blanks, benevolences, and I wot not what. But what, i’ God’s name, doth become of this?  NORTHUMBERLAND. Wars hath not wasted it, for warred he hath not, But basely yielded upon compromise That which his ancestors achieved with blows. More hath he spent in peace than they in wars.  ROSS. The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm.  WILLOUGHBY. The King’s grown bankrupt like a broken man.  NORTHUMBERLAND. Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him.  ROSS. He hath not money for these Irish wars, His burdenous taxations notwithstanding, But by the robbing of the banished Duke.  NORTHUMBERLAND. His noble kinsman. Most degenerate king! But, lords, we hear this fearful tempest sing, Yet seek no shelter to avoid the storm; We see the wind sit sore upon our sails, And yet we strike not, but securely perish.  ROSS. We see the very wrack that we must suffer; And unavoided is the danger now For suffering so the causes of our wrack.  NORTHUMBERLAND. Not so. Even through the hollow eyes of death I spy life peering; but I dare not say How near the tidings of our comfort is.  WILLOUGHBY. Nay, let us share thy thoughts as thou dost ours.  ROSS. Be confident to speak, Northumberland. We three are but thyself, and, speaking so, Thy words are but as thoughts. Therefore be bold.  NORTHUMBERLAND. Then thus: I have from Le Port Blanc, a bay In Brittany, received intelligence That Harry Duke of Hereford, Rainold Lord Cobham, That late broke from the Duke of Exeter, His brother, Archbishop late of Canterbury, Sir Thomas Erpingham, Sir John Ramston, Sir John Norbery, Sir Robert Waterton, and Francis Coint, All these well furnished by the Duke of Brittany With eight tall ships, three thousand men of war, Are making hither with all due expedience, And shortly mean to touch our northern shore. Perhaps they had ere this, but that they stay The first departing of the king for Ireland. If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke, Imp out our drooping country’s broken wing, Redeem from broking pawn the blemished crown, Wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre’s gilt, And make high majesty look like itself, Away with me in post to Ravenspurgh. But if you faint, as fearing to do so, Stay and be secret, and myself will go.  ROSS. To horse, to horse! Urge doubts to them that fear.  WILLOUGHBY. Hold out my horse, and I will first be there.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. The Same. A Room in the Castle.   Enter Queen, Bushy and Bagot.  BUSHY. Madam, your Majesty is too much sad. You promised, when you parted with the King, To lay aside life-harming heaviness And entertain a cheerful disposition.  QUEEN. To please the King I did; to please myself I cannot do it. Yet I know no cause Why I should welcome such a guest as grief, Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest As my sweet Richard. Yet again methinks, Some unborn sorrow, ripe in Fortune’s womb, Is coming towards me, and my inward soul With nothing trembles. At something it grieves More than with parting from my lord the King.  BUSHY. Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows, Which shows like grief itself, but is not so; For sorrow’s eye, glazed with blinding tears, Divides one thing entire to many objects, Like perspectives which, rightly gazed upon, Show nothing but confusion; eyed awry, Distinguish form. So your sweet Majesty, Looking awry upon your lord’s departure, Find shapes of grief more than himself to wail, Which, looked on as it is, is naught but shadows Of what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious Queen, More than your lord’s departure weep not. More is not seen, Or if it be, ’tis with false sorrow’s eye, Which for things true weeps things imaginary.  QUEEN. It may be so; but yet my inward soul Persuades me it is otherwise. Howe’er it be, I cannot but be sad—so heavy sad As thought, in thinking, on no thought I think, Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.  BUSHY. ’Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.  QUEEN. ’Tis nothing less. Conceit is still derived From some forefather grief. Mine is not so, For nothing hath begot my something grief, Or something hath the nothing that I grieve. ’Tis in reversion that I do possess, But what it is, that is not yet known what, I cannot name. ’Tis nameless woe, I wot.   Enter Green.  GREEN. God save your majesty! And well met, gentlemen. I hope the King is not yet shipped for Ireland.  QUEEN. Why hop’st thou so? ’Tis better hope he is, For his designs crave haste, his haste good hope. Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipped?  GREEN. That he, our hope, might have retired his power, And driven into despair an enemy’s hope Who strongly hath set footing in this land. The banished Bolingbroke repeals himself, And with uplifted arms is safe arrived At Ravenspurgh.  QUEEN. Now God in heaven forbid!  GREEN. Ah, madam, ’tis too true; and that is worse, The Lord Northumberland, his son young Harry Percy, The Lords of Ross, Beaumond, and Willoughby, With all their powerful friends, are fled to him.  BUSHY. Why have you not proclaimed Northumberland And all the rest revolted faction traitors?  GREEN. We have, whereupon the Earl of Worcester Hath broken his staff, resigned his stewardship, And all the household servants fled with him To Bolingbroke.  QUEEN. So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe, And Bolingbroke my sorrow’s dismal heir. Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy, And I, a gasping new-delivered mother, Have woe to woe, sorrow to sorrow joined.  BUSHY. Despair not, madam.  QUEEN. Who shall hinder me? I will despair and be at enmity With cozening hope. He is a flatterer, A parasite, a keeper-back of death, Who gently would dissolve the bands of life, Which false hope lingers in extremity.   Enter York.  GREEN. Here comes the Duke of York.  QUEEN. With signs of war about his aged neck. O! full of careful business are his looks! Uncle, for God’s sake, speak comfortable words.  YORK. Should I do so, I should belie my thoughts. Comfort’s in heaven, and we are on the earth, Where nothing lives but crosses, cares, and grief. Your husband, he is gone to save far off, Whilst others come to make him lose at home. Here am I left to underprop his land, Who, weak with age, cannot support myself. Now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made; Now shall he try his friends that flattered him.   Enter a Servingman.  SERVINGMAN. My lord, your son was gone before I came.  YORK. He was? Why, so! Go all which way it will! The nobles they are fled, the commons they are cold And will, I fear, revolt on Hereford’s side. Sirrah, get thee to Plashy, to my sister Gloucester; Bid her send me presently a thousand pound. Hold, take my ring.  SERVINGMAN. My lord, I had forgot to tell your lordship: Today, as I came by, I called there— But I shall grieve you to report the rest.  YORK. What is’t, knave?  SERVINGMAN. An hour before I came, the Duchess died.  YORK. God for his mercy, what a tide of woes Comes rushing on this woeful land at once! I know not what to do. I would to God, So my untruth had not provoked him to it, The King had cut off my head with my brother’s. What, are there no posts dispatched for Ireland? How shall we do for money for these wars? Come, sister—cousin, I would say, pray, pardon me. Go, fellow, get thee home; provide some carts And bring away the armour that is there.   [_Exit Servingman._]  Gentlemen, will you go muster men? If I know how or which way to order these affairs Thus disorderly thrust into my hands, Never believe me. Both are my kinsmen. Th’ one is my sovereign, whom both my oath And duty bids defend; th’ other again Is my kinsman, whom the King hath wronged, Whom conscience and my kindred bids to right. Well, somewhat we must do. Come, cousin, I’ll dispose of you. Gentlemen, go muster up your men, And meet me presently at Berkeley Castle. I should to Plashy too, But time will not permit. All is uneven, And everything is left at six and seven.   [_Exeunt York and Queen._]  BUSHY. The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland, But none returns. For us to levy power Proportionable to the enemy Is all unpossible.  GREEN. Besides, our nearness to the King in love Is near the hate of those love not the King.  BAGOT. And that is the wavering commons, for their love Lies in their purses; and whoso empties them, By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate.  BUSHY. Wherein the King stands generally condemned.  BAGOT. If judgment lie in them, then so do we, Because we ever have been near the King.  GREEN. Well, I will for refuge straight to Bristol Castle. The Earl of Wiltshire is already there.  BUSHY. Thither will I with you, for little office Will the hateful commons perform for us, Except like curs to tear us all to pieces. Will you go along with us?  BAGOT. No, I will to Ireland to his Majesty. Farewell. If heart’s presages be not vain, We three here part that ne’er shall meet again.  BUSHY. That’s as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke.  GREEN. Alas, poor Duke! The task he undertakes Is numb’ring sands and drinking oceans dry. Where one on his side fights, thousands will fly. Farewell at once, for once, for all, and ever.  BUSHY. Well, we may meet again.  BAGOT. I fear me, never.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. The Wolds in Gloucestershire.   Enter Bolingbroke and Northumberland with Forces.  BOLINGBROKE. How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now?  NORTHUMBERLAND. Believe me, noble lord, I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire. These high wild hills and rough uneven ways Draws out our miles and makes them wearisome. And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar, Making the hard way sweet and delectable. But I bethink me what a weary way From Ravenspurgh to Cotshall will be found In Ross and Willoughby, wanting your company, Which, I protest, hath very much beguiled The tediousness and process of my travel. But theirs is sweetened with the hope to have The present benefit which I possess; And hope to joy is little less in joy Than hope enjoyed. By this the weary lords Shall make their way seem short as mine hath done By sight of what I have, your noble company.  BOLINGBROKE. Of much less value is my company Than your good words. But who comes here?   Enter Harry Percy.  NORTHUMBERLAND. It is my son, young Harry Percy, Sent from my brother Worcester, whencesoever. Harry, how fares your uncle?  PERCY. I had thought, my lord, to have learned his health of you.  NORTHUMBERLAND. Why, is he not with the Queen?  PERCY. No, my good lord. He hath forsook the court, Broken his staff of office, and dispersed The household of the King.  NORTHUMBERLAND. What was his reason? He was not so resolved when last we spake together.  PERCY. Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor. But he, my lord, is gone to Ravenspurgh To offer service to the Duke of Hereford, And sent me over by Berkeley to discover What power the Duke of York had levied there, Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh.  NORTHUMBERLAND. Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy?  PERCY. No, my good lord; for that is not forgot Which ne’er I did remember. To my knowledge, I never in my life did look on him.  NORTHUMBERLAND. Then learn to know him now. This is the Duke.  PERCY. My gracious lord, I tender you my service, Such as it is, being tender, raw, and young, Which elder days shall ripen and confirm To more approved service and desert.  BOLINGBROKE. I thank thee, gentle Percy; and be sure I count myself in nothing else so happy As in a soul rememb’ring my good friends; And as my fortune ripens with thy love, It shall be still thy true love’s recompense. My heart this covenant makes, my hand thus seals it.  NORTHUMBERLAND. How far is it to Berkeley, and what stir Keeps good old York there with his men of war?  PERCY. There stands the castle by yon tuft of trees, Manned with three hundred men, as I have heard. And in it are the Lords of York, Berkeley, and Seymour, None else of name and noble estimate.   Enter Ross and Willoughby.  NORTHUMBERLAND. Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby, Bloody with spurring, fiery-red with haste.  BOLINGBROKE. Welcome, my lords. I wot your love pursues A banished traitor. All my treasury Is yet but unfelt thanks, which, more enriched, Shall be your love and labour’s recompense.  ROSS. Your presence makes us rich, most noble lord.  WILLOUGHBY. And far surmounts our labour to attain it.  BOLINGBROKE. Evermore thanks, the exchequer of the poor; Which, till my infant fortune comes to years, Stands for my bounty. But who comes here?   Enter Berkeley.  NORTHUMBERLAND. It is my Lord of Berkeley, as I guess.  BERKELEY. My Lord of Hereford, my message is to you.  BOLINGBROKE. My lord, my answer is—to “Lancaster”, And I am come to seek that name in England; And I must find that title in your tongue Before I make reply to aught you say.  BERKELEY. Mistake me not, my lord, ’tis not my meaning To rase one title of your honour out. To you, my lord, I come, what lord you will, From the most gracious regent of this land, The Duke of York, to know what pricks you on To take advantage of the absent time, And fright our native peace with self-borne arms.   Enter York, attended.  BOLINGBROKE. I shall not need transport my words by you. Here comes his Grace in person. My noble uncle!   [_Kneels._]  YORK. Show me thy humble heart, and not thy knee, Whose duty is deceivable and false.  BOLINGBROKE. My gracious uncle—  YORK. Tut, tut! Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle. I am no traitor’s uncle, and that word “grace” In an ungracious mouth is but profane. Why have those banished and forbidden legs Dared once to touch a dust of England’s ground? But then more why: why have they dared to march So many miles upon her peaceful bosom, Frighting her pale-faced villages with war And ostentation of despised arms? Com’st thou because the anointed king is hence? Why, foolish boy, the King is left behind, And in my loyal bosom lies his power. Were I but now lord of such hot youth As when brave Gaunt, thy father, and myself Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men, From forth the ranks of many thousand French, O, then how quickly should this arm of mine, Now prisoner to the palsy, chastise thee And minister correction to thy fault!  BOLINGBROKE. My gracious uncle, let me know my fault. On what condition stands it and wherein?  YORK. Even in condition of the worst degree, In gross rebellion and detested treason. Thou art a banished man, and here art come, Before the expiration of thy time, In braving arms against thy sovereign.  BOLINGBROKE. As I was banished, I was banished Hereford; But as I come, I come for Lancaster. And, noble uncle, I beseech your Grace Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye. You are my father, for methinks in you I see old Gaunt alive. O then, my father, Will you permit that I shall stand condemned A wandering vagabond, my rights and royalties Plucked from my arms perforce and given away To upstart unthrifts? Wherefore was I born? If that my cousin king be King in England, It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster. You have a son, Aumerle, my noble cousin. Had you first died and he been thus trod down, He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay. I am denied to sue my livery here, And yet my letters patents give me leave. My father’s goods are all distrained and sold, And these, and all, are all amiss employed. What would you have me do? I am a subject, And challenge law. Attorneys are denied me, And therefore personally I lay my claim To my inheritance of free descent.  NORTHUMBERLAND. The noble Duke hath been too much abused.  ROSS. It stands your Grace upon to do him right.  WILLOUGHBY. Base men by his endowments are made great.  YORK. My lords of England, let me tell you this: I have had feeling of my cousin’s wrongs And laboured all I could to do him right. But in this kind to come, in braving arms, Be his own carver and cut out his way To find out right with wrong, it may not be. And you that do abet him in this kind Cherish rebellion and are rebels all.  NORTHUMBERLAND. The noble Duke hath sworn his coming is But for his own; and for the right of that We all have strongly sworn to give him aid; And let him never see joy that breaks that oath!  YORK. Well, well, I see the issue of these arms. I cannot mend it, I must needs confess, Because my power is weak and all ill-left; But if I could, by Him that gave me life, I would attach you all and make you stoop Unto the sovereign mercy of the King. But since I cannot, be it known unto you I do remain as neuter. So fare you well— Unless you please to enter in the castle And there repose you for this night.  BOLINGBROKE. An offer, uncle, that we will accept; But we must win your Grace to go with us To Bristol Castle, which they say is held By Bushy, Bagot, and their complices, The caterpillars of the commonwealth, Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away.  YORK. It may be I will go with you; but yet I’ll pause, For I am loath to break our country’s laws. Nor friends nor foes, to me welcome you are. Things past redress are now with me past care.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IV. A camp in Wales.   Enter Earl of Salisbury and a Welsh Captain.  CAPTAIN. My Lord of Salisbury, we have stayed ten days And hardly kept our countrymen together, And yet we hear no tidings from the King. Therefore we will disperse ourselves. Farewell.  SALISBURY. Stay yet another day, thou trusty Welshman. The King reposeth all his confidence in thee.  CAPTAIN. ’Tis thought the King is dead. We will not stay. The bay trees in our country are all withered, And meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven; The pale-faced moon looks bloody on the earth, And lean-looked prophets whisper fearful change; Rich men look sad, and ruffians dance and leap, The one in fear to lose what they enjoy, The other to enjoy by rage and war. These signs forerun the death or fall of kings. Farewell. Our countrymen are gone and fled, As well assured Richard their king is dead.   [_Exit._]  SALISBURY. Ah, Richard! With the eyes of heavy mind I see thy glory like a shooting star Fall to the base earth from the firmament. Thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west, Witnessing storms to come, woe, and unrest. Thy friends are fled, to wait upon thy foes, And crossly to thy good all fortune goes.   [_Exit._]
  ACT III  SCENE I. Bristol. Bolingbroke’s camp.
 Enter Bolingbroke, York, Northumberland, Harry Percy, Willoughby,  Ross; Officers behind, with Bushy and Green, prisoners.  BOLINGBROKE. Bring forth these men. Bushy and Green, I will not vex your souls— Since presently your souls must part your bodies— With too much urging your pernicious lives, For ’twere no charity; yet to wash your blood From off my hands, here in the view of men I will unfold some causes of your deaths: You have misled a prince, a royal king, A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments, By you unhappied and disfigured clean. You have in manner with your sinful hours Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him, Broke the possession of a royal bed, And stained the beauty of a fair queen’s cheeks With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs. Myself, a prince by fortune of my birth, Near to the King in blood, and near in love Till you did make him misinterpret me, Have stooped my neck under your injuries And sighed my English breath in foreign clouds, Eating the bitter bread of banishment, Whilst you have fed upon my signories, Disparked my parks and felled my forest woods, From my own windows torn my household coat, Rased out my imprese, leaving me no sign Save men’s opinions and my living blood To show the world I am a gentleman. This and much more, much more than twice all this, Condemns you to the death. See them delivered over To execution and the hand of death.  BUSHY. More welcome is the stroke of death to me Than Bolingbroke to England. Lords, farewell.  GREEN. My comfort is that heaven will take our souls And plague injustice with the pains of hell.  BOLINGBROKE. My Lord Northumberland, see them dispatched.   [_Exeunt Northumberland and Others, with Bushy and Green._]  Uncle, you say the Queen is at your house; For God’s sake, fairly let her be entreated. Tell her I send to her my kind commends; Take special care my greetings be delivered.  YORK. A gentleman of mine I have dispatched With letters of your love to her at large.  BOLINGBROKE. Thanks, gentle uncle. Come, lords, away, To fight with Glendower and his complices. A while to work, and after holiday.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. The coast of Wales. A castle in view.   Flourish: drums and trumpets. Enter King Richard, the Bishop of  Carlisle, Aumerle and soldiers.  KING RICHARD. Barkloughly Castle call they this at hand?  AUMERLE. Yea, my lord. How brooks your Grace the air After your late tossing on the breaking seas?  KING RICHARD. Needs must I like it well. I weep for joy To stand upon my kingdom once again. Dear earth, I do salute thee with my hand, Though rebels wound thee with their horses’ hoofs. As a long-parted mother with her child Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting, So weeping-smiling greet I thee, my earth, And do thee favours with my royal hands. Feed not thy sovereign’s foe, my gentle earth, Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense, But let thy spiders, that suck up thy venom, And heavy-gaited toads lie in their way, Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet Which with usurping steps do trample thee. Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies; And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower, Guard it, I pray thee, with a lurking adder Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch Throw death upon thy sovereign’s enemies. Mock not my senseless conjuration, lords. This earth shall have a feeling, and these stones Prove armed soldiers, ere her native king Shall falter under foul rebellion’s arms.  CARLISLE. Fear not, my lord. That Power that made you king Hath power to keep you king in spite of all. The means that heaven yields must be embraced And not neglected; else if heaven would, And we will not. Heaven’s offer we refuse, The proffered means of succour and redress.  AUMERLE. He means, my lord, that we are too remiss, Whilst Bolingbroke, through our security, Grows strong and great in substance and in power.  KING RICHARD. Discomfortable cousin, know’st thou not That when the searching eye of heaven is hid Behind the globe that lights the lower world, Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen In murders and in outrage boldly here; But when from under this terrestrial ball He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines And darts his light through every guilty hole, Then murders, treasons, and detested sins, The cloak of night being plucked from off their backs, Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves? So when this thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke, Who all this while hath revelled in the night Whilst we were wand’ring with the Antipodes, Shall see us rising in our throne, the east, His treasons will sit blushing in his face, Not able to endure the sight of day, But self-affrighted, tremble at his sin. Not all the water in the rough rude sea Can wash the balm off from an anointed king; The breath of worldly men cannot depose The deputy elected by the Lord. For every man that Bolingbroke hath pressed To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown, God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay A glorious angel. Then, if angels fight, Weak men must fall, for heaven still guards the right.   Enter Salisbury.  Welcome, my lord. How far off lies your power?  SALISBURY. Nor near nor farther off, my gracious lord, Than this weak arm. Discomfort guides my tongue And bids me speak of nothing but despair. One day too late, I fear me, noble lord, Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth. O, call back yesterday, bid time return, And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men! Today, today, unhappy day, too late, O’erthrows thy joys, friends, fortune, and thy state; For all the Welshmen, hearing thou wert dead, Are gone to Bolingbroke, dispersed, and fled.  AUMERLE. Comfort, my liege. Why looks your Grace so pale?  KING RICHARD. But now, the blood of twenty thousand men Did triumph in my face, and they are fled; And till so much blood thither come again Have I not reason to look pale and dead? All souls that will be safe, fly from my side, For time hath set a blot upon my pride.  AUMERLE. Comfort, my liege. Remember who you are.  KING RICHARD. I had forgot myself. Am I not king? Awake, thou coward majesty! thou sleepest! Is not the King’s name twenty thousand names? Arm, arm, my name! A puny subject strikes At thy great glory. Look not to the ground, Ye favourites of a king. Are we not high? High be our thoughts. I know my uncle York Hath power enough to serve our turn. But who comes here?   Enter Sir Stephen Scroop.  SCROOP. More health and happiness betide my liege Than can my care-tuned tongue deliver him.  KING RICHARD. Mine ear is open and my heart prepared. The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold. Say, is my kingdom lost? Why, ’twas my care, And what loss is it to be rid of care? Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we? Greater he shall not be. If he serve God, We’ll serve Him too, and be his fellow so. Revolt our subjects? That we cannot mend. They break their faith to God as well as us. Cry woe, destruction, ruin, loss, decay. The worst is death, and death will have his day.  SCROOP. Glad am I that your highness is so armed To bear the tidings of calamity. Like an unseasonable stormy day Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores As if the world were all dissolved to tears, So high above his limits swells the rage Of Bolingbroke, covering your fearful land With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel. Whitebeards have armed their thin and hairless scalps Against thy majesty; boys with women’s voices Strive to speak big and clap their female joints In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown; Thy very beadsmen learn to bend their bows Of double-fatal yew against thy state; Yea, distaff-women manage rusty bills Against thy seat. Both young and old rebel, And all goes worse than I have power to tell.  KING RICHARD. Too well, too well thou tell’st a tale so ill. Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? Where is Bagot? What is become of Bushy? Where is Green? That they have let the dangerous enemy Measure our confines with such peaceful steps? If we prevail, their heads shall pay for it. I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke.  SCROOP. Peace have they made with him indeed, my lord.  KING RICHARD. O villains, vipers, damned without redemption! Dogs, easily won to fawn on any man! Snakes, in my heart-blood warmed, that sting my heart! Three Judases, each one thrice worse than Judas! Would they make peace? Terrible hell Make war upon their spotted souls for this!  SCROOP. Sweet love, I see, changing his property, Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate. Again uncurse their souls. Their peace is made With heads, and not with hands. Those whom you curse Have felt the worst of death’s destroying wound And lie full low, graved in the hollow ground.  AUMERLE. Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?  SCROOP. Ay, all of them at Bristol lost their heads.  AUMERLE. Where is the Duke my father with his power?  KING RICHARD. No matter where. Of comfort no man speak! Let’s talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs, Make dust our paper, and with rainy eyes Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth. Let’s choose executors and talk of wills. And yet not so, for what can we bequeath Save our deposed bodies to the ground? Our lands, our lives, and all are Bolingbroke’s, And nothing can we call our own but death And that small model of the barren earth Which serves as paste and cover to our bones. For God’s sake let us sit upon the ground And tell sad stories of the death of kings— How some have been deposed, some slain in war, Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed, Some poisoned by their wives, some sleeping killed, All murdered. For within the hollow crown That rounds the mortal temples of a king Keeps Death his court; and there the antic sits, Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp, Allowing him a breath, a little scene, To monarchize, be feared, and kill with looks, Infusing him with self and vain conceit, As if this flesh which walls about our life Were brass impregnable; and, humoured thus, Comes at the last, and with a little pin Bores through his castle wall, and farewell, king! Cover your heads, and mock not flesh and blood With solemn reverence. Throw away respect, Tradition, form, and ceremonious duty, For you have but mistook me all this while. I live with bread like you, feel want, Taste grief, need friends. Subjected thus, How can you say to me I am a king?  CARLISLE. My lord, wise men ne’er sit and wail their woes, But presently prevent the ways to wail. To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength, Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe, And so your follies fight against yourself. Fear and be slain—no worse can come to fight; And fight and die is death destroying death, Where fearing dying pays death servile breath.  AUMERLE. My father hath a power. Enquire of him, And learn to make a body of a limb.  KING RICHARD. Thou chid’st me well. Proud Bolingbroke, I come To change blows with thee for our day of doom. This ague fit of fear is overblown; An easy task it is to win our own. Say, Scroop, where lies our uncle with his power? Speak sweetly, man, although thy looks be sour.  SCROOP. Men judge by the complexion of the sky The state in inclination of the day; So may you by my dull and heavy eye. My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say. I play the torturer by small and small To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken: Your uncle York is joined with Bolingbroke, And all your northern castles yielded up, And all your southern gentlemen in arms Upon his party.  KING RICHARD. Thou hast said enough. [_To Aumerle_.] Beshrew thee, cousin, which didst lead me forth Of that sweet way I was in to despair. What say you now? What comfort have we now? By heaven, I’ll hate him everlastingly That bids me be of comfort any more. Go to Flint Castle. There I’ll pine away; A king, woe’s slave, shall kingly woe obey. That power I have, discharge, and let them go To ear the land that hath some hope to grow, For I have none. Let no man speak again To alter this, for counsel is but vain.  AUMERLE. My liege, one word.  KING RICHARD. He does me double wrong That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue. Discharge my followers. Let them hence away, From Richard’s night to Bolingbroke’s fair day.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. Wales. Before Flint Castle.   Enter, with drum and colours, Bolingbroke and Forces; Northumberland  and Others.  BOLINGBROKE. So that by this intelligence we learn The Welshmen are dispersed, and Salisbury Is gone to meet the King, who lately landed With some few private friends upon this coast.  NORTHUMBERLAND. The news is very fair and good, my lord: Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.  YORK. It would beseem the Lord Northumberland To say “King Richard”. Alack the heavy day When such a sacred king should hide his head!  NORTHUMBERLAND. Your Grace mistakes; only to be brief Left I his title out.  YORK. The time hath been, Would you have been so brief with him, he would Have been so brief with you to shorten you, For taking so the head, your whole head’s length.  BOLINGBROKE. Mistake not, uncle, further than you should.  YORK. Take not, good cousin, further than you should, Lest you mistake. The heavens are o’er our heads.  BOLINGBROKE. I know it, uncle, and oppose not myself Against their will. But who comes here?   Enter Harry Percy.  Welcome, Harry. What, will not this castle yield?  PERCY. The castle royally is manned, my lord, Against thy entrance.  BOLINGBROKE. Royally! Why, it contains no king?  PERCY. Yes, my good lord, It doth contain a king. King Richard lies Within the limits of yon lime and stone, And with him are the Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury, Sir Stephen Scroop, besides a clergyman Of holy reverence—who, I cannot learn.  NORTHUMBERLAND. O, belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle.  BOLINGBROKE. [_To Northumberland_.] Noble lord, Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle; Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley Into his ruined ears, and thus deliver: Henry Bolingbroke On both his knees doth kiss King Richard’s hand And sends allegiance and true faith of heart To his most royal person, hither come Even at his feet to lay my arms and power, Provided that my banishment repealed And lands restored again be freely granted. If not, I’ll use the advantage of my power And lay the summer’s dust with showers of blood Rained from the wounds of slaughtered Englishmen— The which how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke It is such crimson tempest should bedrench The fresh green lap of fair King Richard’s land, My stooping duty tenderly shall show. Go signify as much, while here we march Upon the grassy carpet of this plain. Let’s march without the noise of threat’ning drum, That from this castle’s tottered battlements Our fair appointments may be well perused. Methinks King Richard and myself should meet With no less terror than the elements Of fire and water, when their thund’ring shock At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven. Be he the fire, I’ll be the yielding water; The rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain My waters—on the earth, and not on him. March on, and mark King Richard how he looks.   A parley sounded, and answered by a trumpet within. Flourish. Enter on  the Walls, the King, the Bishop of Carlisle, Aumerle, Scroop and  Salisbury
  ACT IV  SCENE I. Westminster Hall.
 The Lords spiritual on the right side of the throne; the Lords  temporal on the left; the Commons below. Enter Bolingbroke, Aumerle,  Surrey, Northumberland, Harry Percy, Fitzwater, another Lord, the  Bishop of Carlisle, the Abbot of Westminster and attendants.  BOLINGBROKE. Call forth Bagot.   Enter Officers with Bagot.

The trumpets sound. Enter young Prince Edward, Richard, Buckingham, Cardinal Bourchier, Catesby and others.  BUCKINGHAM. Welcome, sweet Prince, to London, to your chamber.  RICHARD. Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts’ sovereign. The weary way hath made you melancholy.  PRINCE. No, uncle, but our crosses on the way Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy. I want more uncles here to welcome me.  RICHARD. Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years Hath not yet dived into the world’s deceit, Nor more can you distinguish of a man Than of his outward show, which, God He knows, Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart. Those uncles which you want were dangerous; Your Grace attended to their sugared words But looked not on the poison of their hearts. God keep you from them, and from such false friends!  PRINCE. God keep me from false friends, but they were none.  RICHARD. My lord, the Mayor of London comes to greet you.  Enter Lord Mayor with Attendants.  MAYOR. God bless your Grace with health and happy days!  PRINCE. I thank you, good my lord, and thank you all. I thought my mother and my brother York Would long ere this have met us on the way. Fie, what a slug is Hastings, that he comes not To tell us whether they will come or no!  Enter Lord Hastings.  BUCKINGHAM. And in good time, here comes the sweating lord.  PRINCE. Welcome, my lord. What, will our mother come?  HASTINGS. On what occasion God He knows, not I, The Queen your mother and your brother York Have taken sanctuary. The tender prince Would fain have come with me to meet your Grace, But by his mother was perforce withheld.  BUCKINGHAM. Fie, what an indirect and peevish course Is this of hers? Lord cardinal, will your Grace Persuade the Queen to send the Duke of York Unto his princely brother presently? If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him, And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.  CARDINAL. My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory Can from his mother win the Duke of York, Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid We should infringe the holy privilege Of blessed sanctuary! Not for all this land Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.  BUCKINGHAM. You are too senseless-obstinate, my lord, Too ceremonious and traditional. Weigh it but with the grossness of this age, You break not sanctuary in seizing him. The benefit thereof is always granted To those whose dealings have deserved the place And those who have the wit to claim the place. This prince hath neither claimed it nor deserved it And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it. Then taking him from thence that is not there, You break no privilege nor charter there. Oft have I heard of sanctuary-men, But sanctuary children, never till now.  CARDINAL. My lord, you shall o’errule my mind for once. Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?  HASTINGS. I go, my lord.  PRINCE. Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.  [_Exeunt Cardinal and Hastings._]  Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come, Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?  RICHARD. Where it seems best unto your royal self. If I may counsel you, some day or two Your Highness shall repose you at the Tower, Then where you please and shall be thought most fit For your best health and recreation.  PRINCE. I do not like the Tower, of any place. Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?  BUCKINGHAM. He did, my gracious lord, begin that place, Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.  PRINCE. Is it upon record, or else reported Successively from age to age, he built it?  BUCKINGHAM. Upon record, my gracious lord.  PRINCE. But say, my lord, it were not registered, Methinks the truth should live from age to age, As ’twere retailed to all posterity, Even to the general all-ending day.  RICHARD. [_Aside_.] So wise so young, they say, do never live long.  PRINCE. What say you, uncle?  RICHARD. I say, without characters, fame lives long. [_Aside_.] Thus, like the formal Vice, Iniquity, I moralize two meanings in one word.  PRINCE. That Julius Caesar was a famous man. With what his valour did enrich his wit, His wit set down to make his valour live; Death makes no conquest of this conqueror, For now he lives in fame, though not in life. I’ll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham.  BUCKINGHAM. What, my gracious lord?  PRINCE. An if I live until I be a man, I’ll win our ancient right in France again, Or die a soldier, as I lived a king.  RICHARD. [_Aside_.] Short summers lightly have a forward spring.  Enter young Duke of York, Hastings and the Cardinal.  BUCKINGHAM. Now, in good time here comes the Duke of York.  PRINCE. Richard of York, how fares our loving brother?  YORK. Well, my dread lord—so must I call you now.  PRINCE. Ay brother, to our grief, as it is yours. Too late he died that might have kept that title, Which by his death hath lost much majesty.  RICHARD. How fares our cousin, noble lord of York?  YORK. I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord, You said that idle weeds are fast in growth. The Prince my brother hath outgrown me far.  RICHARD. He hath, my lord.  YORK. And therefore is he idle?  RICHARD. O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.  YORK. Then he is more beholding to you than I.  RICHARD. He may command me as my sovereign, But you have power in me as in a kinsman.  YORK. I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.  RICHARD. My dagger, little cousin? With all my heart.  PRINCE. A beggar, brother?  YORK. Of my kind uncle, that I know will give, And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.  RICHARD. A greater gift than that I’ll give my cousin.  YORK. A greater gift? O, that’s the sword to it.  RICHARD. Ay, gentle cousin, were it light enough.  YORK. O, then I see you will part but with light gifts; In weightier things you’ll say a beggar nay.  RICHARD. It is too heavy for your Grace to wear.  YORK. I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.  RICHARD. What, would you have my weapon, little lord?  YORK. I would, that I might thank you as you call me.  RICHARD. How?  YORK. Little.  PRINCE. My lord of York will still be cross in talk. Uncle, your Grace knows how to bear with him.  YORK. You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me. Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me. Because that I am little, like an ape, He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.  BUCKINGHAM. With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons! To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle, He prettily and aptly taunts himself. So cunning and so young is wonderful.  RICHARD. My lord, wil’t please you pass along? Myself and my good cousin Buckingham Will to your mother, to entreat of her To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.  YORK. What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?  PRINCE. My Lord Protector needs will have it so.  YORK. I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.  RICHARD. Why, what should you fear?  YORK. Marry, my uncle Clarence’ angry ghost. My grandam told me he was murdered there.  PRINCE. I fear no uncles dead.  RICHARD. Nor none that live, I hope.  PRINCE. An if they live, I hope I need not fear. But come, my lord. With a heavy heart, Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.  [_A Sennet. Exeunt Prince Edward, York, Hastings, Dorset and all but Richard, Buckingham and Catesby._]  BUCKINGHAM. Think you, my lord, this little prating York Was not incensed by his subtle mother To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?  RICHARD. No doubt, no doubt. O, ’tis a parlous boy, Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable. He is all the mother’s, from the top to toe.  BUCKINGHAM. Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby. Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend As closely to conceal what we impart. Thou know’st our reasons urged upon the way. What think’st thou? Is it not an easy matter To make William Lord Hastings of our mind For the instalment of this noble Duke In the seat royal of this famous isle?  CATESBY. He for his father’s sake so loves the Prince That he will not be won to aught against him.  BUCKINGHAM. What think’st thou then of Stanley? Will not he?  CATESBY. He will do all in all as Hastings doth.  BUCKINGHAM. Well then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby, And, as it were far off, sound thou Lord Hastings How he doth stand affected to our purpose, And summon him tomorrow to the Tower To sit about the coronation. If thou dost find him tractable to us, Encourage him, and tell him all our reasons. If he be leaden, icy, cold, unwilling, Be thou so too, and so break off the talk, And give us notice of his inclination; For we tomorrow hold divided councils, Wherein thyself shalt highly be employed.  RICHARD. Commend me to Lord William. Tell him, Catesby, His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries Tomorrow are let blood at Pomfret Castle, And bid my lord, for joy of this good news, Give Mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more.  BUCKINGHAM. Good Catesby, go effect this business soundly.  CATESBY. My good lords both, with all the heed I can.  RICHARD. Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?  CATESBY. You shall, my lord.  RICHARD. At Crosby Place, there shall you find us both.  [_Exit Catesby._]  BUCKINGHAM. Now, my lord, what shall we do if we perceive Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?  RICHARD. Chop off his head, man; somewhat we will do. And look when I am king, claim thou of me The earldom of Hereford, and all the movables Whereof the King my brother was possessed.  BUCKINGHAM. I’ll claim that promise at your Grace’s hand.  RICHARD. And look to have it yielded with all kindness. Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards We may digest our complots in some form.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. Before Lord Hastings’ house  Enter a Messenger to the door of Hastings.  MESSENGER. My lord, my lord!  [_Knocking._]  HASTINGS. [_Within_.] Who knocks?  MESSENGER. One from the Lord Stanley.  HASTINGS. [_Within_.] What is’t o’clock?  MESSENGER. Upon the stroke of four.  Enter Hastings.  HASTINGS. Cannot my Lord Stanley sleep these tedious nights?  MESSENGER. So it appears by that I have to say. First, he commends him to your noble self.  HASTINGS. What then?  MESSENGER. Then certifies your lordship that this night He dreamt the boar had razed off his helm. Besides, he says there are two councils kept, And that may be determined at the one Which may make you and him to rue at th’ other. Therefore he sends to know your lordship’s pleasure, If you will presently take horse with him And with all speed post with him toward the north, To shun the danger that his soul divines.  HASTINGS. Go, fellow, go. Return unto thy lord; Bid him not fear the separated council. His honour and myself are at the one, And at the other is my good friend Catesby, Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us Whereof I shall not have intelligence. Tell him his fears are shallow, without instance. And for his dreams, I wonder he’s so simple To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers. To fly the boar before the boar pursues Were to incense the boar to follow us, And make pursuit where he did mean no chase. Go, bid thy master rise and come to me, And we will both together to the Tower, Where he shall see the boar will use us kindly.  MESSENGER. I’ll go, my lord, and tell him what you say.  [_Exit._]  Enter Catesby.  CATESBY. Many good morrows to my noble lord.  HASTINGS. Good morrow, Catesby; you are early stirring. What news, what news in this our tott’ring state?  CATESBY. It is a reeling world indeed, my lord, And I believe will never stand upright Till Richard wear the garland of the realm.  HASTINGS. How, wear the garland? Dost thou mean the crown?  CATESBY. Ay, my good lord.  HASTINGS. I’ll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders Before I’ll see the crown so foul misplaced. But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?  CATESBY. Ay, on my life, and hopes to find you forward Upon his party for the gain thereof; And thereupon he sends you this good news, That this same very day your enemies, The kindred of the Queen, must die at Pomfret.  HASTINGS. Indeed, I am no mourner for that news, Because they have been still my adversaries. But that I’ll give my voice on Richard’s side To bar my master’s heirs in true descent, God knows I will not do it, to the death.  CATESBY. God keep your lordship in that gracious mind.  HASTINGS. But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence, That they which brought me in my master’s hate, I live to look upon their tragedy. Well, Catesby, ere a fortnight make me older I’ll send some packing that yet think not on’t.  CATESBY. ’Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord, When men are unprepared and look not for it.  HASTINGS. O monstrous, monstrous! And so falls it out With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey; and so ’twill do With some men else that think themselves as safe As thou and I, who, as thou know’st, are dear To princely Richard and to Buckingham.  CATESBY. The Princes both make high account of you— [_Aside_.] For they account his head upon the Bridge.  HASTINGS. I know they do, and I have well deserved it.  Enter Stanley Earl of Derby.  Come on, come on. Where is your boar-spear, man? Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided?  STANLEY. My lord, good morrow; good morrow, Catesby. You may jest on, but, by the Holy Rood, I do not like these several councils, I.  HASTINGS. My lord, I hold my life as dear as you do yours, And never in my days, I do protest, Was it so precious to me as ’tis now. Think you, but that I know our state secure, I would be so triumphant as I am?  STANLEY. The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from London, Were jocund and supposed their states were sure, And they indeed had no cause to mistrust; But yet you see how soon the day o’ercast. This sudden stab of rancour I misdoubt; Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward. What, shall we toward the Tower? The day is spent.  HASTINGS. Come, come. Have with you. Wot you what, my lord? Today the lords you talked of are beheaded.  STANLEY. They, for their truth, might better wear their heads Than some that have accused them wear their hats. But come, my lord, let’s away.  Enter a Pursuivant.  HASTINGS. Go on before; I’ll talk with this good fellow.  [_Exeunt Stanley and Catesby._]  How now, sirrah? How goes the world with thee?  PURSUIVANT. The better that your lordship please to ask.  HASTINGS. I tell thee, man, ’tis better with me now Than when thou met’st me last where now we meet. Then was I going prisoner to the Tower, By the suggestion of the Queen’s allies. But now, I tell thee—keep it to thyself— This day those enemies are put to death, And I in better state than e’er I was.  PURSUIVANT. God hold it, to your honour’s good content!  HASTINGS. Gramercy, fellow. There, drink that for me.  [_Throws him his purse._]  PURSUIVANT. I thank your honour.  [_Exit._]  Enter a Priest.  PRIEST. Well met, my lord; I am glad to see your honour.  HASTINGS. I thank thee, good Sir John, with all my heart. I am in your debt for your last exercise. Come the next sabbath, and I will content you.  Enter Buckingham.  PRIEST. I’ll wait upon your lordship.  [_Exit Priest._]  BUCKINGHAM. What, talking with a priest, Lord Chamberlain? Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest; Your honour hath no shriving work in hand.  HASTINGS. Good faith, and when I met this holy man, The men you talk of came into my mind. What, go you toward the Tower?  BUCKINGHAM. I do, my lord, but long I cannot stay there. I shall return before your lordship thence.  HASTINGS. Nay, like enough, for I stay dinner there.  BUCKINGHAM. [_Aside_.] And supper too, although thou knowest it not. Come, will you go?  HASTINGS. I’ll wait upon your lordship.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. Pomfret. Before the Castle  Enter Sir Richard Ratcliffe, with Halberds, carrying the nobles Rivers, Grey and Vaughan to death at Pomfret.  RIVERS. Sir Richard Ratcliffe, let me tell thee this: Today shalt thou behold a subject die For truth, for duty, and for loyalty.  GREY. God bless the Prince from all the pack of you! A knot you are of damned bloodsuckers.  VAUGHAN You live that shall cry woe for this hereafter.  RATCLIFFE Dispatch. The limit of your lives is out.  RIVERS. O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison, Fatal and ominous to noble peers! Within the guilty closure of thy walls Richard the Second here was hacked to death; And, for more slander to thy dismal seat, We give to thee our guiltless blood to drink.  GREY. Now Margaret’s curse is fall’n upon our heads, When she exclaimed on Hastings, you, and I, For standing by when Richard stabbed her son.  RIVERS. Then cursed she Richard, then cursed she Buckingham, Then cursed she Hastings. O, remember, God, To hear her prayer for them, as now for us! And for my sister and her princely sons, Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood, Which, as thou know’st, unjustly must be spilt.  RATCLIFFE. Make haste. The hour of death is expiate.  RIVERS. Come, Grey, come, Vaughan, let us here embrace. Farewell, until we meet again in heaven.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IV. London. A Room in the Tower  Enter Buckingham, Stanley Earl of Derby, Hastings, the Bishop of Ely, Norfolk, Ratcliffe, Lovell with others, at a table.  HASTINGS. Now, noble peers, the cause why we are met Is to determine of the coronation. In God’s name speak. When is the royal day?  BUCKINGHAM. Is all things ready for that royal time?  STANLEY. It is, and wants but nomination.  ELY. Tomorrow, then, I judge a happy day.  BUCKINGHAM. Who knows the Lord Protector’s mind herein? Who is most inward with the noble Duke?  ELY. Your Grace, we think, should soonest know his mind.  BUCKINGHAM. We know each other’s faces; for our hearts, He knows no more of mine than I of yours, Or I of his, my lord, than you of mine. Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love.  HASTINGS. I thank his Grace, I know he loves me well; But for his purpose in the coronation I have not sounded him, nor he delivered His gracious pleasure any way therein. But you, my honourable lords, may name the time, And in the Duke’s behalf I’ll give my voice, Which I presume he’ll take in gentle part.  Enter Richard.  ELY. In happy time, here comes the Duke himself.  RICHARD. My noble lords and cousins all, good morrow. I have been long a sleeper; but I trust My absence doth neglect no great design Which by my presence might have been concluded.  BUCKINGHAM. Had you not come upon your cue, my lord, William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part— I mean your voice for crowning of the King.  RICHARD. Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder. His lordship knows me well and loves me well. My lord of Ely, when I was last in Holborn I saw good strawberries in your garden there; I do beseech you, send for some of them.  ELY. Marry, and will, my lord, with all my heart.  [_Exit._]  RICHARD. Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.  [_They move aside._]  Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business, And finds the testy gentleman so hot That he will lose his head ere give consent His master’s child, as worshipfully he terms it, Shall lose the royalty of England’s throne.  BUCKINGHAM. Withdraw yourself awhile. I’ll go with you.  [_Exeunt Richard and Buckingham._]  STANLEY. We have not yet set down this day of triumph. Tomorrow, in my judgement, is too sudden, For I myself am not so well provided As else I would be, were the day prolonged.  Enter Bishop of Ely.  ELY. Where is my lord the Duke of Gloucester? I have sent for these strawberries.  HASTINGS. His Grace looks cheerfully and smooth this morning. There’s some conceit or other likes him well When that he bids good morrow with such spirit. I think there’s never a man in Christendom Can lesser hide his love or hate than he, For by his face straight shall you know his heart.  STANLEY. What of his heart perceive you in his face By any livelihood he showed today?  HASTINGS. Marry, that with no man here he is offended, For were he, he had shown it in his looks.  Enter Richard and Buckingham.  RICHARD. I pray you all, tell me what they deserve That do conspire my death with devilish plots Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevailed Upon my body with their hellish charms?  HASTINGS. The tender love I bear your Grace, my lord, Makes me most forward in this princely presence To doom th’ offenders, whosoe’er they be. I say, my lord, they have deserved death.  RICHARD. Then be your eyes the witness of their evil. Look how I am bewitched! Behold, mine arm Is like a blasted sapling withered up! And this is Edward’s wife, that monstrous witch, Consorted with that harlot, strumpet Shore, That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.  HASTINGS. If they have done this deed, my noble lord—  RICHARD. If? Thou protector of this damned strumpet, Talk’st thou to me of “ifs”? Thou art a traitor. Off with his head! Now by Saint Paul I swear I will not dine until I see the same. Lovell and Ratcliffe, look that it be done. The rest that love me, rise and follow me.  [_Exeunt all but Lovell and Ratcliffe with the Lord Hastings._]  HASTINGS. Woe, woe, for England! Not a whit for me, For I, too fond, might have prevented this. Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm, And I did scorn it and disdain to fly. Three times today my foot-cloth horse did stumble, And started when he looked upon the Tower, As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house. O, now I need the priest that spake to me; I now repent I told the pursuivant, As too triumphing, how mine enemies Today at Pomfret bloodily were butchered, And I myself secure in grace and favour. O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse Is lighted on poor Hastings’ wretched head.  RATCLIFFE. Come, come, dispatch. The Duke would be at dinner: Make a short shrift. He longs to see your head.  HASTINGS. O momentary grace of mortal men, Which we more hunt for than the grace of God! Who builds his hope in air of your good looks Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast, Ready with every nod to tumble down Into the fatal bowels of the deep.  LOVELL. Come, come, dispatch. ’Tis bootless to exclaim.  HASTINGS. O bloody Richard! Miserable England, I prophesy the fearfull’st time to thee That ever wretched age hath looked upon. Come, lead me to the block. Bear him my head. They smile at me who shortly shall be dead.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE V. London. The Tower Walls  Enter Richard and Buckingham in rotten armour, marvellous ill-favoured.  RICHARD. Come, cousin, canst thou quake and change thy colour, Murder thy breath in middle of a word, And then again begin, and stop again, As if thou were distraught and mad with terror?  BUCKINGHAM. Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian; Speak, and look back, and pry on every side, Tremble and start at wagging of a straw, Intending deep suspicion. Ghastly looks Are at my service, like enforced smiles, And both are ready in their offices, At anytime to grace my stratagems. But what, is Catesby gone?  RICHARD. He is; and, see, he brings the Mayor along.  Enter the Lord Mayor and Catesby.  BUCKINGHAM. Lord Mayor—  RICHARD. Look to the drawbridge there!  BUCKINGHAM. Hark, a drum.  RICHARD. Catesby, o’erlook the walls.  BUCKINGHAM. Lord Mayor, the reason we have sent—  RICHARD. Look back! Defend thee, here are enemies.  BUCKINGHAM. God and our innocence defend and guard us!  Enter Lovell and Ratcliffe with Hastings’ head.  RICHARD. Be patient, they are friends, Ratcliffe and Lovell.  LOVELL. Here is the head of that ignoble traitor, The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.  RICHARD. So dear I loved the man that I must weep. I took him for the plainest harmless creature That breathed upon the earth a Christian; Made him my book, wherein my soul recorded The history of all her secret thoughts. So smooth he daubed his vice with show of virtue That, his apparent open guilt omitted— I mean his conversation with Shore’s wife— He lived from all attainder of suspects.  BUCKINGHAM. Well, well, he was the covert’st sheltered traitor That ever lived.— Would you imagine, or almost believe, Were’t not that by great preservation We live to tell it, that the subtle traitor This day had plotted, in the council-house, To murder me and my good lord of Gloucester?  MAYOR. Had he done so?  RICHARD. What, think you we are Turks or Infidels? Or that we would, against the form of law, Proceed thus rashly in the villain’s death, But that the extreme peril of the case, The peace of England, and our persons’ safety, Enforced us to this execution?  MAYOR. Now, fair befall you! He deserved his death, And your good Graces both have well proceeded, To warn false traitors from the like attempts.  BUCKINGHAM. I never looked for better at his hands After he once fell in with Mistress Shore. Yet had we not determined he should die Until your lordship came to see his end Which now the loving haste of these our friends, Something against our meanings, have prevented, Because, my lord, we would have had you heard The traitor speak, and timorously confess The manner and the purpose of his treasons, That you might well have signified the same Unto the citizens, who haply may Misconster us in him, and wail his death.  MAYOR. But, my good lord, your Grace’s word shall serve As well as I had seen and heard him speak; And do not doubt, right noble princes both, But I’ll acquaint our duteous citizens With all your just proceedings in this case.  RICHARD. And to that end we wished your lordship here, T’ avoid the censures of the carping world.  BUCKINGHAM. But since you come too late of our intent, Yet witness what you hear we did intend. And so, my good Lord Mayor, we bid farewell.  [_Exit Lord Mayor._]  RICHARD. Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham. The Mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post. There, at your meet’st advantage of the time, Infer the bastardy of Edward’s children; Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen Only for saying he would make his son Heir to the Crown—meaning indeed his house, Which, by the sign thereof, was termed so. Moreover, urge his hateful luxury And bestial appetite in change of lust, Which stretched unto their servants, daughters, wives, Even where his raging eye or savage heart, Without control, lusted to make a prey. Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person: Tell them, when that my mother went with child Of that insatiate Edward, noble York My princely father then had wars in France, And, by true computation of the time, Found that the issue was not his begot; Which well appeared in his lineaments, Being nothing like the noble Duke, my father. Yet touch this sparingly, as ’twere far off; Because, my lord, you know my mother lives.  BUCKINGHAM. Doubt not, my lord, I’ll play the orator As if the golden fee for which I plead Were for myself. And so, my lord, adieu.  RICHARD. If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard’s Castle, Where you shall find me well accompanied With reverend fathers and well-learned bishops.  BUCKINGHAM. I go; and towards three or four o’clock Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.  [_Exit._]  RICHARD. Go, Lovell, with all speed to Doctor Shaa. [_To Ratcliffe_.] Go thou to Friar Penker; bid them both Meet me within this hour at Baynard’s Castle.  [_Exeunt Ratcliffe and Lovell._]  Now will I go to take some privy order To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight, And to give order that no manner person Have any time recourse unto the Princes.  [_Exit._]  SCENE VI. London. A street  Enter a Scrivener.  SCRIVENER. Here is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings, Which in a set hand fairly is engrossed, That it may be today read o’er in Paul’s. And mark how well the sequel hangs together: Eleven hours I have spent to write it over, For yesternight by Catesby was it sent me; The precedent was full as long a-doing And yet within these five hours Hastings lived, Untainted, unexamined, free, at liberty. Here’s a good world the while! Who is so gross That cannot see this palpable device? Yet who so bold but says he sees it not? Bad is the world, and all will come to naught When such ill dealing must be seen in thought.  [_Exit._]  SCENE VII. London. Court of Baynard’s Castle  Enter Richard and Buckingham at several doors.  RICHARD. How now, how now? What say the citizens?  BUCKINGHAM. Now, by the holy mother of our Lord, The citizens are mum, say not a word.  RICHARD. Touched you the bastardy of Edward’s children?  BUCKINGHAM. I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy, And his contract by deputy in France; Th’ insatiate greediness of his desire, And his enforcement of the city wives; His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy, As being got, your father then in France, And his resemblance, being not like the Duke. Withal, I did infer your lineaments, Being the right idea of your father, Both in your form and nobleness of mind; Laid open all your victories in Scotland, Your discipline in war, wisdom in peace, Your bounty, virtue, fair humility; Indeed, left nothing fitting for your purpose Untouched or slightly handled in discourse. And when mine oratory drew toward end, I bid them that did love their country’s good Cry “God save Richard, England’s royal King!”  RICHARD. And did they so?  BUCKINGHAM. No, so God help me, they spake not a word, But, like dumb statues or breathing stones, Stared each on other, and looked deadly pale. Which when I saw, I reprehended them, And asked the Mayor what meant this wilful silence. His answer was, the people were not used To be spoke to but by the Recorder. Then he was urged to tell my tale again: “Thus saith the Duke, thus hath the Duke inferred” But nothing spoke in warrant from himself. When he had done, some followers of mine own, At lower end of the hall, hurled up their caps, And some ten voices cried, “God save King Richard!” And thus I took the vantage of those few. “Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,” quoth I; “This general applause and cheerful shout Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard.” And even here brake off and came away.  RICHARD. What, tongueless blocks were they! Would they not speak? Will not the Mayor then and his brethren, come?  BUCKINGHAM. The mayor is here at hand. Intend some fear; Be not you spoke with but by mighty suit. And look you get a prayer-book in your hand, And stand between two churchmen, good my lord, For on that ground I’ll make a holy descant. And be not easily won to our requests. Play the maid’s part: still answer nay, and take it.  RICHARD. I go, and if you plead as well for them As I can say nay to thee for myself, No doubt we bring it to a happy issue.  BUCKINGHAM. Go, go, up to the leads, the Lord Mayor knocks.  [_Exit Richard._]  Enter the Lord Mayor and Citizens.  Welcome, my lord. I dance attendance here. I think the Duke will not be spoke withal.  Enter Catesby.  Now, Catesby, what says your lord to my request?  CATESBY. He doth entreat your Grace, my noble lord, To visit him tomorrow or next day. He is within, with two right reverend fathers, Divinely bent to meditation; And in no worldly suits would he be moved To draw him from his holy exercise.  BUCKINGHAM. Return, good Catesby, to the gracious Duke; Tell him myself, the Mayor and aldermen, In deep designs, in matter of great moment, No less importing than our general good, Are come to have some conference with his Grace.  CATESBY. I’ll signify so much unto him straight.  [_Exit._]  BUCKINGHAM. Ah ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward! He is not lolling on a lewd love-bed, But on his knees at meditation; Not dallying with a brace of courtesans, But meditating with two deep divines; Not sleeping, to engross his idle body, But praying, to enrich his watchful soul. Happy were England would this virtuous prince Take on his Grace the sovereignty thereof. But sure I fear we shall not win him to it.  MAYOR. Marry, God defend his Grace should say us nay!  BUCKINGHAM. I fear he will. Here Catesby comes again.  Enter Catesby.  Now, Catesby, what says his Grace?  CATESBY. He wonders to what end you have assembled Such troops of citizens to come to him, His Grace not being warned thereof before. He fears, my lord, you mean no good to him.  BUCKINGHAM. Sorry I am my noble cousin should Suspect me that I mean no good to him. By heaven, we come to him in perfect love, And so once more return and tell his Grace.  [_Exit Catesby._]  When holy and devout religious men Are at their beads, ’tis much to draw them thence, So sweet is zealous contemplation.  Enter Richard aloft, between two Bishops. Catesby reenters.  MAYOR. See where his Grace stands ’tween two clergymen!  BUCKINGHAM. Two props of virtue for a Christian prince, To stay him from the fall of vanity; And, see, a book of prayer in his hand, True ornaments to know a holy man. Famous Plantagenet, most gracious Prince, Lend favourable ear to our requests, And pardon us the interruption Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.  RICHARD. My lord, there needs no such apology. I do beseech your Grace to pardon me, Who, earnest in the service of my God, Deferred the visitation of my friends. But, leaving this, what is your Grace’s pleasure?  BUCKINGHAM. Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above, And all good men of this ungoverned isle.  RICHARD. I do suspect I have done some offence That seems disgracious in the city’s eye, And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.  BUCKINGHAM. You have, my lord. Would it might please your Grace, On our entreaties, to amend your fault.  RICHARD. Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?  BUCKINGHAM. Know then, it is your fault that you resign The supreme seat, the throne majestical, The sceptered office of your ancestors, Your state of fortune, and your due of birth, The lineal glory of your royal house, To the corruption of a blemished stock; Whiles in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts, Which here we waken to our country’s good, The noble isle doth want her proper limbs; Her face defaced with scars of infamy, Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants, And almost shouldered in the swallowing gulf Of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion; Which to recure, we heartily solicit Your gracious self to take on you the charge And kingly government of this your land, Not as Protector, steward, substitute, Or lowly factor for another’s gain, But as successively, from blood to blood, Your right of birth, your empery, your own. For this, consorted with the citizens, Your very worshipful and loving friends, And by their vehement instigation, In this just cause come I to move your Grace.  RICHARD. I cannot tell if to depart in silence Or bitterly to speak in your reproof Best fitteth my degree or your condition. If not to answer, you might haply think Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty, Which fondly you would here impose on me; If to reprove you for this suit of yours, So seasoned with your faithful love to me, Then, on the other side, I checked my friends. Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first, And then, in speaking, not to incur the last, Definitively thus I answer you: Your love deserves my thanks, but my desert Unmeritable shuns your high request. First, if all obstacles were cut away, And that my path were even to the crown As the ripe revenue and due of birth, Yet so much is my poverty of spirit, So mighty and so many my defects, That I would rather hide me from my greatness, Being a bark to brook no mighty sea, Than in my greatness covet to be hid, And in the vapour of my glory smothered. But, God be thanked, there is no need of me, And much I need to help you, were there need. The royal tree hath left us royal fruit, Which, mellowed by the stealing hours of time, Will well become the seat of majesty, And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign. On him I lay that you would lay on me, The right and fortune of his happy stars, Which God defend that I should wring from him.  BUCKINGHAM. My lord, this argues conscience in your Grace; But the respects thereof are nice and trivial, All circumstances well considered. You say that Edward is your brother’s son; So say we too, but not by Edward’s wife. For first was he contract to Lady Lucy Your mother lives a witness to his vow, And afterward by substitute betrothed To Bona, sister to the King of France. These both put off, a poor petitioner, A care-crazed mother to a many sons, A beauty-waning and distressed widow, Even in the afternoon of her best days, Made prize and purchase of his wanton eye, Seduced the pitch and height of his degree To base declension and loathed bigamy. By her, in his unlawful bed, he got This Edward, whom our manners call the Prince. More bitterly could I expostulate, Save that, for reverence to some alive, I give a sparing limit to my tongue. Then, good my lord, take to your royal self This proffered benefit of dignity, If not to bless us and the land withal, Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry From the corruption of abusing times Unto a lineal true-derived course.  MAYOR. Do, good my lord. Your citizens entreat you.  BUCKINGHAM. Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffered love.  CATESBY. O, make them joyful; grant their lawful suit.  RICHARD. Alas, why would you heap those cares on me? I am unfit for state and majesty. I do beseech you, take it not amiss; I cannot, nor I will not, yield to you.  BUCKINGHAM. If you refuse it, as in love and zeal Loath to depose the child, your brother’s son— As well we know your tenderness of heart And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse, Which we have noted in you to your kindred, And equally indeed to all estates— Yet know, whe’er you accept our suit or no, Your brother’s son shall never reign our king, But we will plant some other in the throne, To the disgrace and downfall of your house. And in this resolution here we leave you. Come, citizens; zounds, I’ll entreat no more.  [_Exeunt Buckingham, the Mayor and citizens._]  CATESBY. Call him again, sweet Prince; accept their suit. If you deny them, all the land will rue it.  RICHARD. Will you enforce me to a world of cares? Call them again. I am not made of stones, But penetrable to your kind entreaties, Albeit against my conscience and my soul.  Enter Buckingham and the rest.  Cousin of Buckingham, and sage grave men, Since you will buckle Fortune on my back, To bear her burden, whe’er I will or no, I must have patience to endure the load. But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach Attend the sequel of your imposition, Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me From all the impure blots and stains thereof, For God doth know, and you may partly see, How far I am from the desire of this.  MAYOR. God bless your Grace! We see it, and will say it.  RICHARD. In saying so, you shall but say the truth.  BUCKINGHAM. Then I salute you with this royal title: Long live King Richard, England’s worthy King!  ALL. Amen.  BUCKINGHAM. Tomorrow may it please you to be crowned?  RICHARD. Even when you please, for you will have it so.  BUCKINGHAM. Tomorrow, then, we will attend your Grace; And so most joyfully we take our leave.  RICHARD. [_To the Bishops_.] Come, let us to our holy work again. Farewell, my cousin, farewell, gentle friends.  [_Exeunt._]
  ACT IV  SCENE I. London. Before the Tower
Enter Queen Elizabeth, the Duchess of York and Marquess of Dorset, at one door; Anne Duchess of Gloucester with Clarence’s young Daughter at another door.  DUCHESS. Who meets us here? My niece Plantagenet Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester? Now, for my life, she’s wandering to the Tower, On pure heart’s love, to greet the tender Prince. Daughter, well met.  ANNE. God give your Graces both A happy and a joyful time of day.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. As much to you, good sister. Whither away?  ANNE. No farther than the Tower, and, as I guess, Upon the like devotion as yourselves, To gratulate the gentle Princes there.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Kind sister, thanks; we’ll enter all together.  Enter Brakenbury.  And in good time, here the Lieutenant comes. Master Lieutenant, pray you, by your leave, How doth the Prince and my young son of York?  BRAKENBURY. Right well, dear madam. By your patience, I may not suffer you to visit them. The King hath strictly charged the contrary.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. The King? Who’s that?  BRAKENBURY. I mean the Lord Protector.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. The Lord protect him from that kingly title! Hath he set bounds between their love and me? I am their mother; who shall bar me from them?  DUCHESS. I am their father’s mother. I will see them.  ANNE. Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother. Then bring me to their sights. I’ll bear thy blame, And take thy office from thee, on my peril.  BRAKENBURY. No, madam, no. I may not leave it so. I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me.  [_Exit._]  Enter Stanley.  STANLEY. Let me but meet you, ladies, one hour hence, And I’ll salute your Grace of York as mother And reverend looker-on of two fair queens. [_To Anne._] Come, madam, you must straight to Westminster, There to be crowned Richard’s royal queen.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Ah, cut my lace asunder That my pent heart may have some scope to beat, Or else I swoon with this dead-killing news!  ANNE. Despiteful tidings! O unpleasing news!  DORSET. Be of good cheer, mother. How fares your Grace?  QUEEN ELIZABETH. O Dorset, speak not to me; get thee gone. Death and destruction dog thee at thy heels; Thy mother’s name is ominous to children. If thou wilt outstrip death, go, cross the seas, And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell. Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughter-house, Lest thou increase the number of the dead, And make me die the thrall of Margaret’s curse, Nor mother, wife, nor England’s counted Queen.  STANLEY. Full of wise care is this your counsel, madam. Take all the swift advantage of the hours; You shall have letters from me to my son In your behalf, to meet you on the way. Be not ta’en tardy by unwise delay.  DUCHESS. O ill-dispersing wind of misery! O my accursed womb, the bed of death! A cockatrice hast thou hatched to the world, Whose unavoided eye is murderous.  STANLEY. Come, madam, come. I in all haste was sent.  ANNE. And I with all unwillingness will go. O, would to God that the inclusive verge Of golden metal that must round my brow Were red-hot steel, to sear me to the brains. Anointed let me be with deadly venom, And die ere men can say “God save the Queen.”  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Go, go, poor soul; I envy not thy glory. To feed my humour, wish thyself no harm.  ANNE. No? Why? When he that is my husband now Came to me as I followed Henry’s corse, When scarce the blood was well washed from his hands Which issued from my other angel husband, And that dear saint which then I weeping followed; O, when, I say, I looked on Richard’s face, This was my wish: “Be thou,” quoth I, “accursed For making me, so young, so old a widow; And when thou wedd’st, let sorrow haunt thy bed; And be thy wife, if any be so mad, More miserable by the life of thee Than thou hast made me by my dear lord’s death.” Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again, Within so small a time, my woman’s heart Grossly grew captive to his honey words, And proved the subject of mine own soul’s curse, Which hitherto hath held my eyes from rest; For never yet one hour in his bed Did I enjoy the golden dew of sleep, But with his timorous dreams was still awaked. Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick, And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Poor heart, adieu; I pity thy complaining.  ANNE. No more than with my soul I mourn for yours.  DORSET. Farewell, thou woeful welcomer of glory.  ANNE. Adieu, poor soul, that tak’st thy leave of it.  DUCHESS. [_To Dorset._] Go thou to Richmond, and good fortune guide thee. [_To Anne._] Go thou to Richard, and good angels tend thee. [_To Queen Elizabeth._] Go thou to sanctuary, and good thoughts possess thee. I to my grave, where peace and rest lie with me. Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen, And each hour’s joy wracked with a week of teen.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Stay, yet look back with me unto the Tower. Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes Whom envy hath immured within your walls— Rough cradle for such little pretty one, Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow For tender princes, use my babies well. So foolish sorrows bids your stones farewell.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. London. A Room of State in the Palace  The trumpets sound a sennet. Enter Richard in pomp, Buckingham, Catesby, Ratcliffe, Lovell, a Page and others.  KING RICHARD. Stand all apart. Cousin of Buckingham!  BUCKINGHAM. My gracious sovereign!  KING RICHARD. Give me thy hand.  [_Here he ascendeth the throne. Sound trumpets._]  Thus high, by thy advice And thy assistance is King Richard seated. But shall we wear these glories for a day, Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them?  BUCKINGHAM. Still live they, and for ever let them last!  KING RICHARD. Ah, Buckingham, now do I play the touch, To try if thou be current gold indeed. Young Edward lives; think now what I would speak.  BUCKINGHAM. Say on, my loving lord.  KING RICHARD. Why, Buckingham, I say I would be King.  BUCKINGHAM. Why, so you are, my thrice-renowned lord.  KING RICHARD. Ha! Am I King? ’Tis so—but Edward lives.  BUCKINGHAM. True, noble Prince.  KING RICHARD. O bitter consequence, That Edward still should live “true noble prince!” Cousin, thou wast not wont to be so dull. Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead, And I would have it suddenly performed. What sayst thou now? Speak suddenly, be brief.  BUCKINGHAM. Your Grace may do your pleasure.  KING RICHARD. Tut, tut, thou art all ice; thy kindness freezes. Say, have I thy consent that they shall die?  BUCKINGHAM. Give me some little breath, some pause, dear lord, Before I positively speak in this. I will resolve you herein presently.  [_Exit._]  CATESBY. [_Aside_.] The King is angry. See, he gnaws his lip.  KING RICHARD. [_Aside_.] I will converse with iron-witted fools And unrespective boys; none are for me That look into me with considerate eyes. High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect. Boy!  PAGE. My lord?  KING RICHARD. Know’st thou not any whom corrupting gold Will tempt unto a close exploit of death?  PAGE. I know a discontented gentleman Whose humble means match not his haughty spirit. Gold were as good as twenty orators, And will, no doubt, tempt him to anything.  KING RICHARD. What is his name?  PAGE. His name, my lord, is Tyrrel.  KING RICHARD. I partly know the man. Go, call him hither, boy.  [_Exit Page._]  [_Aside_.] The deep-revolving witty Buckingham No more shall be the neighbour to my counsels. Hath he so long held out with me, untired, And stops he now for breath? Well, be it so.  Enter Stanley.  How now, Lord Stanley, what’s the news?  STANLEY. Know, my loving lord, The Marquess Dorset, as I hear, is fled To Richmond, in the parts where he abides.  KING RICHARD. Come hither, Catesby. Rumour it abroad That Anne my wife is very grievous sick; I will take order for her keeping close. Inquire me out some mean poor gentleman, Whom I will marry straight to Clarence’ daughter. The boy is foolish, and I fear not him. Look how thou dream’st! I say again, give out That Anne, my Queen, is sick and like to die. About it, for it stands me much upon To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me.  [_Exit Catesby._]  I must be married to my brother’s daughter, Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass. Murder her brothers, and then marry her— Uncertain way of gain! But I am in So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin. Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.  Enter Tyrrel.  Is thy name Tyrrel?  TYRREL. James Tyrrel, and your most obedient subject.  KING RICHARD. Art thou indeed?  TYRREL. Prove me, my gracious lord.  KING RICHARD. Dar’st thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?  TYRREL. Please you. But I had rather kill two enemies.  KING RICHARD. Why then thou hast it; two deep enemies, Foes to my rest, and my sweet sleep’s disturbers, Are they that I would have thee deal upon. Tyrell, I mean those bastards in the Tower.  TYRREL. Let me have open means to come to them, And soon I’ll rid you from the fear of them.  KING RICHARD. Thou sing’st sweet music. Hark, come hither, Tyrrel. Go, by this token. Rise, and lend thine ear. [_Whispers_.] There is no more but so. Say it is done, And I will love thee, and prefer thee for it.  TYRREL. I will dispatch it straight.  [_Exit._]  Enter Buckingham.  BUCKINGHAM. My lord, I have considered in my mind The late request that you did sound me in.  KING RICHARD. Well, let that rest. Dorset is fled to Richmond.  BUCKINGHAM. I hear the news, my lord.  KING RICHARD. Stanley, he is your wife’s son. Well, look unto it.  BUCKINGHAM. My lord, I claim the gift, my due by promise, For which your honour and your faith is pawned: Th’ earldom of Hereford, and the movables Which you have promised I shall possess.  KING RICHARD. Stanley, look to your wife. If she convey Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it.  BUCKINGHAM. What says your Highness to my just request?  KING RICHARD. I do remember me, Henry the Sixth Did prophesy that Richmond should be King, When Richmond was a little peevish boy. A king perhaps—  BUCKINGHAM. My lord—  KING RICHARD. How chance the prophet could not at that time Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?  BUCKINGHAM. My lord, your promise for the earldom—  KING RICHARD. Richmond! When last I was at Exeter, The Mayor in courtesy showed me the castle And called it Rougemount, at which name I started, Because a bard of Ireland told me once I should not live long after I saw Richmond.  BUCKINGHAM. My lord—  KING RICHARD. Ay, what’s o’clock?  BUCKINGHAM. I am thus bold to put your Grace in mind Of what you promised me.  KING RICHARD. Well, but what’s o’clock?  BUCKINGHAM. Upon the stroke of ten.  KING RICHARD. Well, let it strike.  BUCKINGHAM. Why let it strike?  KING RICHARD. Because that, like a jack, thou keep’st the stroke Betwixt thy begging and my meditation. I am not in the giving vein today.  BUCKINGHAM. Why then, resolve me whether you will or no.  KING RICHARD. Thou troublest me; I am not in the vein.  [_Exit followed by all save Buckingham._]  BUCKINGHAM. And is it thus? Repays he my deep service With such contempt? Made I him King for this? O, let me think on Hastings, and be gone To Brecknock while my fearful head is on!  [_Exit._]  SCENE III. London. Another Room in the Palace  Enter Tyrrel.  TYRREL. The tyrannous and bloody act is done, The most arch deed of piteous massacre That ever yet this land was guilty of. Dighton and Forrest, who I did suborn To do this piece of ruthless butchery, Albeit they were fleshed villains, bloody dogs, Melted with tenderness and mild compassion, Wept like two children in their deaths’ sad story. “O, thus,” quoth Dighton, “lay the gentle babes;” “Thus, thus,” quoth Forrest, “girdling one another Within their alabaster innocent arms. Their lips were four red roses on a stalk, And in their summer beauty kissed each other. A book of prayers on their pillow lay, Which once,” quoth Forrest, “almost changed my mind. But, O, the devil—” There the villain stopped; When Dighton thus told on: “We smothered The most replenished sweet work of nature That from the prime creation e’er she framed.” Hence both are gone with conscience and remorse They could not speak; and so I left them both To bear this tidings to the bloody King.  Enter King Richard.  And here he comes. All health, my sovereign lord.  KING RICHARD. Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?  TYRREL. If to have done the thing you gave in charge Beget your happiness, be happy then, For it is done.  KING RICHARD. But didst thou see them dead?  TYRREL. I did, my lord.  KING RICHARD. And buried, gentle Tyrrel?  TYRREL. The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them, But where, to say the truth, I do not know.  KING RICHARD. Come to me, Tyrrel, soon, at after-supper, When thou shalt tell the process of their death. Meantime, but think how I may do thee good, And be inheritor of thy desire. Farewell till then.  TYRREL. I humbly take my leave.  [_Exit._]  KING RICHARD. The son of Clarence have I pent up close; His daughter meanly have I matched in marriage; The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham’s bosom, And Anne my wife hath bid the world good night. Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims At young Elizabeth, my brother’s daughter, And by that knot looks proudly on the crown, To her go I, a jolly thriving wooer.  Enter Ratcliffe.  RATCLIFFE. My lord!  KING RICHARD. Good or bad news, that thou com’st in so bluntly?  RATCLIFFE. Bad news, my lord. Morton is fled to Richmond, And Buckingham, backed with the hardy Welshmen, Is in the field, and still his power increaseth.  KING RICHARD. Ely with Richmond troubles me more near Than Buckingham and his rash-levied strength. Come, I have learned that fearful commenting Is leaden servitor to dull delay; Delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary; Then fiery expedition be my wing, Jove’s Mercury, and herald for a king! Go, muster men. My counsel is my shield. We must be brief when traitors brave the field.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IV. London. Before the Palace  Enter old Queen Margaret.  QUEEN MARGARET. So now prosperity begins to mellow, And drop into the rotten mouth of death. Here in these confines slily have I lurked To watch the waning of mine enemies. A dire induction am I witness to, And will to France, hoping the consequence Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical. Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret. Who comes here?  [_Retires._]  Enter Duchess of York and Queen Elizabeth.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Ah, my poor Princes! Ah, my tender babes, My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets! If yet your gentle souls fly in the air And be not fixed in doom perpetual, Hover about me with your airy wings And hear your mother’s lamentation.  QUEEN MARGARET. [_Aside_.] Hover about her; say that right for right Hath dimmed your infant morn to aged night.  DUCHESS. So many miseries have crazed my voice That my woe-wearied tongue is still and mute. Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?  QUEEN MARGARET. [_Aside_.] Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet; Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle lambs, And throw them in the entrails of the wolf? When didst Thou sleep when such a deed was done?  QUEEN MARGARET. [_Aside_.] When holy Harry died, and my sweet son.  DUCHESS. Dead life, blind sight, poor mortal living ghost, Woe’s scene, world’s shame, grave’s due by life usurped, Brief abstract and record of tedious days, Rest thy unrest on England’s lawful earth, [_Sitting_.] Unlawfully made drunk with innocent blood.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Ah, that thou wouldst as soon afford a grave As thou canst yield a melancholy seat, Then would I hide my bones, not rest them here. [_Sitting_.] Ah, who hath any cause to mourn but we?  QUEEN MARGARET.  [_Coming forward._]  If ancient sorrow be most reverend, Give mine the benefit of seigniory, And let my griefs frown on the upper hand. If sorrow can admit society,  [_Sitting down with them._]  Tell o’er your woes again by viewing mine. I had an Edward, till a Richard killed him; I had a husband, till a Richard killed him. Thou hadst an Edward, till a Richard killed him; Thou hadst a Richard, till a Richard killed him.  DUCHESS. I had a Richard too, and thou didst kill him; I had a Rutland too; thou holp’st to kill him.  QUEEN MARGARET. Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard killed him. From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death: That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes, To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood; That excellent grand tyrant of the earth, That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls; That foul defacer of God’s handiwork Thy womb let loose to chase us to our graves. O upright, just, and true-disposing God, How do I thank thee that this carnal cur Preys on the issue of his mother’s body, And makes her pew-fellow with others’ moan!  DUCHESS. O Harry’s wife, triumph not in my woes! God witness with me, I have wept for thine.  QUEEN MARGARET. Bear with me. I am hungry for revenge, And now I cloy me with beholding it. Thy Edward he is dead, that killed my Edward; The other Edward dead, to quit my Edward; Young York, he is but boot, because both they Matched not the high perfection of my loss. Thy Clarence he is dead that stabbed my Edward; And the beholders of this frantic play, Th’ adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey, Untimely smothered in their dusky graves. Richard yet lives, hell’s black intelligencer, Only reserved their factor to buy souls And send them thither. But at hand, at hand Ensues his piteous and unpitied end. Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray, To have him suddenly conveyed from hence. Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I pray, That I may live to say “The dog is dead.”  QUEEN ELIZABETH. O, thou didst prophesy the time would come That I should wish for thee to help me curse That bottled spider, that foul bunch-backed toad!  QUEEN MARGARET. I called thee then, vain flourish of my fortune; I called thee then, poor shadow, painted queen, The presentation of but what I was, The flattering index of a direful pageant; One heaved a-high to be hurled down below, A mother only mocked with two fair babes; A dream of what thou wast; a garish flag, To be the aim of every dangerous shot; A sign of dignity, a breath, a bubble; A queen in jest, only to fill the scene. Where is thy husband now? Where be thy brothers? Where are thy two sons? Wherein dost thou joy? Who sues, and kneels, and says, “God save the Queen?” Where be the bending peers that flattered thee? Where be the thronging troops that followed thee? Decline all this, and see what now thou art: For happy wife, a most distressed widow; For joyful mother, one that wails the name; For one being sued to, one that humbly sues; For Queen, a very caitiff crowned with care; For she that scorned at me, now scorned of me; For she being feared of all, now fearing one; For she commanding all, obeyed of none. Thus hath the course of justice wheeled about And left thee but a very prey to time, Having no more but thought of what thou wast To torture thee the more, being what thou art. Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow? Now thy proud neck bears half my burdened yoke, From which even here I slip my weary head, And leave the burden of it all on thee. Farewell, York’s wife, and Queen of sad mischance. These English woes shall make me smile in France.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. O thou well skilled in curses, stay awhile, And teach me how to curse mine enemies.  QUEEN MARGARET. Forbear to sleep the night, and fast the days; Compare dead happiness with living woe; Think that thy babes were sweeter than they were, And he that slew them fouler than he is. Bettering thy loss makes the bad-causer worse. Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. My words are dull. O, quicken them with thine!  QUEEN MARGARET. Thy woes will make them sharp and pierce like mine.  [_Exit._]  DUCHESS. Why should calamity be full of words?  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Windy attorneys to their clients’ woes, Airy succeeders of intestate joys, Poor breathing orators of miseries, Let them have scope, though what they do impart Help nothing else, yet do they ease the heart.  DUCHESS. If so, then be not tongue-tied. Go with me, And in the breath of bitter words let’s smother My damned son, that thy two sweet sons smothered.  [_A trumpet sounds._]  The trumpet sounds. Be copious in exclaims.  Enter King Richard and his Train, including Catesby, marching.  KING RICHARD. Who intercepts me in my expedition?  DUCHESS. O, she that might have intercepted thee, By strangling thee in her accursed womb, From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Hid’st thou that forehead with a golden crown Where should be branded, if that right were right, The slaughter of the Prince that owed that crown, And the dire death of my poor sons and brothers? Tell me, thou villain-slave, where are my children?  DUCHESS. Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother Clarence, And little Ned Plantagenet his son?  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Where is the gentle Rivers, Vaughan, Grey?  DUCHESS. Where is kind Hastings?  KING RICHARD. A flourish, trumpets! Strike alarum, drums! Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women Rail on the Lord’s anointed. Strike, I say!  [_Flourish. Alarums._]  Either be patient and entreat me fair, Or with the clamorous report of war Thus will I drown your exclamations.  DUCHESS. Art thou my son?  KING RICHARD. Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself.  DUCHESS. Then patiently hear my impatience.  KING RICHARD. Madam, I have a touch of your condition, That cannot brook the accent of reproof.  DUCHESS. O, let me speak!  KING RICHARD. Do then, but I’ll not hear.  DUCHESS. I will be mild and gentle in my words.  KING RICHARD. And brief, good mother, for I am in haste.  DUCHESS. Art thou so hasty? I have stayed for thee, God knows, in torment and in agony.  KING RICHARD. And came I not at last to comfort you?  DUCHESS. No, by the Holy Rood, thou know’st it well Thou cam’st on earth to make the earth my hell. A grievous burden was thy birth to me; Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy; Thy school-days frightful, desp’rate, wild, and furious; Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous; Thy age confirmed, proud, subtle, sly, and bloody, More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred. What comfortable hour canst thou name That ever graced me with thy company?  KING RICHARD. Faith, none but Humphrey Hower, that called your Grace To breakfast once, forth of my company. If I be so disgracious in your eye, Let me march on and not offend you, madam. Strike up the drum.  DUCHESS. I prithee, hear me speak.  KING RICHARD. You speak too bitterly.  DUCHESS. Hear me a word, For I shall never speak to thee again.  KING RICHARD. So.  DUCHESS. Either thou wilt die by God’s just ordinance Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror, Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish And never more behold thy face again. Therefore take with thee my most grievous curse, Which in the day of battle tire thee more Than all the complete armour that thou wear’st. My prayers on the adverse party fight; And there the little souls of Edward’s children Whisper the spirits of thine enemies And promise them success and victory. Bloody thou art; bloody will be thy end. Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.  [_Exit._]  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curse Abides in me, I say amen to her.  KING RICHARD. Stay, madam, I must talk a word with you.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. I have no more sons of the royal blood For thee to slaughter. For my daughters, Richard, They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens, And therefore level not to hit their lives.  KING RICHARD. You have a daughter called Elizabeth, Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. And must she die for this? O, let her live, And I’ll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty, Slander myself as false to Edward’s bed, Throw over her the veil of infamy. So she may live unscarred of bleeding slaughter, I will confess she was not Edward’s daughter.  KING RICHARD. Wrong not her birth; she is a royal princess.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. To save her life I’ll say she is not so.  KING RICHARD. Her life is safest only in her birth.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. And only in that safety died her brothers.  KING RICHARD. Lo, at their births good stars were opposite.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. No, to their lives ill friends were contrary.  KING RICHARD. All unavoided is the doom of destiny.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. True, when avoided grace makes destiny. My babes were destined to a fairer death, If grace had blessed thee with a fairer life.  KING RICHARD. You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Cousins, indeed, and by their uncle cozened Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life. Whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts, Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction. No doubt the murd’rous knife was dull and blunt Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart, To revel in the entrails of my lambs. But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame, My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys Till that my nails were anchored in thine eyes, And I, in such a desp’rate bay of death, Like a poor bark of sails and tackling reft, Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.  KING RICHARD. Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise And dangerous success of bloody wars, As I intend more good to you and yours Than ever you or yours by me were harmed!  QUEEN ELIZABETH. What good is covered with the face of heaven, To be discovered, that can do me good?  KING RICHARD. Th’ advancement of your children, gentle lady.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads.  KING RICHARD. Unto the dignity and height of fortune, The high imperial type of this earth’s glory.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Flatter my sorrows with report of it. Tell me what state, what dignity, what honour, Canst thou demise to any child of mine?  KING RICHARD. Even all I have—ay, and myself and all Will I withal endow a child of thine; So in the Lethe of thy angry soul Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs Which thou supposest I have done to thee.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Be brief, lest that the process of thy kindness Last longer telling than thy kindness’ date.  KING RICHARD. Then know, that from my soul I love thy daughter.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. My daughter’s mother thinks it with her soul.  KING RICHARD. What do you think?  QUEEN ELIZABETH. That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul. So from thy soul’s love didst thou love her brothers, And from my heart’s love I do thank thee for it.  KING RICHARD. Be not so hasty to confound my meaning. I mean that with my soul I love thy daughter, And do intend to make her Queen of England.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Well, then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?  KING RICHARD. Even he that makes her Queen. Who else should be?  QUEEN ELIZABETH. What, thou?  KING RICHARD. Even so. How think you of it?  QUEEN ELIZABETH. How canst thou woo her?  KING RICHARD. That would I learn of you, As one being best acquainted with her humour.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. And wilt thou learn of me?  KING RICHARD. Madam, with all my heart.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Send to her, by the man that slew her brothers, A pair of bleeding hearts; thereon engrave “Edward” and “York.” Then haply will she weep. Therefore present to her—as sometimes Margaret Did to thy father, steeped in Rutland’s blood— A handkerchief, which, say to her, did drain The purple sap from her sweet brothers’ body, And bid her wipe her weeping eyes withal. If this inducement move her not to love, Send her a letter of thy noble deeds; Tell her thou mad’st away her uncle Clarence, Her uncle Rivers, ay, and for her sake Mad’st quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.  KING RICHARD. You mock me, madam; this is not the way To win your daughter.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. There is no other way, Unless thou couldst put on some other shape, And not be Richard, that hath done all this.  KING RICHARD. Say that I did all this for love of her?  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee, Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.  KING RICHARD. Look what is done cannot be now amended. Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes, Which after-hours gives leisure to repent. If I did take the kingdom from your sons, To make amends I’ll give it to your daughter. If I have killed the issue of your womb, To quicken your increase I will beget Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter. A grandam’s name is little less in love Than is the doting title of a mother; They are as children but one step below, Even of your mettle, of your very blood; Of all one pain, save for a night of groans Endured of her, for whom you bid like sorrow. Your children were vexation to your youth, But mine shall be a comfort to your age. The loss you have is but a son being King, And by that loss your daughter is made Queen. I cannot make you what amends I would; Therefore accept such kindness as I can. Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul Leads discontented steps in foreign soil, This fair alliance quickly shall call home To high promotions and great dignity. The King, that calls your beauteous daughter wife, Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother; Again shall you be mother to a king, And all the ruins of distressful times Repaired with double riches of content. What, we have many goodly days to see. The liquid drops of tears that you have shed Shall come again, transformed to orient pearl, Advantaging their loan with interest Of ten times double gain of happiness. Go then, my mother, to thy daughter go. Make bold her bashful years with your experience; Prepare her ears to hear a wooer’s tale; Put in her tender heart th’ aspiring flame Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the Princess With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys, And when this arm of mine hath chastised The petty rebel, dull-brained Buckingham, Bound with triumphant garlands will I come And lead thy daughter to a conqueror’s bed; To whom I will retail my conquest won, And she shall be sole victoress, Caesar’s Caesar.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. What were I best to say? Her father’s brother Would be her lord? Or shall I say her uncle? Or he that slew her brothers and her uncles? Under what title shall I woo for thee, That God, the law, my honour, and her love Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?  KING RICHARD. Infer fair England’s peace by this alliance.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Which she shall purchase with still-lasting war.  KING RICHARD. Tell her the King, that may command, entreats.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. That at her hands, which the King’s King forbids.  KING RICHARD. Say she shall be a high and mighty queen.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. To vail the title, as her mother doth.  KING RICHARD. Say I will love her everlastingly.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. But how long shall that title “ever” last?  KING RICHARD. Sweetly in force unto her fair life’s end.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. But how long fairly shall her sweet life last?  KING RICHARD. As long as heaven and nature lengthens it.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. As long as hell and Richard likes of it.  KING RICHARD. Say I, her sovereign, am her subject low.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. But she, your subject, loathes such sovereignty.  KING RICHARD. Be eloquent in my behalf to her.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. An honest tale speeds best being plainly told.  KING RICHARD. Then plainly to her tell my loving tale.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.  KING RICHARD. Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. O no, my reasons are too deep and dead— Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their graves.  KING RICHARD. Harp not on that string, madam; that is past.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings break.  KING RICHARD. Now, by my George, my Garter, and my crown—  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Profaned, dishonoured, and the third usurped.  KING RICHARD. I swear—  QUEEN ELIZABETH. By nothing, for this is no oath. Thy George, profaned, hath lost his lordly honour; Thy Garter, blemished, pawned his knightly virtue; Thy crown, usurped, disgraced his kingly glory. If something thou wouldst swear to be believed, Swear then by something that thou hast not wronged.  KING RICHARD. Now, by the world—  QUEEN ELIZABETH. ’Tis full of thy foul wrongs.  KING RICHARD. My father’s death—  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Thy life hath that dishonoured.  KING RICHARD. Then, by myself—  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Thyself is self-misused.  KING RICHARD. Why, then, by God—  QUEEN ELIZABETH. God’s wrong is most of all. If thou didst fear to break an oath with Him, The unity the King my husband made Thou hadst not broken, nor my brothers died. If thou hadst feared to break an oath by Him, Th’ imperial metal circling now thy head Had graced the tender temples of my child, And both the Princes had been breathing here, Which now, two tender bedfellows for dust, Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms. What canst thou swear by now?  KING RICHARD. The time to come.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. That thou hast wronged in the time o’erpast; For I myself have many tears to wash Hereafter time, for time past wronged by thee. The children live whose fathers thou hast slaughtered, Ungoverned youth, to wail it in their age; The parents live whose children thou hast butchered, Old barren plants, to wail it with their age. Swear not by time to come, for that thou hast Misused ere used, by times ill-used o’erpast.  KING RICHARD. As I intend to prosper and repent, So thrive I in my dangerous affairs Of hostile arms! Myself myself confound! Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours! Day, yield me not thy light, nor, night, thy rest! Be opposite all planets of good luck To my proceeding if with dear heart’s love, Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts, I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter. In her consists my happiness and thine; Without her follows to myself and thee, Herself, the land, and many a Christian soul, Death, desolation, ruin, and decay. It cannot be avoided but by this; It will not be avoided but by this. Therefore, dear mother—I must call you so— Be the attorney of my love to her; Plead what I will be, not what I have been; Not my deserts, but what I will deserve. Urge the necessity and state of times, And be not peevish found in great designs.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?  KING RICHARD. Ay, if the devil tempt you to do good.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Shall I forget myself to be myself?  KING RICHARD. Ay, if your self’s remembrance wrong yourself.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Yet thou didst kill my children.  KING RICHARD. But in your daughter’s womb I bury them, Where, in that nest of spicery, they will breed Selves of themselves, to your recomforture.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?  KING RICHARD. And be a happy mother by the deed.  QUEEN ELIZABETH. I go. Write to me very shortly, And you shall understand from me her mind.  KING RICHARD. Bear her my true love’s kiss; and so, farewell.  [_Kissing her. Exit Queen Elizabeth._]  Relenting fool, and shallow, changing woman!  Enter Ratcliffe.  How now, what news?  RATCLIFFE. Most mighty sovereign, on the western coast Rideth a puissant navy; to our shores Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends, Unarmed, and unresolved to beat them back. ’Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral; And there they hull, expecting but the aid Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore.  KING RICHARD. Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of Norfolk. Ratcliffe, thyself, or Catesby. Where is he?  CATESBY. Here, my good lord.  KING RICHARD. Catesby, fly to the Duke.  CATESBY. I will my lord, with all convenient haste.  KING RICHARD. Ratcliffe, come hither. Post to Salisbury. When thou com’st thither— [_To Catesby._] Dull, unmindful villain, Why stay’st thou here, and go’st not to the Duke?  CATESBY. First, mighty liege, tell me your Highness’ pleasure, What from your Grace I shall deliver to him.  KING RICHARD. O, true, good Catesby. Bid him levy straight The greatest strength and power that he can make, And meet me suddenly at Salisbury.  CATESBY. I go.  [_Exit._]  RATCLIFFE. What, may it please you, shall I do at Salisbury?  KING RICHARD. Why, what wouldst thou do there before I go?  RATCLIFFE. Your Highness told me I should post before.  KING RICHARD. My mind is changed.  Enter Stanley Earl of Derby.  Stanley, what news with you?  STANLEY. None good, my liege, to please you with the hearing; Nor none so bad but well may be reported.  KING RICHARD. Hoyday, a riddle! Neither good nor bad. What need’st thou run so many miles about When thou mayst tell thy tale the nearest way? Once more, what news?  STANLEY. Richmond is on the seas.  KING RICHARD. There let him sink, and be the seas on him! White-livered runagate, what doth he there?  STANLEY. I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess.  KING RICHARD. Well, as you guess?  STANLEY. Stirred up by Dorset, Buckingham, and Morton, He makes for England, here to claim the crown.  KING RICHARD. Is the chair empty? Is the sword unswayed? Is the King dead? The empire unpossessed? What heir of York is there alive but we? And who is England’s King but great York’s heir? Then tell me, what makes he upon the seas?  STANLEY. Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.  KING RICHARD. Unless for that he comes to be your liege, You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes. Thou wilt revolt and fly to him, I fear.  STANLEY. No, my good lord; therefore mistrust me not.  KING RICHARD. Where is thy power, then, to beat him back? Where be thy tenants and thy followers? Are they not now upon the western shore, Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships?  STANLEY. No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.  KING RICHARD. Cold friends to me. What do they in the north, When they should serve their sovereign in the west?  STANLEY. They have not been commanded, mighty King. Pleaseth your Majesty to give me leave, I’ll muster up my friends, and meet your Grace Where and what time your Majesty shall please.  KING RICHARD. Ay, ay, thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond. But I’ll not trust thee.  STANLEY. Most mighty sovereign, You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful. I never was nor never will be false.  KING RICHARD. Go then, and muster men, but leave behind Your son George Stanley. Look your heart be firm, Or else his head’s assurance is but frail.  STANLEY. So deal with him as I prove true to you.  [_Exit._]  Enter a Messenger.  MESSENGER. My gracious sovereign, now in Devonshire, As I by friends am well advertised, Sir Edward Courtney, and the haughty prelate, Bishop of Exeter, his elder brother, With many more confederates, are in arms.  Enter another Messenger.  SECOND MESSENGER. In Kent, my liege, the Guilfords are in arms, And every hour more competitors Flock to the rebels, and their power grows strong.  Enter another Messenger.  THIRD MESSENGER. My lord, the army of great Buckingham—  KING RICHARD. Out on you, owls! Nothing but songs of death?  [_He strikes him._]  There, take thou that till thou bring better news.  THIRD MESSENGER. The news I have to tell your Majesty Is, that by sudden floods and fall of waters, Buckingham’s army is dispersed and scattered, And he himself wandered away alone, No man knows whither.  KING RICHARD. I cry thee mercy. There is my purse to cure that blow of thine. Hath any well-advised friend proclaimed Reward to him that brings the traitor in?  THIRD MESSENGER. Such proclamation hath been made, my lord.  Enter another Messenger.  FOURTH MESSENGER. Sir Thomas Lovell and Lord Marquess Dorset, ’Tis said, my liege, in Yorkshire are in arms. But this good comfort bring I to your Highness: The Breton navy is dispersed by tempest. Richmond, in Dorsetshire, sent out a boat Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks If they were his assistants, yea or no?— Who answered him they came from Buckingham Upon his party. He, mistrusting them, Hoised sail, and made his course again for Brittany.  KING RICHARD. March on, march on, since we are up in arms, If not to fight with foreign enemies, Yet to beat down these rebels here at home.  Enter Catesby.  CATESBY. My liege, the Duke of Buckingham is taken. That is the best news. That the Earl of Richmond Is with a mighty power landed at Milford Is colder tidings, yet they must be told.  KING RICHARD. Away towards Salisbury! While we reason here A royal battle might be won and lost. Someone take order Buckingham be brought To Salisbury; the rest march on with me.  [_Flourish. Exeunt._]  SCENE V. A Room in Lord Stanley’s house  Enter Stanley Earl of Derby and Sir Christopher Urswick.  STANLEY. Sir Christopher, tell Richmond this from me: That in the sty of the most deadly boar My son George Stanley is franked up in hold; If I revolt, off goes young George’s head; The fear of that holds off my present aid. So get thee gone. Commend me to thy lord; Withal say that the Queen hath heartily consented He should espouse Elizabeth her daughter. But tell me, where is princely Richmond now?  CHRISTOPHER. At Pembroke, or at Ha’rfordwest in Wales.  STANLEY. What men of name resort to him?  CHRISTOPHER. Sir Walter Herbert, a renowned soldier; Sir Gilbert Talbot, Sir William Stanley, Oxford, redoubted Pembroke, Sir James Blunt, And Rice ap Thomas, with a valiant crew, And many other of great name and worth; And towards London do they bend their power, If by the way they be not fought withal.  STANLEY. Well, hie thee to thy lord; I kiss his hand. My letter will resolve him of my mind. Farewell.  [_Exeunt._]
  ACT V  SCENE I. Salisbury. An open place
Enter Sheriff and Halberds, with Buckingham, led to execution.  BUCKINGHAM. Will not King Richard let me speak with him?  SHERIFF. No, my good lord; therefore be patient.  BUCKINGHAM. Hastings, and Edward’s children, Grey, and Rivers, Holy King Henry, and thy fair son Edward, Vaughan, and all that have miscarried By underhand, corrupted foul injustice, If that your moody discontented souls Do through the clouds behold this present hour, Even for revenge mock my destruction. This is All-Souls’ day, fellow, is it not?  SHERIFF. It is.  BUCKINGHAM. Why, then All-Souls’ day is my body’s doomsday. This is the day which, in King Edward’s time, I wished might fall on me when I was found False to his children and his wife’s allies. This is the day wherein I wished to fall By the false faith of him whom most I trusted. This, this All-Souls’ day to my fearful soul Is the determined respite of my wrongs. That high All-Seer which I dallied with Hath turned my feigned prayer on my head And given in earnest what I begged in jest. Thus doth He force the swords of wicked men To turn their own points in their masters’ bosoms. Thus Margaret’s curse falls heavy on my neck: “When he,” quoth she, “shall split thy heart with sorrow, Remember Margaret was a prophetess.” Come lead me, officers, to the block of shame; Wrong hath but wrong, and blame the due of blame.  [_Exit with Officers._]  SCENE II. Plain near Tamworth  Enter Richmond, Oxford, Blunt, Herbert, and others, with drum and colours.  RICHMOND. Fellows in arms, and my most loving friends, Bruised underneath the yoke of tyranny, Thus far into the bowels of the land Have we marched on without impediment; And here receive we from our father Stanley Lines of fair comfort and encouragement. The wretched, bloody, and usurping boar, That spoiled your summer fields and fruitful vines, Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough In your embowelled bosoms—this foul swine Is now even in the centre of this isle, Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn. From Tamworth thither is but one day’s march. In God’s name, cheerly on, courageous friends, To reap the harvest of perpetual peace By this one bloody trial of sharp war.  OXFORD. Every man’s conscience is a thousand men, To fight against that guilty homicide.  HERBERT. I doubt not but his friends will turn to us.  BLUNT. He hath no friends but what are friends for fear, Which in his dearest need will fly from him.  RICHMOND. All for our vantage. Then in God’s name, march. True hope is swift, and flies with swallow’s wings; Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. Bosworth Field  Enter King Richard in arms, with Norfolk, Ratcliffe  and the Earl of Surrey with others.  KING RICHARD. Here pitch our tent, even here in Bosworth field. My Lord of Surrey, why look you so sad?  SURREY. My heart is ten times lighter than my looks.  KING RICHARD. My lord of Norfolk.  NORFOLK. Here, most gracious liege.  KING RICHARD. Norfolk, we must have knocks, ha, must we not?  NORFOLK. We must both give and take, my loving lord.  KING RICHARD. Up with my tent! Here will I lie tonight. But where tomorrow? Well, all’s one for that. Who hath descried the number of the traitors?  NORFOLK. Six or seven thousand is their utmost power.  KING RICHARD. Why, our battalia trebles that account. Besides, the King’s name is a tower of strength Which they upon the adverse faction want. Up with the tent! Come, noble gentlemen, Let us survey the vantage of the ground. Call for some men of sound direction; Let’s lack no discipline, make no delay, For, lords, tomorrow is a busy day.  [_The tent is now ready. Exeunt._]  Enter Richmond, Sir William Brandon, Oxford, Herbert, Blunt, and others who pitch Richmond’s tent.  RICHMOND. The weary sun hath made a golden set, And by the bright track of his fiery car Gives token of a goodly day tomorrow. Sir William Brandon, you shall bear my standard. Give me some ink and paper in my tent; I’ll draw the form and model of our battle, Limit each leader to his several charge, And part in just proportion our small power. My Lord of Oxford, you, Sir William Brandon, And you, Sir Walter Herbert, stay with me. The Earl of Pembroke keeps his regiment.— Good Captain Blunt, bear my goodnight to him, And by the second hour in the morning Desire the Earl to see me in my tent. Yet one thing more, good captain, do for me. Where is Lord Stanley quartered, do you know?  BLUNT. Unless I have mista’en his colours much, Which well I am assured I have not done, His regiment lies half a mile at least South from the mighty power of the King.  RICHMOND. If without peril it be possible, Sweet Blunt, make some good means to speak with him, And give him from me this most needful note.  BLUNT. Upon my life, my lord, I’ll undertake it; And so God give you quiet rest tonight.  RICHMOND. Good night, good Captain Blunt.  [_Exit Blunt._]  Come, gentlemen, Let us consult upon tomorrow’s business; Into my tent. The dew is raw and cold.  [_Richmond, Brandon Herbert, and  Oxford withdraw into the tent. The others exeunt._]  Enter to his tent, King Richard, Ratcliffe, Norfolk and Catesby with Soldiers.  KING RICHARD. What is’t o’clock?  CATESBY. It’s supper time, my lord. It’s nine o’clock.  KING RICHARD. I will not sup tonight. Give me some ink and paper. What, is my beaver easier than it was? And all my armour laid into my tent?  CATESBY. It is, my liege, and all things are in readiness.  KING RICHARD. Good Norfolk, hie thee to thy charge; Use careful watch; choose trusty sentinels.  NORFOLK. I go, my lord.  KING RICHARD. Stir with the lark tomorrow, gentle Norfolk.  NORFOLK. I warrant you, my lord.  [_Exit._]  KING RICHARD. Catesby!  CATESBY. My lord?  KING RICHARD. Send out a pursuivant-at-arms To Stanley’s regiment. Bid him bring his power Before sunrising, lest his son George fall Into the blind cave of eternal night.  [_Exit Catesby._]  Fill me a bowl of wine. Give me a watch. Saddle white Surrey for the field tomorrow. Look that my staves be sound, and not too heavy. Ratcliffe!  RATCLIFFE. My lord?  KING RICHARD. Saw’st thou the melancholy Lord Northumberland?  RATCLIFFE. Thomas the Earl of Surrey and himself, Much about cockshut time, from troop to troop Went through the army, cheering up the soldiers.  KING RICHARD. So, I am satisfied. Give me a bowl of wine. I have not that alacrity of spirit Nor cheer of mind that I was wont to have. Set it down. Is ink and paper ready?  RATCLIFFE. It is, my lord.  KING RICHARD. Bid my guard watch; leave me. Ratcliffe, about the mid of night come to my tent And help to arm me. Leave me, I say.  [_Exit Ratcliffe. Richard withdraws into his tent; attendant soldiers guard it_.]  Enter Stanley Earl of Derby to Richmond in his tent.  STANLEY. Fortune and victory sit on thy helm!  RICHMOND. All comfort that the dark night can afford Be to thy person, noble father-in-law. Tell me, how fares our loving mother?  STANLEY. I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother, Who prays continually for Richmond’s good. So much for that. The silent hours steal on, And flaky darkness breaks within the east. In brief, for so the season bids us be, Prepare thy battle early in the morning, And put thy fortune to the arbitrement Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war. I, as I may—that which I would I cannot— With best advantage will deceive the time, And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms. But on thy side I may not be too forward, Lest, being seen, thy brother, tender George, Be executed in his father’s sight. Farewell; the leisure and the fearful time Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love And ample interchange of sweet discourse, Which so-long-sundered friends should dwell upon. God give us leisure for these rites of love! Once more, adieu. Be valiant, and speed well.  RICHMOND. Good lords, conduct him to his regiment. I’ll strive with troubled thoughts to take a nap, Lest leaden slumber peise me down tomorrow When I should mount with wings of victory. Once more, good night, kind lords and gentlemen.  [_All but Richmond leave his tent._]  [_Kneels_.] O Thou, whose captain I account myself, Look on my forces with a gracious eye; Put in their hands Thy bruising irons of wrath, That they may crush down with a heavy fall Th’ usurping helmets of our adversaries; Make us Thy ministers of chastisement, That we may praise Thee in the victory. To Thee I do commend my watchful soul Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes. Sleeping and waking, O, defend me still!  [_Sleeps._]  Enter the Ghost of young Prince Edward, son to Harry the Sixth.  GHOST OF EDWARD. [_To King Richard._] Let me sit heavy on thy soul tomorrow. Think how thou stabbed’st me in my prime of youth At Tewksbury; despair therefore, and die! [_To Richmond._] Be cheerful, Richmond, for the wronged souls Of butchered princes fight in thy behalf. King Henry’s issue, Richmond, comforts thee.  [_Exit._]  Enter the Ghost of Henry the Sixth.  GHOST OF HENRY. [_To King Richard._] When I was mortal, my anointed body By thee was punched full of deadly holes. Think on the Tower and me. Despair, and die; Harry the Sixth bids thee despair and die. [_To Richmond._] Virtuous and holy, be thou conqueror. Harry, that prophesied thou shouldst be King, Doth comfort thee in thy sleep. Live, and flourish!  [_Exit._]  Enter the Ghost of Clarence.  GHOST OF CLARENCE. [_To King Richard._] Let me sit heavy in thy soul tomorrow, I, that was washed to death with fulsome wine, Poor Clarence, by thy guile betrayed to death. Tomorrow in the battle think on me, And fall thy edgeless sword. Despair, and die! [_To Richmond._] Thou offspring of the house of Lancaster, The wronged heirs of York do pray for thee. Good angels guard thy battle; live, and flourish.  [_Exit._]  Enter the Ghosts of Rivers, Grey and Vaughan.  GHOST OF RIVERS. [_To King Richard._] Let me sit heavy in thy soul tomorrow, Rivers that died at Pomfret. Despair and die!  GHOST OF GREY. [_To King Richard._] Think upon Grey, and let thy soul despair!  GHOST OF VAUGHAN. [_To King Richard._] Think upon Vaughan, and with guilty fear Let fall thy lance. Despair and die!  ALL THREE. [_To Richmond._] Awake, and think our wrongs in Richard’s bosom Will conquer him. Awake, and win the day.  [_Exeunt._]  Enter the Ghost of Hastings.  GHOST OF HASTINGS. [_To King Richard._] Bloody and guilty, guiltily awake, And in a bloody battle end thy days. Think on Lord Hastings. Despair and die! [_To Richmond._] Quiet untroubled soul, awake, awake. Arm, fight, and conquer for fair England’s sake.  [_Exit._]  Enter the Ghosts of the two young Princes.  GHOSTS OF PRINCES. [_To King Richard._] Dream on thy cousins smothered in the Tower. Let us be lead within thy bosom, Richard, And weigh thee down to ruin, shame, and death; Thy nephews’ souls bid thee despair and die. [_To Richmond._] Sleep, Richmond, sleep in peace, and wake in joy; Good angels guard thee from the boar’s annoy. Live, and beget a happy race of kings; Edward’s unhappy sons do bid thee flourish.  [_Exeunt._]  Enter the Ghost of Lady Anne, his wife.  GHOST OF ANNE. [_To King Richard._] Richard, thy wife, that wretched Anne thy wife, That never slept a quiet hour with thee, Now fills thy sleep with perturbations. Tomorrow in the battle think on me, And fall thy edgeless sword. Despair and die! [_To Richmond._] Thou quiet soul, sleep thou a quiet sleep; Dream of success and happy victory. Thy adversary’s wife doth pray for thee.  [_Exit._]  Enter the Ghost of Buckingham.  GHOST OF BUCKINGHAM. [_To King Richard._] The first was I that helped thee to the crown; The last was I that felt thy tyranny. O, in the battle think on Buckingham, And die in terror of thy guiltiness. Dream on, dream on of bloody deeds and death. Fainting, despair; despairing, yield thy breath. [_To Richmond._] I died for hope ere I could lend thee aid, But cheer thy heart, and be thou not dismayed. God and good angels fight on Richmond’s side; And Richard fall in height of all his pride.  [_Exit._]  [_King Richard starts up out of his dream._]  KING RICHARD. Give me another horse! Bind up my wounds! Have mercy, Jesu!—Soft! I did but dream. O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me! The lights burn blue; it is now dead midnight. Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh. What do I fear? Myself? There’s none else by. Richard loves Richard, that is, I am I. Is there a murderer here? No. Yes, I am. Then fly. What, from myself? Great reason why, Lest I revenge. What, myself upon myself? Alack, I love myself. Wherefore? For any good That I myself have done unto myself? O, no, alas, I rather hate myself For hateful deeds committed by myself. I am a villain. Yet I lie, I am not. Fool, of thyself speak well. Fool, do not flatter. My conscience hath a thousand several tongues, And every tongue brings in a several tale, And every tale condemns me for a villain. Perjury, perjury, in the highest degree; Murder, stern murder, in the direst degree; All several sins, all used in each degree, Throng to the bar, crying all “Guilty, guilty!” I shall despair. There is no creature loves me, And if I die no soul will pity me. And wherefore should they, since that I myself Find in myself no pity to myself? Methought the souls of all that I had murdered Came to my tent, and everyone did threat Tomorrow’s vengeance on the head of Richard.  Enter Ratcliffe.  RATCLIFFE. My lord!  KING RICHARD. Zounds! Who’s there?  RATCLIFFE. Ratcliffe, my lord; ’tis I. The early village cock Hath twice done salutation to the morn; Your friends are up and buckle on their armour.  KING RICHARD. O Ratcliffe, I have dreamed a fearful dream! What think’st thou, will our friends prove all true?  RATCLIFFE. No doubt, my lord.  KING RICHARD. O Ratcliffe, I fear, I fear!  RATCLIFFE. Nay, good my lord, be not afraid of shadows.  KING RICHARD. By the apostle Paul, shadows tonight Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers Armed in proof and led by shallow Richmond. ’Tis not yet near day. Come, go with me. Under our tents I’ll play the eavesdropper, To see if any mean to shrink from me.  [_Exeunt Richard and Ratcliffe._]  Enter the Lords to Richmond in his tent.  LORDS. Good morrow, Richmond.  RICHMOND. Cry mercy, lords and watchful gentlemen, That you have ta’en a tardy sluggard here.  LORDS. How have you slept, my lord?  RICHMOND. The sweetest sleep and fairest-boding dreams That ever entered in a drowsy head Have I since your departure had, my lords. Methought their souls whose bodies Richard murdered Came to my tent and cried on victory. I promise you, my heart is very jocund In the remembrance of so fair a dream. How far into the morning is it, lords?  LORDS. Upon the stroke of four.  RICHMOND. Why, then ’tis time to arm and give direction.  His oration to his soldiers.
More than I have said, loving countrymen, The leisure and enforcement of the time Forbids to dwell upon. Yet remember this: God, and our good cause, fight upon our side; The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls, Like high-reared bulwarks, stand before our faces. Richard except, those whom we fight against Had rather have us win than him they follow. For what is he they follow? Truly, gentlemen, A bloody tyrant and a homicide; One raised in blood, and one in blood established; One that made means to come by what he hath, And slaughtered those that were the means to help him; A base foul stone, made precious by the foil Of England’s chair, where he is falsely set; One that hath ever been God’s enemy. Then, if you fight against God’s enemy, God will, in justice, ward you as his soldiers; If you do sweat to put a tyrant down, You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain; If you do fight against your country’s foes, Your country’s fat shall pay your pains the hire; If you do fight in safeguard of your wives, Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors; If you do free your children from the sword, Your children’s children quits it in your age. Then, in the name of God and all these rights, Advance your standards, draw your willing swords. For me, the ransom of my bold attempt Shall be this cold corpse on the earth’s cold face; But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt The least of you shall share his part thereof. Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully! God, and Saint George! Richmond and victory!  [_Exeunt._]  Enter King Richard, Ratcliffe and Soldiers.  KING RICHARD. What said Northumberland as touching Richmond?  RATCLIFFE. That he was never trained up in arms.  KING RICHARD. He said the truth. And what said Surrey then?  RATCLIFFE. He smiled, and said, “The better for our purpose.”  KING RICHARD. He was in the right, and so indeed it is.  [_The clock striketh._]  Tell the clock there. Give me a calendar. Who saw the sun today?  RATCLIFFE. Not I, my lord.  KING RICHARD. Then he disdains to shine, for by the book He should have braved the east an hour ago. A black day will it be to somebody. Ratcliffe!  RATCLIFFE. My lord?  KING RICHARD. The sun will not be seen today! The sky doth frown and lour upon our army. I would these dewy tears were from the ground. Not shine today? Why, what is that to me More than to Richmond? For the selfsame heaven That frowns on me looks sadly upon him.  Enter Norfolk.  NORFOLK. Arm, arm, my lord. The foe vaunts in the field.  KING RICHARD. Come, bustle, bustle! Caparison my horse. Call up Lord Stanley; bid him bring his power. I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain, And thus my battle shall be ordered: My foreward shall be drawn out all in length, Consisting equally of horse and foot; Our archers shall be placed in the midst. John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey, Shall have the leading of this foot and horse. They thus directed, we will follow In the main battle, whose puissance on either side Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse. This, and Saint George to boot! What think’st thou, Norfolk?  NORFOLK. A good direction, warlike sovereign.  [_He sheweth him a paper._]  This found I on my tent this morning.  KING RICHARD. [_Reads_.] “Jockey of Norfolk, be not too bold. For Dickon thy master is bought and sold.” A thing devised by the enemy. Go, gentlemen, every man unto his charge. Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls; Conscience is but a word that cowards use, Devised at first to keep the strong in awe. Our strong arms be our conscience, swords our law. March on. Join bravely. Let us to it pell-mell, If not to heaven, then hand in hand to hell.  His oration to his army.  What shall I say more than I have inferred? Remember whom you are to cope withal, A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways, A scum of Bretons and base lackey peasants, Whom their o’er-cloyed country vomits forth To desperate adventures and assured destruction. You sleeping safe, they bring to you unrest; You having lands, and blessed with beauteous wives, They would restrain the one, distain the other. And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow, Long kept in Brittany at our mother’s cost? A milksop, one that never in his life Felt so much cold as over-shoes in snow? Let’s whip these stragglers o’er the seas again, Lash hence these overweening rags of France, These famished beggars, weary of their lives, Who, but for dreaming on this fond exploit, For want of means, poor rats, had hanged themselves. If we be conquered, let men conquer us, And not these bastard Bretons, whom our fathers Have in their own land beaten, bobbed, and thumped, And in record left them the heirs of shame. Shall these enjoy our lands? Lie with our wives, Ravish our daughters?  [_Drum afar off._]  Hark, I hear their drum. Fight, gentlemen of England! Fight, bold yeomen! Draw, archers, draw your arrows to the head! Spur your proud horses hard, and ride in blood! Amaze the welkin with your broken staves!  Enter a Messenger.  What says Lord Stanley? Will he bring his power?  MESSENGER. My lord, he doth deny to come.  KING RICHARD. Off with his son George’s head!  NORFOLK. My lord, the enemy is past the marsh. After the battle let George Stanley die.  KING RICHARD. A thousand hearts are great within my bosom. Advance our standards! Set upon our foes! Our ancient word of courage, fair Saint George, Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons! Upon them! Victory sits on our helms.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IV. Another part of the Field  Alarum. Excursions. Enter Norfolk and Soldiers; to him Catesby.  CATESBY. Rescue, my lord of Norfolk, rescue, rescue! The King enacts more wonders than a man, Daring an opposite to every danger. His horse is slain, and all on foot he fights, Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death. Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!  [_Exeunt Norfolk and Soldiers._]  Alarum. Enter King Richard.  KING RICHARD. A horse! A horse! My kingdom for a horse!  CATESBY. Withdraw, my lord; I’ll help you to a horse.  KING RICHARD. Slave, I have set my life upon a cast, And I will stand the hazard of the die. I think there be six Richmonds in the field; Five have I slain today instead of him. A horse! A horse! My kingdom for a horse!  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE V. Another part of the Field  Alarum. Enter King Richard and Richmond. They fight. Richard is slain. Then retreat being sounded. Richmond exits, and Richard’s body is carried off. Flourish. Enter Richmond, Stanley Earl of Derby, bearing the crown, with other Lords and Soldiers.  RICHMOND. God and your arms be praised, victorious friends! The day is ours, the bloody dog is dead.  STANLEY. Courageous Richmond, well hast thou acquit thee! Lo, here, this long-usurped royalty From the dead temples of this bloody wretch Have I plucked off, to grace thy brows withal. Wear it, enjoy it, and make much of it.  RICHMOND. Great God of heaven, say Amen to all! But tell me, is young George Stanley living?  STANLEY. He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester town, Whither, if it please you, we may now withdraw us.  RICHMOND. What men of name are slain on either side?  STANLEY. John, Duke of Norfolk, Walter, Lord Ferrers, Sir Robert Brakenbury, and Sir William Brandon.  RICHMOND. Inter their bodies as becomes their births. Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled That in submission will return to us. And then, as we have ta’en the sacrament, We will unite the white rose and the red. Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction, That long have frowned upon their enmity. What traitor hears me and says not Amen? England hath long been mad, and scarred herself: The brother blindly shed the brother’s blood; The father rashly slaughtered his own son; The son, compelled, been butcher to the sire. All this divided York and Lancaster, Divided in their dire division. O, now let Richmond and Elizabeth, The true succeeders of each royal house, By God’s fair ordinance conjoin together, And let their heirs, God, if Thy will be so, Enrich the time to come with smoothed-faced peace, With smiling plenty, and fair prosperous days. Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord, That would reduce these bloody days again, And make poor England weep in streams of blood. Let them not live to taste this land’s increase, That would with treason wound this fair land’s peace. Now civil wounds are stopped, peace lives again. That she may long live here, God say Amen.

  THE PROLOGUE
 Enter Chorus.  CHORUS. Two households, both alike in dignity, In fair Verona, where we lay our scene, From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. From forth the fatal loins of these two foes A pair of star-cross’d lovers take their life; Whose misadventur’d piteous overthrows Doth with their death bury their parents’ strife. The fearful passage of their death-mark’d love, And the continuance of their parents’ rage, Which, but their children’s end, nought could remove, Is now the two hours’ traffic of our stage; The which, if you with patient ears attend, What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.   [_Exit._]

  ACT IV  SCENE I. Friar Lawrence’s Cell.
 Enter Friar Lawrence and Paris.  FRIAR LAWRENCE. On Thursday, sir? The time is very short.  PARIS. My father Capulet will have it so; And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.  FRIAR LAWRENCE. You say you do not know the lady’s mind. Uneven is the course; I like it not.  PARIS. Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt’s death, And therefore have I little talk’d of love; For Venus smiles not in a house of tears. Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous That she do give her sorrow so much sway; And in his wisdom, hastes our marriage, To stop the inundation of her tears, Which, too much minded by herself alone, May be put from her by society. Now do you know the reason of this haste.  FRIAR LAWRENCE. [_Aside._] I would I knew not why it should be slow’d.— Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.   Enter Juliet.  PARIS. Happily met, my lady and my wife!  JULIET. That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.  PARIS. That may be, must be, love, on Thursday next.  JULIET. What must be shall be.  FRIAR LAWRENCE. That’s a certain text.  PARIS. Come you to make confession to this father?  JULIET. To answer that, I should confess to you.  PARIS. Do not deny to him that you love me.  JULIET. I will confess to you that I love him.  PARIS. So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.  JULIET. If I do so, it will be of more price, Being spoke behind your back than to your face.  PARIS. Poor soul, thy face is much abus’d with tears.  JULIET. The tears have got small victory by that; For it was bad enough before their spite.  PARIS. Thou wrong’st it more than tears with that report.  JULIET. That is no slander, sir, which is a truth, And what I spake, I spake it to my face.  PARIS. Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander’d it.  JULIET. It may be so, for it is not mine own. Are you at leisure, holy father, now, Or shall I come to you at evening mass?  FRIAR LAWRENCE. My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.— My lord, we must entreat the time alone.  PARIS. God shield I should disturb devotion!— Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye, Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.   [_Exit._]  JULIET. O shut the door, and when thou hast done so, Come weep with me, past hope, past cure, past help!  FRIAR LAWRENCE. O Juliet, I already know thy grief; It strains me past the compass of my wits. I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it, On Thursday next be married to this County.  JULIET. Tell me not, Friar, that thou hear’st of this, Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it. If in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help, Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this knife I’ll help it presently. God join’d my heart and Romeo’s, thou our hands; And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo’s seal’d, Shall be the label to another deed, Or my true heart with treacherous revolt Turn to another, this shall slay them both. Therefore, out of thy long-experienc’d time, Give me some present counsel, or behold ’Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife Shall play the empire, arbitrating that Which the commission of thy years and art Could to no issue of true honour bring. Be not so long to speak. I long to die, If what thou speak’st speak not of remedy.  FRIAR LAWRENCE. Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate an execution As that is desperate which we would prevent. If, rather than to marry County Paris Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Then is it likely thou wilt undertake A thing like death to chide away this shame, That cop’st with death himself to scape from it. And if thou dar’st, I’ll give thee remedy.  JULIET. O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris, From off the battlements of yonder tower, Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk Where serpents are. Chain me with roaring bears; Or hide me nightly in a charnel-house, O’er-cover’d quite with dead men’s rattling bones, With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls. Or bid me go into a new-made grave, And hide me with a dead man in his shroud; Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble, And I will do it without fear or doubt, To live an unstain’d wife to my sweet love.  FRIAR LAWRENCE. Hold then. Go home, be merry, give consent To marry Paris. Wednesday is tomorrow; Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone, Let not thy Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber. Take thou this vial, being then in bed, And this distilled liquor drink thou off, When presently through all thy veins shall run A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse Shall keep his native progress, but surcease. No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest, The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade To paly ashes; thy eyes’ windows fall, Like death when he shuts up the day of life. Each part depriv’d of supple government, Shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death. And in this borrow’d likeness of shrunk death Thou shalt continue two and forty hours, And then awake as from a pleasant sleep. Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. Then as the manner of our country is, In thy best robes, uncover’d, on the bier, Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie. In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, And hither shall he come, and he and I Will watch thy waking, and that very night Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. And this shall free thee from this present shame, If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear Abate thy valour in the acting it.  JULIET. Give me, give me! O tell not me of fear!  FRIAR LAWRENCE. Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous In this resolve. I’ll send a friar with speed To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.  JULIET. Love give me strength, and strength shall help afford. Farewell, dear father.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. Hall in Capulet’s House.   Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet, Nurse and Servants.  CAPULET. So many guests invite as here are writ.   [_Exit first Servant._]  Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.  SECOND SERVANT. You shall have none ill, sir; for I’ll try if they can lick their fingers.  CAPULET. How canst thou try them so?  SECOND SERVANT. Marry, sir, ’tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own fingers; therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with me.  CAPULET. Go, begone.   [_Exit second Servant._]  We shall be much unfurnish’d for this time. What, is my daughter gone to Friar Lawrence?  NURSE. Ay, forsooth.  CAPULET. Well, he may chance to do some good on her. A peevish self-will’d harlotry it is.   Enter Juliet.  NURSE. See where she comes from shrift with merry look.  CAPULET. How now, my headstrong. Where have you been gadding?  JULIET. Where I have learnt me to repent the sin Of disobedient opposition To you and your behests; and am enjoin’d By holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here, To beg your pardon. Pardon, I beseech you. Henceforward I am ever rul’d by you.  CAPULET. Send for the County, go tell him of this. I’ll have this knot knit up tomorrow morning.  JULIET. I met the youthful lord at Lawrence’ cell, And gave him what becomed love I might, Not stepping o’er the bounds of modesty.  CAPULET. Why, I am glad on’t. This is well. Stand up. This is as’t should be. Let me see the County. Ay, marry. Go, I say, and fetch him hither. Now afore God, this reverend holy Friar, All our whole city is much bound to him.  JULIET. Nurse, will you go with me into my closet, To help me sort such needful ornaments As you think fit to furnish me tomorrow?  LADY CAPULET. No, not till Thursday. There is time enough.  CAPULET. Go, Nurse, go with her. We’ll to church tomorrow.   [_Exeunt Juliet and Nurse._]  LADY CAPULET. We shall be short in our provision, ’Tis now near night.  CAPULET. Tush, I will stir about, And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife. Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her. I’ll not to bed tonight, let me alone. I’ll play the housewife for this once.—What, ho!— They are all forth: well, I will walk myself To County Paris, to prepare him up Against tomorrow. My heart is wondrous light Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim’d.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. Juliet’s Chamber.   Enter Juliet and Nurse.  JULIET. Ay, those attires are best. But, gentle Nurse, I pray thee leave me to myself tonight; For I have need of many orisons To move the heavens to smile upon my state, Which, well thou know’st, is cross and full of sin.   Enter Lady Capulet.  LADY CAPULET. What, are you busy, ho? Need you my help?  JULIET. No, madam; we have cull’d such necessaries As are behoveful for our state tomorrow. So please you, let me now be left alone, And let the nurse this night sit up with you, For I am sure you have your hands full all In this so sudden business.  LADY CAPULET. Good night. Get thee to bed and rest, for thou hast need.   [_Exeunt Lady Capulet and Nurse._]  JULIET. Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again. I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins That almost freezes up the heat of life. I’ll call them back again to comfort me. Nurse!—What should she do here? My dismal scene I needs must act alone. Come, vial. What if this mixture do not work at all? Shall I be married then tomorrow morning? No, No! This shall forbid it. Lie thou there.   [_Laying down her dagger._]  What if it be a poison, which the Friar Subtly hath minister’d to have me dead, Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour’d, Because he married me before to Romeo? I fear it is. And yet methinks it should not, For he hath still been tried a holy man. How if, when I am laid into the tomb, I wake before the time that Romeo Come to redeem me? There’s a fearful point! Shall I not then be stifled in the vault, To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in, And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes? Or, if I live, is it not very like, The horrible conceit of death and night, Together with the terror of the place, As in a vault, an ancient receptacle, Where for this many hundred years the bones Of all my buried ancestors are pack’d, Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth, Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say, At some hours in the night spirits resort— Alack, alack, is it not like that I, So early waking, what with loathsome smells, And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth, That living mortals, hearing them, run mad. O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught, Environed with all these hideous fears, And madly play with my forefathers’ joints? And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud? And, in this rage, with some great kinsman’s bone, As with a club, dash out my desperate brains? O look, methinks I see my cousin’s ghost Seeking out Romeo that did spit his body Upon a rapier’s point. Stay, Tybalt, stay! Romeo, Romeo, Romeo, here’s drink! I drink to thee.   [_Throws herself on the bed._]  SCENE IV. Hall in Capulet’s House.   Enter Lady Capulet and Nurse.  LADY CAPULET. Hold, take these keys and fetch more spices, Nurse.  NURSE. They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.   Enter Capulet.  CAPULET. Come, stir, stir, stir! The second cock hath crow’d, The curfew bell hath rung, ’tis three o’clock. Look to the bak’d meats, good Angelica; Spare not for cost.  NURSE. Go, you cot-quean, go, Get you to bed; faith, you’ll be sick tomorrow For this night’s watching.  CAPULET. No, not a whit. What! I have watch’d ere now All night for lesser cause, and ne’er been sick.  LADY CAPULET. Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time; But I will watch you from such watching now.   [_Exeunt Lady Capulet and Nurse._]  CAPULET. A jealous-hood, a jealous-hood!   Enter Servants, with spits, logs and baskets.  Now, fellow, what’s there?  FIRST SERVANT. Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.  CAPULET. Make haste, make haste.   [_Exit First Servant._]  —Sirrah, fetch drier logs. Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.  SECOND SERVANT. I have a head, sir, that will find out logs And never trouble Peter for the matter.   [_Exit._]  CAPULET. Mass and well said; a merry whoreson, ha. Thou shalt be loggerhead.—Good faith, ’tis day. The County will be here with music straight, For so he said he would. I hear him near.   [_Play music._]  Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, Nurse, I say!   Re-enter Nurse.  Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up. I’ll go and chat with Paris. Hie, make haste, Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already. Make haste I say.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE V. Juliet’s Chamber; Juliet on the bed.   Enter Nurse.  NURSE. Mistress! What, mistress! Juliet! Fast, I warrant her, she. Why, lamb, why, lady, fie, you slug-abed! Why, love, I say! Madam! Sweetheart! Why, bride! What, not a word? You take your pennyworths now. Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant, The County Paris hath set up his rest That you shall rest but little. God forgive me! Marry and amen. How sound is she asleep! I needs must wake her. Madam, madam, madam! Ay, let the County take you in your bed, He’ll fright you up, i’faith. Will it not be? What, dress’d, and in your clothes, and down again? I must needs wake you. Lady! Lady! Lady! Alas, alas! Help, help! My lady’s dead! O, well-a-day that ever I was born. Some aqua vitae, ho! My lord! My lady!   Enter Lady Capulet.  LADY CAPULET. What noise is here?  NURSE. O lamentable day!  LADY CAPULET. What is the matter?  NURSE. Look, look! O heavy day!  LADY CAPULET. O me, O me! My child, my only life. Revive, look up, or I will die with thee. Help, help! Call help.   Enter Capulet.  CAPULET. For shame, bring Juliet forth, her lord is come.  NURSE. She’s dead, deceas’d, she’s dead; alack the day!  LADY CAPULET. Alack the day, she’s dead, she’s dead, she’s dead!  CAPULET. Ha! Let me see her. Out alas! She’s cold, Her blood is settled and her joints are stiff. Life and these lips have long been separated. Death lies on her like an untimely frost Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.  NURSE. O lamentable day!  LADY CAPULET. O woful time!  CAPULET. Death, that hath ta’en her hence to make me wail, Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.   Enter Friar Lawrence and Paris with Musicians.  FRIAR LAWRENCE. Come, is the bride ready to go to church?  CAPULET. Ready to go, but never to return. O son, the night before thy wedding day Hath death lain with thy bride. There she lies, Flower as she was, deflowered by him. Death is my son-in-law, death is my heir; My daughter he hath wedded. I will die And leave him all; life, living, all is death’s.  PARIS. Have I thought long to see this morning’s face, And doth it give me such a sight as this?  LADY CAPULET. Accurs’d, unhappy, wretched, hateful day. Most miserable hour that e’er time saw In lasting labour of his pilgrimage. But one, poor one, one poor and loving child, But one thing to rejoice and solace in, And cruel death hath catch’d it from my sight.  NURSE. O woe! O woeful, woeful, woeful day. Most lamentable day, most woeful day That ever, ever, I did yet behold! O day, O day, O day, O hateful day. Never was seen so black a day as this. O woeful day, O woeful day.  PARIS. Beguil’d, divorced, wronged, spited, slain. Most detestable death, by thee beguil’d, By cruel, cruel thee quite overthrown. O love! O life! Not life, but love in death!  CAPULET. Despis’d, distressed, hated, martyr’d, kill’d. Uncomfortable time, why cam’st thou now To murder, murder our solemnity? O child! O child! My soul, and not my child, Dead art thou. Alack, my child is dead, And with my child my joys are buried.  FRIAR LAWRENCE. Peace, ho, for shame. Confusion’s cure lives not In these confusions. Heaven and yourself Had part in this fair maid, now heaven hath all, And all the better is it for the maid. Your part in her you could not keep from death, But heaven keeps his part in eternal life. The most you sought was her promotion, For ’twas your heaven she should be advanc’d, And weep ye now, seeing she is advanc’d Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself? O, in this love, you love your child so ill That you run mad, seeing that she is well. She’s not well married that lives married long, But she’s best married that dies married young. Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary On this fair corse, and, as the custom is, And in her best array bear her to church; For though fond nature bids us all lament, Yet nature’s tears are reason’s merriment.  CAPULET. All things that we ordained festival Turn from their office to black funeral: Our instruments to melancholy bells, Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast; Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change; Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse, And all things change them to the contrary.  FRIAR LAWRENCE. Sir, go you in, and, madam, go with him, And go, Sir Paris, everyone prepare To follow this fair corse unto her grave. The heavens do lower upon you for some ill; Move them no more by crossing their high will.   [_Exeunt Capulet, Lady Capulet, Paris and Friar._]  FIRST MUSICIAN. Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.  NURSE. Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up, For well you know this is a pitiful case.  FIRST MUSICIAN. Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.   [_Exit Nurse._]   Enter Peter.  PETER. Musicians, O, musicians, ‘Heart’s ease,’ ‘Heart’s ease’, O, and you will have me live, play ‘Heart’s ease.’  FIRST MUSICIAN. Why ‘Heart’s ease’?  PETER. O musicians, because my heart itself plays ‘My heart is full’. O play me some merry dump to comfort me.  FIRST MUSICIAN. Not a dump we, ’tis no time to play now.  PETER. You will not then?  FIRST MUSICIAN. No.  PETER. I will then give it you soundly.  FIRST MUSICIAN. What will you give us?  PETER. No money, on my faith, but the gleek! I will give you the minstrel.  FIRST MUSICIAN. Then will I give you the serving-creature.  PETER. Then will I lay the serving-creature’s dagger on your pate. I will carry no crotchets. I’ll re you, I’ll fa you. Do you note me?  FIRST MUSICIAN. And you re us and fa us, you note us.  SECOND MUSICIAN. Pray you put up your dagger, and put out your wit.  PETER. Then have at you with my wit. I will dry-beat you with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer me like men.     ‘When griping griefs the heart doth wound,       And doleful dumps the mind oppress,     Then music with her silver sound’— Why ‘silver sound’? Why ‘music with her silver sound’? What say you, Simon Catling?  FIRST MUSICIAN. Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.  PETER. Prates. What say you, Hugh Rebeck?  SECOND MUSICIAN. I say ‘silver sound’ because musicians sound for silver.  PETER. Prates too! What say you, James Soundpost?  THIRD MUSICIAN. Faith, I know not what to say.  PETER. O, I cry you mercy, you are the singer. I will say for you. It is ‘music with her silver sound’ because musicians have no gold for sounding.       ‘Then music with her silver sound       With speedy help doth lend redress.’   [_Exit._]  FIRST MUSICIAN. What a pestilent knave is this same!  SECOND MUSICIAN. Hang him, Jack. Come, we’ll in here, tarry for the mourners, and stay dinner.   [_Exeunt._]
  ACT V  SCENE I. Mantua. A Street.
 Enter Romeo.  ROMEO. If I may trust the flattering eye of sleep, My dreams presage some joyful news at hand. My bosom’s lord sits lightly in his throne; And all this day an unaccustom’d spirit Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. I dreamt my lady came and found me dead,— Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave to think!— And breath’d such life with kisses in my lips, That I reviv’d, and was an emperor. Ah me, how sweet is love itself possess’d, When but love’s shadows are so rich in joy.   Enter Balthasar.  News from Verona! How now, Balthasar? Dost thou not bring me letters from the Friar? How doth my lady? Is my father well? How fares my Juliet? That I ask again; For nothing can be ill if she be well.  BALTHASAR. Then she is well, and nothing can be ill. Her body sleeps in Capel’s monument, And her immortal part with angels lives. I saw her laid low in her kindred’s vault, And presently took post to tell it you. O pardon me for bringing these ill news, Since you did leave it for my office, sir.  ROMEO. Is it even so? Then I defy you, stars! Thou know’st my lodging. Get me ink and paper, And hire post-horses. I will hence tonight.  BALTHASAR. I do beseech you sir, have patience. Your looks are pale and wild, and do import Some misadventure.  ROMEO. Tush, thou art deceiv’d. Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do. Hast thou no letters to me from the Friar?  BALTHASAR. No, my good lord.  ROMEO. No matter. Get thee gone, And hire those horses. I’ll be with thee straight.   [_Exit Balthasar._]  Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight. Let’s see for means. O mischief thou art swift To enter in the thoughts of desperate men. I do remember an apothecary,— And hereabouts he dwells,—which late I noted In tatter’d weeds, with overwhelming brows, Culling of simples, meagre were his looks, Sharp misery had worn him to the bones; And in his needy shop a tortoise hung, An alligator stuff’d, and other skins Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves A beggarly account of empty boxes, Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds, Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses Were thinly scatter’d, to make up a show. Noting this penury, to myself I said, And if a man did need a poison now, Whose sale is present death in Mantua, Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him. O, this same thought did but forerun my need, And this same needy man must sell it me. As I remember, this should be the house. Being holiday, the beggar’s shop is shut. What, ho! Apothecary!   Enter Apothecary.  APOTHECARY. Who calls so loud?  ROMEO. Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor. Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me have A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear As will disperse itself through all the veins, That the life-weary taker may fall dead, And that the trunk may be discharg’d of breath As violently as hasty powder fir’d Doth hurry from the fatal cannon’s womb.  APOTHECARY. Such mortal drugs I have, but Mantua’s law Is death to any he that utters them.  ROMEO. Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness, And fear’st to die? Famine is in thy cheeks, Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes, Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back. The world is not thy friend, nor the world’s law; The world affords no law to make thee rich; Then be not poor, but break it and take this.  APOTHECARY. My poverty, but not my will consents.  ROMEO. I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.  APOTHECARY. Put this in any liquid thing you will And drink it off; and, if you had the strength Of twenty men, it would despatch you straight.  ROMEO. There is thy gold, worse poison to men’s souls, Doing more murder in this loathsome world Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell. I sell thee poison, thou hast sold me none. Farewell, buy food, and get thyself in flesh. Come, cordial and not poison, go with me To Juliet’s grave, for there must I use thee.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. Friar Lawrence’s Cell.   Enter Friar John.  FRIAR JOHN. Holy Franciscan Friar! Brother, ho!   Enter Friar Lawrence.  FRIAR LAWRENCE. This same should be the voice of Friar John. Welcome from Mantua. What says Romeo? Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.  FRIAR JOHN. Going to find a barefoot brother out, One of our order, to associate me, Here in this city visiting the sick, And finding him, the searchers of the town, Suspecting that we both were in a house Where the infectious pestilence did reign, Seal’d up the doors, and would not let us forth, So that my speed to Mantua there was stay’d.  FRIAR LAWRENCE. Who bare my letter then to Romeo?  FRIAR JOHN. I could not send it,—here it is again,— Nor get a messenger to bring it thee, So fearful were they of infection.  FRIAR LAWRENCE. Unhappy fortune! By my brotherhood, The letter was not nice, but full of charge, Of dear import, and the neglecting it May do much danger. Friar John, go hence, Get me an iron crow and bring it straight Unto my cell.  FRIAR JOHN. Brother, I’ll go and bring it thee.   [_Exit._]  FRIAR LAWRENCE. Now must I to the monument alone. Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake. She will beshrew me much that Romeo Hath had no notice of these accidents; But I will write again to Mantua, And keep her at my cell till Romeo come. Poor living corse, clos’d in a dead man’s tomb.   [_Exit._]  SCENE III. A churchyard; in it a Monument belonging to the Capulets.   Enter Paris, and his Page bearing flowers and a torch.  PARIS. Give me thy torch, boy. Hence and stand aloof. Yet put it out, for I would not be seen. Under yond yew tree lay thee all along, Holding thy ear close to the hollow ground; So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread, Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves, But thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me, As signal that thou hear’st something approach. Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.  PAGE. [_Aside._] I am almost afraid to stand alone Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.   [_Retires._]  PARIS. Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew. O woe, thy canopy is dust and stones, Which with sweet water nightly I will dew, Or wanting that, with tears distill’d by moans. The obsequies that I for thee will keep, Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.   [_The Page whistles._]  The boy gives warning something doth approach. What cursed foot wanders this way tonight, To cross my obsequies and true love’s rite? What, with a torch! Muffle me, night, awhile.   [_Retires._]   Enter Romeo and Balthasar with a torch, mattock, &c.  ROMEO. Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron. Hold, take this letter; early in the morning See thou deliver it to my lord and father. Give me the light; upon thy life I charge thee, Whate’er thou hear’st or seest, stand all aloof And do not interrupt me in my course. Why I descend into this bed of death Is partly to behold my lady’s face, But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger A precious ring, a ring that I must use In dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone. But if thou jealous dost return to pry In what I further shall intend to do, By heaven I will tear thee joint by joint, And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs. The time and my intents are savage-wild; More fierce and more inexorable far Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.  BALTHASAR. I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.  ROMEO. So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that. Live, and be prosperous, and farewell, good fellow.  BALTHASAR. For all this same, I’ll hide me hereabout. His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.   [_Retires_]  ROMEO. Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death, Gorg’d with the dearest morsel of the earth, Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,   [_Breaking open the door of the monument._]  And in despite, I’ll cram thee with more food.  PARIS. This is that banish’d haughty Montague That murder’d my love’s cousin,—with which grief, It is supposed, the fair creature died,— And here is come to do some villainous shame To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.   [_Advances._]  Stop thy unhallow’d toil, vile Montague. Can vengeance be pursu’d further than death? Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee. Obey, and go with me, for thou must die.  ROMEO. I must indeed; and therefore came I hither. Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man. Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone; Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth, Put not another sin upon my head By urging me to fury. O be gone. By heaven I love thee better than myself; For I come hither arm’d against myself. Stay not, be gone, live, and hereafter say, A madman’s mercy bid thee run away.  PARIS. I do defy thy conjuration, And apprehend thee for a felon here.  ROMEO. Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!   [_They fight._]  PAGE. O lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.   [_Exit._]  PARIS. O, I am slain! [_Falls._] If thou be merciful, Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.   [_Dies._]  ROMEO. In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face. Mercutio’s kinsman, noble County Paris! What said my man, when my betossed soul Did not attend him as we rode? I think He told me Paris should have married Juliet. Said he not so? Or did I dream it so? Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet, To think it was so? O, give me thy hand, One writ with me in sour misfortune’s book. I’ll bury thee in a triumphant grave. A grave? O no, a lantern, slaught’red youth, For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes This vault a feasting presence full of light. Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr’d.   [_Laying Paris in the monument._]  How oft when men are at the point of death Have they been merry! Which their keepers call A lightning before death. O, how may I Call this a lightning? O my love, my wife, Death that hath suck’d the honey of thy breath, Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty. Thou art not conquer’d. Beauty’s ensign yet Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks, And death’s pale flag is not advanced there. Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet? O, what more favour can I do to thee Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain To sunder his that was thine enemy? Forgive me, cousin. Ah, dear Juliet, Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe That unsubstantial death is amorous; And that the lean abhorred monster keeps Thee here in dark to be his paramour? For fear of that I still will stay with thee, And never from this palace of dim night Depart again. Here, here will I remain With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here Will I set up my everlasting rest; And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last. Arms, take your last embrace! And, lips, O you The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss A dateless bargain to engrossing death. Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide. Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark. Here’s to my love! [_Drinks._] O true apothecary! Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.   [_Dies._]   Enter, at the other end of the Churchyard, Friar Lawrence, with a  lantern, crow, and spade.  FRIAR LAWRENCE. Saint Francis be my speed. How oft tonight Have my old feet stumbled at graves? Who’s there? Who is it that consorts, so late, the dead?  BALTHASAR. Here’s one, a friend, and one that knows you well.  FRIAR LAWRENCE. Bliss be upon you. Tell me, good my friend, What torch is yond that vainly lends his light To grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern, It burneth in the Capels’ monument.  BALTHASAR. It doth so, holy sir, and there’s my master, One that you love.  FRIAR LAWRENCE. Who is it?  BALTHASAR. Romeo.  FRIAR LAWRENCE. How long hath he been there?  BALTHASAR. Full half an hour.  FRIAR LAWRENCE. Go with me to the vault.  BALTHASAR. I dare not, sir; My master knows not but I am gone hence, And fearfully did menace me with death If I did stay to look on his intents.  FRIAR LAWRENCE. Stay then, I’ll go alone. Fear comes upon me. O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.  BALTHASAR. As I did sleep under this yew tree here, I dreamt my master and another fought, And that my master slew him.  FRIAR LAWRENCE. Romeo! [_Advances._] Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains The stony entrance of this sepulchre? What mean these masterless and gory swords To lie discolour’d by this place of peace?   [_Enters the monument._]  Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too? And steep’d in blood? Ah what an unkind hour Is guilty of this lamentable chance? The lady stirs.   [_Juliet wakes and stirs._]  JULIET. O comfortable Friar, where is my lord? I do remember well where I should be, And there I am. Where is my Romeo?   [_Noise within._]  FRIAR LAWRENCE. I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep. A greater power than we can contradict Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away. Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead; And Paris too. Come, I’ll dispose of thee Among a sisterhood of holy nuns. Stay not to question, for the watch is coming. Come, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay.  JULIET. Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.   [_Exit Friar Lawrence._]  What’s here? A cup clos’d in my true love’s hand? Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end. O churl. Drink all, and left no friendly drop To help me after? I will kiss thy lips. Haply some poison yet doth hang on them, To make me die with a restorative.   [_Kisses him._]  Thy lips are warm!  FIRST WATCH. [_Within._] Lead, boy. Which way?  JULIET. Yea, noise? Then I’ll be brief. O happy dagger.   [_Snatching Romeo’s dagger._]  This is thy sheath. [_stabs herself_] There rest, and let me die.   [_Falls on Romeo’s body and dies._]   Enter Watch with the Page of Paris.  PAGE. This is the place. There, where the torch doth burn.  FIRST WATCH. The ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard. Go, some of you, whoe’er you find attach.   [_Exeunt some of the Watch._]  Pitiful sight! Here lies the County slain, And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead, Who here hath lain this two days buried. Go tell the Prince; run to the Capulets. Raise up the Montagues, some others search.   [_Exeunt others of the Watch._]  We see the ground whereon these woes do lie, But the true ground of all these piteous woes We cannot without circumstance descry.   Re-enter some of the Watch with Balthasar.  SECOND WATCH. Here’s Romeo’s man. We found him in the churchyard.  FIRST WATCH. Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither.   Re-enter others of the Watch with Friar Lawrence.  THIRD WATCH. Here is a Friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps. We took this mattock and this spade from him As he was coming from this churchyard side.  FIRST WATCH. A great suspicion. Stay the Friar too.   Enter the Prince and Attendants.  PRINCE. What misadventure is so early up, That calls our person from our morning’s rest?   Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet and others.  CAPULET. What should it be that they so shriek abroad?  LADY CAPULET. O the people in the street cry Romeo, Some Juliet, and some Paris, and all run With open outcry toward our monument.  PRINCE. What fear is this which startles in our ears?  FIRST WATCH. Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain, And Romeo dead, and Juliet, dead before, Warm and new kill’d.  PRINCE. Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.  FIRST WATCH. Here is a Friar, and slaughter’d Romeo’s man, With instruments upon them fit to open These dead men’s tombs.  CAPULET. O heaven! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds! This dagger hath mista’en, for lo, his house Is empty on the back of Montague, And it mis-sheathed in my daughter’s bosom.  LADY CAPULET. O me! This sight of death is as a bell That warns my old age to a sepulchre.   Enter Montague and others.  PRINCE. Come, Montague, for thou art early up, To see thy son and heir more early down.  MONTAGUE. Alas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight. Grief of my son’s exile hath stopp’d her breath. What further woe conspires against mine age?  PRINCE. Look, and thou shalt see.  MONTAGUE. O thou untaught! What manners is in this, To press before thy father to a grave?  PRINCE. Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while, Till we can clear these ambiguities, And know their spring, their head, their true descent, And then will I be general of your woes, And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear, And let mischance be slave to patience. Bring forth the parties of suspicion.  FRIAR LAWRENCE. I am the greatest, able to do least, Yet most suspected, as the time and place Doth make against me, of this direful murder. And here I stand, both to impeach and purge Myself condemned and myself excus’d.  PRINCE. Then say at once what thou dost know in this.  FRIAR LAWRENCE. I will be brief, for my short date of breath Is not so long as is a tedious tale. Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet, And she, there dead, that Romeo’s faithful wife. I married them; and their stol’n marriage day Was Tybalt’s doomsday, whose untimely death Banish’d the new-made bridegroom from this city; For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin’d. You, to remove that siege of grief from her, Betroth’d, and would have married her perforce To County Paris. Then comes she to me, And with wild looks, bid me devise some means To rid her from this second marriage, Or in my cell there would she kill herself. Then gave I her, so tutored by my art, A sleeping potion, which so took effect As I intended, for it wrought on her The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo That he should hither come as this dire night To help to take her from her borrow’d grave, Being the time the potion’s force should cease. But he which bore my letter, Friar John, Was stay’d by accident; and yesternight Return’d my letter back. Then all alone At the prefixed hour of her waking Came I to take her from her kindred’s vault, Meaning to keep her closely at my cell Till I conveniently could send to Romeo. But when I came, some minute ere the time Of her awaking, here untimely lay The noble Paris and true Romeo dead. She wakes; and I entreated her come forth And bear this work of heaven with patience. But then a noise did scare me from the tomb; And she, too desperate, would not go with me, But, as it seems, did violence on herself. All this I know; and to the marriage Her Nurse is privy. And if ought in this Miscarried by my fault, let my old life Be sacrific’d, some hour before his time, Unto the rigour of severest law.  PRINCE. We still have known thee for a holy man. Where’s Romeo’s man? What can he say to this?  BALTHASAR. I brought my master news of Juliet’s death, And then in post he came from Mantua To this same place, to this same monument. This letter he early bid me give his father, And threaten’d me with death, going in the vault, If I departed not, and left him there.  PRINCE. Give me the letter, I will look on it. Where is the County’s Page that rais’d the watch? Sirrah, what made your master in this place?  PAGE. He came with flowers to strew his lady’s grave, And bid me stand aloof, and so I did. Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb, And by and by my master drew on him, And then I ran away to call the watch.  PRINCE. This letter doth make good the Friar’s words, Their course of love, the tidings of her death. And here he writes that he did buy a poison Of a poor ’pothecary, and therewithal Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet. Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montague, See what a scourge is laid upon your hate, That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love! And I, for winking at your discords too, Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish’d.  CAPULET. O brother Montague, give me thy hand. This is my daughter’s jointure, for no more Can I demand.  MONTAGUE. But I can give thee more, For I will raise her statue in pure gold, That whiles Verona by that name is known, There shall no figure at such rate be set As that of true and faithful Juliet.  CAPULET. As rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie, Poor sacrifices of our enmity.  PRINCE. A glooming peace this morning with it brings; The sun for sorrow will not show his head. Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things. Some shall be pardon’d, and some punished, For never was a story of more woe Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.   [_Exeunt._]

  INDUCTION  SCENE I. Before an alehouse on a heath.  Enter Hostess and Sly  SLY. I’ll pheeze you, in faith.  HOSTESS. A pair of stocks, you rogue!  SLY. Y’are a baggage; the Slys are no rogues; look in the chronicles: we came in with Richard Conqueror. Therefore, _paucas pallabris_; let the world slide. Sessa!  HOSTESS. You will not pay for the glasses you have burst?  SLY. No, not a denier. Go by, Saint Jeronimy, go to thy cold bed and warm thee.  HOSTESS. I know my remedy; I must go fetch the third-borough.  [_Exit_]  SLY. Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I’ll answer him by law. I’ll not budge an inch, boy: let him come, and kindly.  [_Lies down on the ground, and falls asleep._]
Horns winded. Enter a Lord from hunting, with Huntsmen and Servants.  LORD. Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds; Brach Merriman, the poor cur is emboss’d, And couple Clowder with the deep-mouth’d brach. Saw’st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good At the hedge-corner, in the coldest fault? I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.  FIRST HUNTSMAN. Why, Bellman is as good as he, my lord; He cried upon it at the merest loss, And twice today pick’d out the dullest scent; Trust me, I take him for the better dog.  LORD. Thou art a fool: if Echo were as fleet, I would esteem him worth a dozen such. But sup them well, and look unto them all; Tomorrow I intend to hunt again.  FIRST HUNTSMAN. I will, my lord.  LORD. [_Sees Sly_.] What’s here? One dead, or drunk? See, doth he breathe?  SECOND HUNTSMAN. He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm’d with ale, This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.  LORD. O monstrous beast! how like a swine he lies! Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image! Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man. What think you, if he were convey’d to bed, Wrapp’d in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers, A most delicious banquet by his bed, And brave attendants near him when he wakes, Would not the beggar then forget himself?  FIRST HUNTSMAN. Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.  SECOND HUNTSMAN. It would seem strange unto him when he wak’d.  LORD. Even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy. Then take him up, and manage well the jest. Carry him gently to my fairest chamber, And hang it round with all my wanton pictures; Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters, And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet. Procure me music ready when he wakes, To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound; And if he chance to speak, be ready straight, And with a low submissive reverence Say ‘What is it your honour will command?’ Let one attend him with a silver basin Full of rose-water and bestrew’d with flowers; Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper, And say ‘Will’t please your lordship cool your hands?’ Someone be ready with a costly suit, And ask him what apparel he will wear; Another tell him of his hounds and horse, And that his lady mourns at his disease. Persuade him that he hath been lunatic; And, when he says he is—say that he dreams, For he is nothing but a mighty lord. This do, and do it kindly, gentle sirs; It will be pastime passing excellent, If it be husbanded with modesty.  FIRST HUNTSMAN. My lord, I warrant you we will play our part, As he shall think by our true diligence, He is no less than what we say he is.  LORD. Take him up gently, and to bed with him, And each one to his office when he wakes.  [Sly _is borne out. A trumpet sounds._]  Sirrah, go see what trumpet ’tis that sounds.  [_Exit_ Servant.]  Belike some noble gentleman that means, Travelling some journey, to repose him here.
Re-enter Servant.  How now! who is it?  SERVANT. An it please your honour, players That offer service to your lordship.  LORD. Bid them come near.
Enter Players.  Now, fellows, you are welcome.  PLAYERS. We thank your honour.  LORD. Do you intend to stay with me tonight?  PLAYER. So please your lordship to accept our duty.  LORD. With all my heart. This fellow I remember Since once he play’d a farmer’s eldest son; ’Twas where you woo’d the gentlewoman so well. I have forgot your name; but, sure, that part Was aptly fitted and naturally perform’d.  PLAYER. I think ’twas Soto that your honour means.  LORD. ’Tis very true; thou didst it excellent. Well, you are come to me in happy time, The rather for I have some sport in hand Wherein your cunning can assist me much. There is a lord will hear you play tonight; But I am doubtful of your modesties, Lest, over-eying of his odd behaviour,— For yet his honour never heard a play,— You break into some merry passion And so offend him; for I tell you, sirs, If you should smile, he grows impatient.  PLAYER. Fear not, my lord; we can contain ourselves, Were he the veriest antick in the world.  LORD. Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery, And give them friendly welcome everyone: Let them want nothing that my house affords.  [_Exit one with the Players._]  Sirrah, go you to Barthol’mew my page, And see him dress’d in all suits like a lady; That done, conduct him to the drunkard’s chamber, And call him ‘madam,’ do him obeisance. Tell him from me—as he will win my love,— He bear himself with honourable action, Such as he hath observ’d in noble ladies Unto their lords, by them accomplished; Such duty to the drunkard let him do, With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy, And say ‘What is’t your honour will command, Wherein your lady and your humble wife May show her duty and make known her love?’ And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses, And with declining head into his bosom, Bid him shed tears, as being overjoy’d To see her noble lord restor’d to health, Who for this seven years hath esteemed him No better than a poor and loathsome beggar. And if the boy have not a woman’s gift To rain a shower of commanded tears, An onion will do well for such a shift, Which, in a napkin being close convey’d, Shall in despite enforce a watery eye. See this dispatch’d with all the haste thou canst; Anon I’ll give thee more instructions.  [_Exit Servant._]  I know the boy will well usurp the grace, Voice, gait, and action of a gentlewoman; I long to hear him call the drunkard husband; And how my men will stay themselves from laughter When they do homage to this simple peasant. I’ll in to counsel them; haply my presence May well abate the over-merry spleen, Which otherwise would grow into extremes.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. A bedchamber in the Lord’s house.  Sly is discovered in a rich nightgown, with Attendants: some with apparel, basin, ewer, and other appurtenances; and Lord, dressed like a servant.  SLY. For God’s sake! a pot of small ale.  FIRST SERVANT. Will’t please your lordship drink a cup of sack?  SECOND SERVANT. Will’t please your honour taste of these conserves?  THIRD SERVANT. What raiment will your honour wear today?  SLY. I am Christophero Sly; call not me honour nor lordship. I ne’er drank sack in my life; and if you give me any conserves, give me conserves of beef. Ne’er ask me what raiment I’ll wear, for I have no more doublets than backs, no more stockings than legs, nor no more shoes than feet: nay, sometime more feet than shoes, or such shoes as my toes look through the over-leather.  LORD. Heaven cease this idle humour in your honour! O, that a mighty man of such descent, Of such possessions, and so high esteem, Should be infused with so foul a spirit!  SLY. What! would you make me mad? Am not I Christopher Sly, old Sly’s son of Burton-heath; by birth a pedlar, by education a cardmaker, by transmutation a bear-herd, and now by present profession a tinker? Ask Marian Hacket, the fat ale-wife of Wincot, if she know me not: if she say I am not fourteen pence on the score for sheer ale, score me up for the lyingest knave in Christendom. What! I am not bestraught. Here’s—  THIRD SERVANT. O! this it is that makes your lady mourn.  SECOND SERVANT. O! this is it that makes your servants droop.  LORD. Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house, As beaten hence by your strange lunacy. O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth, Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment, And banish hence these abject lowly dreams. Look how thy servants do attend on thee, Each in his office ready at thy beck: Wilt thou have music? Hark! Apollo plays,  [_Music._]  And twenty caged nightingales do sing: Or wilt thou sleep? We’ll have thee to a couch Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed On purpose trimm’d up for Semiramis. Say thou wilt walk: we will bestrew the ground: Or wilt thou ride? Thy horses shall be trapp’d, Their harness studded all with gold and pearl. Dost thou love hawking? Thou hast hawks will soar Above the morning lark: or wilt thou hunt? Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them And fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth.  FIRST SERVANT. Say thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as swift As breathed stags; ay, fleeter than the roe.  SECOND SERVANT. Dost thou love pictures? We will fetch thee straight Adonis painted by a running brook, And Cytherea all in sedges hid, Which seem to move and wanton with her breath Even as the waving sedges play with wind.  LORD. We’ll show thee Io as she was a maid And how she was beguiled and surpris’d, As lively painted as the deed was done.  THIRD SERVANT. Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood, Scratching her legs, that one shall swear she bleeds And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep, So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.  LORD. Thou art a lord, and nothing but a lord: Thou hast a lady far more beautiful Than any woman in this waning age.  FIRST SERVANT. And, till the tears that she hath shed for thee Like envious floods o’er-run her lovely face, She was the fairest creature in the world; And yet she is inferior to none.  SLY. Am I a lord? and have I such a lady? Or do I dream? Or have I dream’d till now? I do not sleep: I see, I hear, I speak; I smell sweet savours, and I feel soft things: Upon my life, I am a lord indeed; And not a tinker, nor Christophero Sly. Well, bring our lady hither to our sight; And once again, a pot o’ the smallest ale.  SECOND SERVANT. Will’t please your mightiness to wash your hands?  [_Servants present a ewer, basin and napkin._]  O, how we joy to see your wit restor’d! O, that once more you knew but what you are! These fifteen years you have been in a dream, Or, when you wak’d, so wak’d as if you slept.  SLY. These fifteen years! by my fay, a goodly nap. But did I never speak of all that time?  FIRST SERVANT. O! yes, my lord, but very idle words; For though you lay here in this goodly chamber, Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door, And rail upon the hostess of the house, And say you would present her at the leet, Because she brought stone jugs and no seal’d quarts. Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.  SLY. Ay, the woman’s maid of the house.  THIRD SERVANT. Why, sir, you know no house nor no such maid, Nor no such men as you have reckon’d up, As Stephen Sly, and old John Naps of Greece, And Peter Turph, and Henry Pimpernell; And twenty more such names and men as these, Which never were, nor no man ever saw.  SLY. Now, Lord be thanked for my good amends!  ALL. Amen.
Enter the Page, as a lady, with Attendants.  SLY. I thank thee; thou shalt not lose by it.  PAGE. How fares my noble lord?  SLY. Marry, I fare well; for here is cheer enough. Where is my wife?  PAGE. Here, noble lord: what is thy will with her?  SLY. Are you my wife, and will not call me husband? My men should call me lord: I am your goodman.  PAGE. My husband and my lord, my lord and husband; I am your wife in all obedience.  SLY. I know it well. What must I call her?  LORD. Madam.  SLY. Alice madam, or Joan madam?  LORD. Madam, and nothing else; so lords call ladies.  SLY. Madam wife, they say that I have dream’d And slept above some fifteen year or more.  PAGE. Ay, and the time seems thirty unto me, Being all this time abandon’d from your bed.  SLY. ’Tis much. Servants, leave me and her alone. Madam, undress you, and come now to bed.  PAGE. Thrice noble lord, let me entreat of you To pardon me yet for a night or two; Or, if not so, until the sun be set: For your physicians have expressly charg’d, In peril to incur your former malady, That I should yet absent me from your bed: I hope this reason stands for my excuse.  SLY. Ay, it stands so that I may hardly tarry so long; but I would be loath to fall into my dreams again: I will therefore tarry in despite of the flesh and the blood.
Enter a Messenger.  MESSENGER. Your honour’s players, hearing your amendment, Are come to play a pleasant comedy; For so your doctors hold it very meet, Seeing too much sadness hath congeal’d your blood, And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy: Therefore they thought it good you hear a play, And frame your mind to mirth and merriment, Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life.  SLY. Marry, I will; let them play it. Is not a commonty a Christmas gambold or a tumbling-trick?  PAGE. No, my good lord; it is more pleasing stuff.  SLY. What! household stuff?  PAGE. It is a kind of history.  SLY. Well, we’ll see’t. Come, madam wife, sit by my side and let the world slip: we shall ne’er be younger.
  ACT I  SCENE I. Padua. A public place.
Flourish. Enter Lucentio and Tranio.  LUCENTIO. Tranio, since for the great desire I had To see fair Padua, nursery of arts, I am arriv’d for fruitful Lombardy, The pleasant garden of great Italy, And by my father’s love and leave am arm’d With his good will and thy good company, My trusty servant well approv’d in all, Here let us breathe, and haply institute A course of learning and ingenious studies. Pisa, renowned for grave citizens, Gave me my being and my father first, A merchant of great traffic through the world, Vincentio, come of the Bentivolii. Vincentio’s son, brought up in Florence, It shall become to serve all hopes conceiv’d, To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds: And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study, Virtue and that part of philosophy Will I apply that treats of happiness By virtue specially to be achiev’d. Tell me thy mind; for I have Pisa left And am to Padua come as he that leaves A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep, And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.  TRANIO. _Mi perdonato_, gentle master mine; I am in all affected as yourself; Glad that you thus continue your resolve To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy. Only, good master, while we do admire This virtue and this moral discipline, Let’s be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray; Or so devote to Aristotle’s checks As Ovid be an outcast quite abjur’d. Balk logic with acquaintance that you have, And practise rhetoric in your common talk; Music and poesy use to quicken you; The mathematics and the metaphysics, Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you: No profit grows where is no pleasure ta’en; In brief, sir, study what you most affect.  LUCENTIO. Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise. If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore, We could at once put us in readiness, And take a lodging fit to entertain Such friends as time in Padua shall beget. But stay awhile; what company is this?  TRANIO. Master, some show to welcome us to town.  [_Lucentio and Tranio stand aside._]
Enter Baptista, Katherina, Bianca, Gremio and Hortensio.  BAPTISTA. Gentlemen, importune me no farther, For how I firmly am resolv’d you know; That is, not to bestow my youngest daughter Before I have a husband for the elder. If either of you both love Katherina, Because I know you well and love you well, Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.  GREMIO. To cart her rather: she’s too rough for me. There, there, Hortensio, will you any wife?  KATHERINA. [_To Baptista_] I pray you, sir, is it your will To make a stale of me amongst these mates?  HORTENSIO. Mates, maid! How mean you that? No mates for you, Unless you were of gentler, milder mould.  KATHERINA. I’ faith, sir, you shall never need to fear; I wis it is not half way to her heart; But if it were, doubt not her care should be To comb your noddle with a three-legg’d stool, And paint your face, and use you like a fool.  HORTENSIO. From all such devils, good Lord deliver us!  GREMIO. And me, too, good Lord!  TRANIO. Husht, master! Here’s some good pastime toward: That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward.  LUCENTIO. But in the other’s silence do I see Maid’s mild behaviour and sobriety. Peace, Tranio!  TRANIO. Well said, master; mum! and gaze your fill.  BAPTISTA. Gentlemen, that I may soon make good What I have said,—Bianca, get you in: And let it not displease thee, good Bianca, For I will love thee ne’er the less, my girl.  KATHERINA. A pretty peat! it is best put finger in the eye, and she knew why.  BIANCA. Sister, content you in my discontent. Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe: My books and instruments shall be my company, On them to look, and practise by myself.  LUCENTIO. Hark, Tranio! thou mayst hear Minerva speak.  HORTENSIO. Signior Baptista, will you be so strange? Sorry am I that our good will effects Bianca’s grief.  GREMIO. Why will you mew her up, Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell, And make her bear the penance of her tongue?  BAPTISTA. Gentlemen, content ye; I am resolv’d. Go in, Bianca.  [_Exit Bianca._]  And for I know she taketh most delight In music, instruments, and poetry, Schoolmasters will I keep within my house Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio, Or, Signior Gremio, you, know any such, Prefer them hither; for to cunning men I will be very kind, and liberal To mine own children in good bringing up; And so, farewell. Katherina, you may stay; For I have more to commune with Bianca.  [_Exit._]  KATHERINA. Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not? What! shall I be appointed hours, as though, belike, I knew not what to take and what to leave? Ha!  [_Exit._]  GREMIO. You may go to the devil’s dam: your gifts are so good here’s none will hold you. Their love is not so great, Hortensio, but we may blow our nails together, and fast it fairly out; our cake’s dough on both sides. Farewell: yet, for the love I bear my sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit man to teach her that wherein she delights, I will wish him to her father.  HORTENSIO. So will I, Signior Gremio: but a word, I pray. Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked parle, know now, upon advice, it toucheth us both,—that we may yet again have access to our fair mistress, and be happy rivals in Bianca’s love,—to labour and effect one thing specially.  GREMIO. What’s that, I pray?  HORTENSIO. Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.  GREMIO. A husband! a devil.  HORTENSIO. I say, a husband.  GREMIO. I say, a devil. Thinkest thou, Hortensio, though her father be very rich, any man is so very a fool to be married to hell?  HORTENSIO. Tush, Gremio! Though it pass your patience and mine to endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good fellows in the world, and a man could light on them, would take her with all faults, and money enough.  GREMIO. I cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry with this condition: to be whipp’d at the high cross every morning.  HORTENSIO. Faith, as you say, there’s small choice in rotten apples. But come; since this bar in law makes us friends, it shall be so far forth friendly maintained, till by helping Baptista’s eldest daughter to a husband, we set his youngest free for a husband, and then have to’t afresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy man be his dole! He that runs fastest gets the ring. How say you, Signior Gremio?  GREMIO. I am agreed; and would I had given him the best horse in Padua to begin his wooing, that would thoroughly woo her, wed her, and bed her, and rid the house of her. Come on.  [_Exeunt Gremio and Hortensio._]  TRANIO. I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible That love should of a sudden take such hold?  LUCENTIO. O Tranio! till I found it to be true, I never thought it possible or likely; But see, while idly I stood looking on, I found the effect of love in idleness; And now in plainness do confess to thee, That art to me as secret and as dear As Anna to the Queen of Carthage was, Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio, If I achieve not this young modest girl. Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst: Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.  TRANIO. Master, it is no time to chide you now; Affection is not rated from the heart: If love have touch’d you, nought remains but so: _Redime te captum quam queas minimo._  LUCENTIO. Gramercies, lad; go forward; this contents; The rest will comfort, for thy counsel’s sound.  TRANIO. Master, you look’d so longly on the maid. Perhaps you mark’d not what’s the pith of all.  LUCENTIO. O, yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face, Such as the daughter of Agenor had, That made great Jove to humble him to her hand, When with his knees he kiss’d the Cretan strand.  TRANIO. Saw you no more? mark’d you not how her sister Began to scold and raise up such a storm That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?  LUCENTIO. Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move, And with her breath she did perfume the air; Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.  TRANIO. Nay, then, ’tis time to stir him from his trance. I pray, awake, sir: if you love the maid, Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands: Her elder sister is so curst and shrewd, That till the father rid his hands of her, Master, your love must live a maid at home; And therefore has he closely mew’d her up, Because she will not be annoy’d with suitors.  LUCENTIO. Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father’s he! But art thou not advis’d he took some care To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?  TRANIO. Ay, marry, am I, sir, and now ’tis plotted.  LUCENTIO. I have it, Tranio.  TRANIO. Master, for my hand, Both our inventions meet and jump in one.  LUCENTIO. Tell me thine first.  TRANIO. You will be schoolmaster, And undertake the teaching of the maid: That’s your device.  LUCENTIO. It is: may it be done?  TRANIO. Not possible; for who shall bear your part And be in Padua here Vincentio’s son; Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends; Visit his countrymen, and banquet them?  LUCENTIO. _Basta_, content thee, for I have it full. We have not yet been seen in any house, Nor can we be distinguish’d by our faces For man or master: then it follows thus: Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead, Keep house and port and servants, as I should; I will some other be; some Florentine, Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa. ’Tis hatch’d, and shall be so: Tranio, at once Uncase thee; take my colour’d hat and cloak. When Biondello comes, he waits on thee; But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.  [_They exchange habits_]  TRANIO. So had you need. In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is, And I am tied to be obedient; For so your father charg’d me at our parting, ‘Be serviceable to my son,’ quoth he, Although I think ’twas in another sense: I am content to be Lucentio, Because so well I love Lucentio.  LUCENTIO. Tranio, be so, because Lucentio loves; And let me be a slave, to achieve that maid Whose sudden sight hath thrall’d my wounded eye.
Enter Biondello.  Here comes the rogue. Sirrah, where have you been?  BIONDELLO. Where have I been? Nay, how now! where are you? Master, has my fellow Tranio stol’n your clothes? Or you stol’n his? or both? Pray, what’s the news?  LUCENTIO. Sirrah, come hither: ’tis no time to jest, And therefore frame your manners to the time. Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life, Puts my apparel and my count’nance on, And I for my escape have put on his; For in a quarrel since I came ashore I kill’d a man, and fear I was descried. Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes, While I make way from hence to save my life. You understand me?  BIONDELLO. I, sir! Ne’er a whit.  LUCENTIO. And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth: Tranio is changed to Lucentio.  BIONDELLO. The better for him: would I were so too!  TRANIO. So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after, That Lucentio indeed had Baptista’s youngest daughter. But, sirrah, not for my sake but your master’s, I advise You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies: When I am alone, why, then I am Tranio; But in all places else your master, Lucentio.  LUCENTIO. Tranio, let’s go. One thing more rests, that thyself execute, To make one among these wooers: if thou ask me why, Sufficeth my reasons are both good and weighty.  [_Exeunt._]  [_The Presenters above speak._]  FIRST SERVANT. My lord, you nod; you do not mind the play.  SLY. Yes, by Saint Anne, I do. A good matter, surely: comes there any more of it?  PAGE. My lord, ’tis but begun.  SLY. ’Tis a very excellent piece of work, madam lady: would ’twere done!  [_They sit and mark._]  SCENE II. Padua. Before Hortensio’s house.  Enter Petruchio and his man Grumio.  PETRUCHIO. Verona, for a while I take my leave, To see my friends in Padua; but of all My best beloved and approved friend, Hortensio; and I trow this is his house. Here, sirrah Grumio, knock, I say.  GRUMIO. Knock, sir? Whom should I knock? Is there any man has rebused your worship?  PETRUCHIO. Villain, I say, knock me here soundly.  GRUMIO. Knock you here, sir? Why, sir, what am I, sir, that I should knock you here, sir?  PETRUCHIO. Villain, I say, knock me at this gate; And rap me well, or I’ll knock your knave’s pate.  GRUMIO. My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock you first, And then I know after who comes by the worst.  PETRUCHIO. Will it not be? Faith, sirrah, and you’ll not knock, I’ll ring it; I’ll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it.  [_He wrings Grumio by the ears._]  GRUMIO. Help, masters, help! my master is mad.  PETRUCHIO. Now, knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!
Enter Hortensio.  HORTENSIO. How now! what’s the matter? My old friend Grumio! and my good friend Petruchio! How do you all at Verona?  PETRUCHIO. Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray? _Con tutto il cuore ben trovato_, may I say.  HORTENSIO. _Alla nostra casa ben venuto; molto honorato signor mio Petruchio._ Rise, Grumio, rise: we will compound this quarrel.  GRUMIO. Nay, ’tis no matter, sir, what he ’leges in Latin. If this be not a lawful cause for me to leave his service, look you, sir, he bid me knock him and rap him soundly, sir: well, was it fit for a servant to use his master so; being, perhaps, for aught I see, two-and-thirty, a pip out? Whom would to God I had well knock’d at first, then had not Grumio come by the worst.  PETRUCHIO. A senseless villain! Good Hortensio, I bade the rascal knock upon your gate, And could not get him for my heart to do it.  GRUMIO. Knock at the gate! O heavens! Spake you not these words plain: ‘Sirrah knock me here, rap me here, knock me well, and knock me soundly’? And come you now with ‘knocking at the gate’?  PETRUCHIO. Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.  HORTENSIO. Petruchio, patience; I am Grumio’s pledge; Why, this’s a heavy chance ’twixt him and you, Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio. And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?  PETRUCHIO. Such wind as scatters young men through the world To seek their fortunes farther than at home, Where small experience grows. But in a few, Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me: Antonio, my father, is deceas’d, And I have thrust myself into this maze, Haply to wive and thrive as best I may; Crowns in my purse I have, and goods at home, And so am come abroad to see the world.  HORTENSIO. Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour’d wife? Thou’dst thank me but a little for my counsel; And yet I’ll promise thee she shall be rich, And very rich: but th’art too much my friend, And I’ll not wish thee to her.  PETRUCHIO. Signior Hortensio, ’twixt such friends as we Few words suffice; and therefore, if thou know One rich enough to be Petruchio’s wife, As wealth is burden of my wooing dance, Be she as foul as was Florentius’ love, As old as Sibyl, and as curst and shrewd As Socrates’ Xanthippe or a worse, She moves me not, or not removes, at least, Affection’s edge in me, were she as rough As are the swelling Adriatic seas: I come to wive it wealthily in Padua; If wealthily, then happily in Padua.  GRUMIO. Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his mind is: why, give him gold enough and marry him to a puppet or an aglet-baby; or an old trot with ne’er a tooth in her head, though she have as many diseases as two-and-fifty horses: why, nothing comes amiss, so money comes withal.  HORTENSIO. Petruchio, since we are stepp’d thus far in, I will continue that I broach’d in jest. I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife With wealth enough, and young and beauteous; Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman: Her only fault,—and that is faults enough,— Is, that she is intolerable curst, And shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure, That, were my state far worser than it is, I would not wed her for a mine of gold.  PETRUCHIO. Hortensio, peace! thou know’st not gold’s effect: Tell me her father’s name, and ’tis enough; For I will board her, though she chide as loud As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.  HORTENSIO. Her father is Baptista Minola, An affable and courteous gentleman; Her name is Katherina Minola, Renown’d in Padua for her scolding tongue.  PETRUCHIO. I know her father, though I know not her; And he knew my deceased father well. I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her; And therefore let me be thus bold with you, To give you over at this first encounter, Unless you will accompany me thither.  GRUMIO. I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts. O’ my word, and she knew him as well as I do, she would think scolding would do little good upon him. She may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so; why, that’s nothing; and he begin once, he’ll rail in his rope-tricks. I’ll tell you what, sir, and she stand him but a little, he will throw a figure in her face, and so disfigure her with it that she shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat. You know him not, sir.  HORTENSIO. Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee, For in Baptista’s keep my treasure is: He hath the jewel of my life in hold, His youngest daughter, beautiful Bianca, And her withholds from me and other more, Suitors to her and rivals in my love; Supposing it a thing impossible, For those defects I have before rehears’d, That ever Katherina will be woo’d: Therefore this order hath Baptista ta’en, That none shall have access unto Bianca Till Katherine the curst have got a husband.  GRUMIO. Katherine the curst! A title for a maid of all titles the worst.  HORTENSIO. Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace, And offer me disguis’d in sober robes, To old Baptista as a schoolmaster Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca; That so I may, by this device at least Have leave and leisure to make love to her, And unsuspected court her by herself.  GRUMIO. Here’s no knavery! See, to beguile the old folks, how the young folks lay their heads together!
Enter Gremio and Lucentio disguised, with books under his arm.  Master, master, look about you: who goes there, ha?  HORTENSIO. Peace, Grumio! It is the rival of my love. Petruchio, stand by awhile.  GRUMIO. A proper stripling, and an amorous!  GREMIO. O! very well; I have perus’d the note. Hark you, sir; I’ll have them very fairly bound: All books of love, see that at any hand, And see you read no other lectures to her. You understand me. Over and beside Signior Baptista’s liberality, I’ll mend it with a largess. Take your papers too, And let me have them very well perfum’d; For she is sweeter than perfume itself To whom they go to. What will you read to her?  LUCENTIO. Whate’er I read to her, I’ll plead for you, As for my patron, stand you so assur’d, As firmly as yourself were still in place; Yea, and perhaps with more successful words Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir.  GREMIO. O! this learning, what a thing it is.  GRUMIO. O! this woodcock, what an ass it is.  PETRUCHIO. Peace, sirrah!  HORTENSIO. Grumio, mum! God save you, Signior Gremio!  GREMIO. And you are well met, Signior Hortensio. Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola. I promis’d to enquire carefully About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca; And by good fortune I have lighted well On this young man; for learning and behaviour Fit for her turn, well read in poetry And other books, good ones, I warrant ye.  HORTENSIO. ’Tis well; and I have met a gentleman Hath promis’d me to help me to another, A fine musician to instruct our mistress: So shall I no whit be behind in duty To fair Bianca, so belov’d of me.  GREMIO. Belov’d of me, and that my deeds shall prove.  GRUMIO. [_Aside._] And that his bags shall prove.  HORTENSIO. Gremio, ’tis now no time to vent our love: Listen to me, and if you speak me fair, I’ll tell you news indifferent good for either. Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met, Upon agreement from us to his liking, Will undertake to woo curst Katherine; Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please.  GREMIO. So said, so done, is well. Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?  PETRUCHIO. I know she is an irksome brawling scold; If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.  GREMIO. No, say’st me so, friend? What countryman?  PETRUCHIO. Born in Verona, old Antonio’s son. My father dead, my fortune lives for me; And I do hope good days and long to see.  GREMIO. O sir, such a life, with such a wife, were strange! But if you have a stomach, to’t a God’s name; You shall have me assisting you in all. But will you woo this wild-cat?  PETRUCHIO. Will I live?  GRUMIO. Will he woo her? Ay, or I’ll hang her.  PETRUCHIO. Why came I hither but to that intent? Think you a little din can daunt mine ears? Have I not in my time heard lions roar? Have I not heard the sea, puff’d up with winds, Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat? Have I not heard great ordnance in the field, And heaven’s artillery thunder in the skies? Have I not in a pitched battle heard Loud ’larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets’ clang? And do you tell me of a woman’s tongue, That gives not half so great a blow to hear As will a chestnut in a farmer’s fire? Tush, tush! fear boys with bugs.  GRUMIO. [_Aside_] For he fears none.  GREMIO. Hortensio, hark: This gentleman is happily arriv’d, My mind presumes, for his own good and yours.  HORTENSIO. I promis’d we would be contributors, And bear his charge of wooing, whatsoe’er.  GREMIO. And so we will, provided that he win her.  GRUMIO. I would I were as sure of a good dinner.
Enter Tranio brave, and Biondello.  TRANIO. Gentlemen, God save you! If I may be bold, Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way To the house of Signior Baptista Minola?  BIONDELLO. He that has the two fair daughters; is’t he you mean?  TRANIO. Even he, Biondello!  GREMIO. Hark you, sir, you mean not her to—  TRANIO. Perhaps him and her, sir; what have you to do?  PETRUCHIO. Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray.  TRANIO. I love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let’s away.  LUCENTIO. [_Aside_]  Well begun, Tranio.  HORTENSIO. Sir, a word ere you go. Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no?  TRANIO. And if I be, sir, is it any offence?  GREMIO. No; if without more words you will get you hence.  TRANIO. Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free For me as for you?  GREMIO. But so is not she.  TRANIO. For what reason, I beseech you?  GREMIO. For this reason, if you’ll know, That she’s the choice love of Signior Gremio.  HORTENSIO. That she’s the chosen of Signior Hortensio.  TRANIO. Softly, my masters! If you be gentlemen, Do me this right; hear me with patience. Baptista is a noble gentleman, To whom my father is not all unknown; And were his daughter fairer than she is, She may more suitors have, and me for one. Fair Leda’s daughter had a thousand wooers; Then well one more may fair Bianca have; And so she shall: Lucentio shall make one, Though Paris came in hope to speed alone.  GREMIO. What, this gentleman will out-talk us all.  LUCENTIO. Sir, give him head; I know he’ll prove a jade.  PETRUCHIO. Hortensio, to what end are all these words?  HORTENSIO. Sir, let me be so bold as ask you, Did you yet ever see Baptista’s daughter?  TRANIO. No, sir, but hear I do that he hath two, The one as famous for a scolding tongue As is the other for beauteous modesty.  PETRUCHIO. Sir, sir, the first’s for me; let her go by.  GREMIO. Yea, leave that labour to great Hercules, And let it be more than Alcides’ twelve.  PETRUCHIO. Sir, understand you this of me, in sooth: The youngest daughter, whom you hearken for, Her father keeps from all access of suitors, And will not promise her to any man Until the elder sister first be wed; The younger then is free, and not before.  TRANIO. If it be so, sir, that you are the man Must stead us all, and me amongst the rest; And if you break the ice, and do this feat, Achieve the elder, set the younger free For our access, whose hap shall be to have her Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.  HORTENSIO. Sir, you say well, and well you do conceive; And since you do profess to be a suitor, You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman, To whom we all rest generally beholding.  TRANIO. Sir, I shall not be slack; in sign whereof, Please ye we may contrive this afternoon, And quaff carouses to our mistress’ health; And do as adversaries do in law, Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.  GRUMIO, BIONDELLO. O excellent motion! Fellows, let’s be gone.  HORTENSIO. The motion’s good indeed, and be it so:— Petruchio, I shall be your _ben venuto_.  [_Exeunt._]
  ACT II  SCENE I. Padua. A room in Baptista’s house.
Enter Katherina and Bianca.  BIANCA. Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself, To make a bondmaid and a slave of me; That I disdain; but for these other gawds, Unbind my hands, I’ll pull them off myself, Yea, all my raiment, to my petticoat; Or what you will command me will I do, So well I know my duty to my elders.  KATHERINA. Of all thy suitors here I charge thee tell Whom thou lov’st best: see thou dissemble not.  BIANCA. Believe me, sister, of all the men alive I never yet beheld that special face Which I could fancy more than any other.  KATHERINA. Minion, thou liest. Is’t not Hortensio?  BIANCA. If you affect him, sister, here I swear I’ll plead for you myself but you shall have him.  KATHERINA. O! then, belike, you fancy riches more: You will have Gremio to keep you fair.  BIANCA. Is it for him you do envy me so? Nay, then you jest; and now I well perceive You have but jested with me all this while: I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands.  KATHERINA. If that be jest, then all the rest was so.  [_Strikes her._]
Enter Baptista.  BAPTISTA. Why, how now, dame! Whence grows this insolence? Bianca, stand aside. Poor girl! she weeps. Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her. For shame, thou hilding of a devilish spirit, Why dost thou wrong her that did ne’er wrong thee? When did she cross thee with a bitter word?  KATHERINA. Her silence flouts me, and I’ll be reveng’d.  [_Flies after Bianca._]  BAPTISTA. What! in my sight? Bianca, get thee in.  [_Exit Bianca._]  KATHERINA. What! will you not suffer me? Nay, now I see She is your treasure, she must have a husband; I must dance bare-foot on her wedding-day, And, for your love to her, lead apes in hell. Talk not to me: I will go sit and weep Till I can find occasion of revenge.  [_Exit._]  BAPTISTA.  Was ever gentleman thus griev’d as I? But who comes here?
Enter Gremio, with Lucentio in the habit of a mean man; Petruchio, with Hortensio as a musician; and Tranio, with Biondello bearing a lute and books.  GREMIO. Good morrow, neighbour Baptista.  BAPTISTA. Good morrow, neighbour Gremio. God save you, gentlemen!  PETRUCHIO. And you, good sir! Pray, have you not a daughter Call’d Katherina, fair and virtuous?  BAPTISTA. I have a daughter, sir, call’d Katherina.  GREMIO. You are too blunt: go to it orderly.  PETRUCHIO. You wrong me, Signior Gremio: give me leave. I am a gentleman of Verona, sir, That, hearing of her beauty and her wit, Her affability and bashful modesty, Her wondrous qualities and mild behaviour, Am bold to show myself a forward guest Within your house, to make mine eye the witness Of that report which I so oft have heard. And, for an entrance to my entertainment, I do present you with a man of mine,  [_Presenting Hortensio._]  Cunning in music and the mathematics, To instruct her fully in those sciences, Whereof I know she is not ignorant. Accept of him, or else you do me wrong: His name is Licio, born in Mantua.  BAPTISTA. Y’are welcome, sir, and he for your good sake; But for my daughter Katherine, this I know, She is not for your turn, the more my grief.  PETRUCHIO. I see you do not mean to part with her; Or else you like not of my company.  BAPTISTA. Mistake me not; I speak but as I find. Whence are you, sir? What may I call your name?  PETRUCHIO. Petruchio is my name, Antonio’s son; A man well known throughout all Italy.  BAPTISTA. I know him well: you are welcome for his sake.  GREMIO. Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray, Let us, that are poor petitioners, speak too. Backare! you are marvellous forward.  PETRUCHIO. O, pardon me, Signior Gremio; I would fain be doing.  GREMIO. I doubt it not, sir; but you will curse your wooing. Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I am sure of it. To express the like kindness, myself, that have been more kindly beholding to you than any, freely give unto you this young scholar,  [_Presenting Lucentio._]  that has been long studying at Rheims; as cunning in Greek, Latin, and other languages, as the other in music and mathematics. His name is Cambio; pray accept his service.  BAPTISTA. A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio; welcome, good Cambio. [_To Tranio._] But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger. May I be so bold to know the cause of your coming?  TRANIO. Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own, That, being a stranger in this city here, Do make myself a suitor to your daughter, Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous. Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me, In the preferment of the eldest sister. This liberty is all that I request, That, upon knowledge of my parentage, I may have welcome ’mongst the rest that woo, And free access and favour as the rest: And, toward the education of your daughters, I here bestow a simple instrument, And this small packet of Greek and Latin books: If you accept them, then their worth is great.  BAPTISTA. Lucentio is your name, of whence, I pray?  TRANIO. Of Pisa, sir; son to Vincentio.  BAPTISTA. A mighty man of Pisa: by report I know him well: you are very welcome, sir. [_To Hortensio_.] Take you the lute, [_To Lucentio_.] and you the set of books; You shall go see your pupils presently. Holla, within!
Enter a Servant.  Sirrah, lead these gentlemen To my daughters, and tell them both These are their tutors: bid them use them well.  [_Exeunt Servant with Hortensio, Lucentio and Biondello._]  We will go walk a little in the orchard, And then to dinner. You are passing welcome, And so I pray you all to think yourselves.  PETRUCHIO. Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste, And every day I cannot come to woo. You knew my father well, and in him me, Left solely heir to all his lands and goods, Which I have bettered rather than decreas’d: Then tell me, if I get your daughter’s love, What dowry shall I have with her to wife?  BAPTISTA. After my death, the one half of my lands, And in possession twenty thousand crowns.  PETRUCHIO. And, for that dowry, I’ll assure her of Her widowhood, be it that she survive me, In all my lands and leases whatsoever. Let specialities be therefore drawn between us, That covenants may be kept on either hand.  BAPTISTA. Ay, when the special thing is well obtain’d, That is, her love; for that is all in all.  PETRUCHIO. Why, that is nothing; for I tell you, father, I am as peremptory as she proud-minded; And where two raging fires meet together, They do consume the thing that feeds their fury: Though little fire grows great with little wind, Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all; So I to her, and so she yields to me; For I am rough and woo not like a babe.  BAPTISTA. Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed! But be thou arm’d for some unhappy words.  PETRUCHIO. Ay, to the proof, as mountains are for winds, That shake not though they blow perpetually.
Re-enter Hortensio, with his head broke.  BAPTISTA. How now, my friend! Why dost thou look so pale?  HORTENSIO. For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.  BAPTISTA. What, will my daughter prove a good musician?  HORTENSIO. I think she’ll sooner prove a soldier: Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.  BAPTISTA. Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?  HORTENSIO. Why, no; for she hath broke the lute to me. I did but tell her she mistook her frets, And bow’d her hand to teach her fingering; When, with a most impatient devilish spirit, ‘Frets, call you these?’ quoth she ‘I’ll fume with them’; And with that word she struck me on the head, And through the instrument my pate made way; And there I stood amazed for a while, As on a pillory, looking through the lute; While she did call me rascal fiddler, And twangling Jack, with twenty such vile terms, As had she studied to misuse me so.  PETRUCHIO. Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench! I love her ten times more than e’er I did: O! how I long to have some chat with her!  BAPTISTA. [_To Hortensio_.] Well, go with me, and be not so discomfited; Proceed in practice with my younger daughter; She’s apt to learn, and thankful for good turns. Signior Petruchio, will you go with us, Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?  PETRUCHIO. I pray you do.  [_Exeunt Baptista, Gremio, Tranio and Hortensio._]  I will attend her here, And woo her with some spirit when she comes. Say that she rail; why, then I’ll tell her plain She sings as sweetly as a nightingale: Say that she frown; I’ll say she looks as clear As morning roses newly wash’d with dew: Say she be mute, and will not speak a word; Then I’ll commend her volubility, And say she uttereth piercing eloquence: If she do bid me pack, I’ll give her thanks, As though she bid me stay by her a week: If she deny to wed, I’ll crave the day When I shall ask the banns, and when be married. But here she comes; and now, Petruchio, speak.
Enter Katherina.  Good morrow, Kate; for that’s your name, I hear.  KATHERINA. Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing: They call me Katherine that do talk of me.  PETRUCHIO. You lie, in faith, for you are call’d plain Kate, And bonny Kate, and sometimes Kate the curst; But, Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom, Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate, For dainties are all Kates, and therefore, Kate, Take this of me, Kate of my consolation; Hearing thy mildness prais’d in every town, Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded,— Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs,— Myself am mov’d to woo thee for my wife.  KATHERINA. Mov’d! in good time: let him that mov’d you hither Remove you hence. I knew you at the first, You were a moveable.  PETRUCHIO. Why, what’s a moveable?  KATHERINA. A joint-stool.  PETRUCHIO. Thou hast hit it: come, sit on me.  KATHERINA. Asses are made to bear, and so are you.  PETRUCHIO. Women are made to bear, and so are you.  KATHERINA. No such jade as bear you, if me you mean.  PETRUCHIO. Alas! good Kate, I will not burden thee; For, knowing thee to be but young and light,—  KATHERINA. Too light for such a swain as you to catch; And yet as heavy as my weight should be.  PETRUCHIO. Should be! should buz!  KATHERINA. Well ta’en, and like a buzzard.  PETRUCHIO. O, slow-wing’d turtle! shall a buzzard take thee?  KATHERINA. Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.  PETRUCHIO. Come, come, you wasp; i’ faith, you are too angry.  KATHERINA. If I be waspish, best beware my sting.  PETRUCHIO. My remedy is then to pluck it out.  KATHERINA. Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies.  PETRUCHIO. Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting? In his tail.  KATHERINA. In his tongue.  PETRUCHIO. Whose tongue?  KATHERINA. Yours, if you talk of tales; and so farewell.  PETRUCHIO. What! with my tongue in your tail? Nay, come again, Good Kate; I am a gentleman.  KATHERINA. That I’ll try.  [_Striking him._]  PETRUCHIO. I swear I’ll cuff you if you strike again.  KATHERINA. So may you lose your arms: If you strike me, you are no gentleman; And if no gentleman, why then no arms.  PETRUCHIO. A herald, Kate? O! put me in thy books.  KATHERINA. What is your crest? a coxcomb?  PETRUCHIO. A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.  KATHERINA. No cock of mine; you crow too like a craven.  PETRUCHIO. Nay, come, Kate, come; you must not look so sour.  KATHERINA. It is my fashion when I see a crab.  PETRUCHIO. Why, here’s no crab, and therefore look not sour.  KATHERINA. There is, there is.  PETRUCHIO. Then show it me.  KATHERINA. Had I a glass I would.  PETRUCHIO. What, you mean my face?  KATHERINA. Well aim’d of such a young one.  PETRUCHIO. Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.  KATHERINA. Yet you are wither’d.  PETRUCHIO. ’Tis with cares.  KATHERINA. I care not.  PETRUCHIO. Nay, hear you, Kate: in sooth, you ’scape not so.  KATHERINA. I chafe you, if I tarry; let me go.  PETRUCHIO. No, not a whit; I find you passing gentle. ’Twas told me you were rough, and coy, and sullen, And now I find report a very liar; For thou art pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous, But slow in speech, yet sweet as spring-time flowers. Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance, Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will, Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk; But thou with mildness entertain’st thy wooers; With gentle conference, soft and affable. Why does the world report that Kate doth limp? O sland’rous world! Kate like the hazel-twig Is straight and slender, and as brown in hue As hazel-nuts, and sweeter than the kernels. O! let me see thee walk: thou dost not halt.  KATHERINA. Go, fool, and whom thou keep’st command.  PETRUCHIO. Did ever Dian so become a grove As Kate this chamber with her princely gait? O! be thou Dian, and let her be Kate, And then let Kate be chaste, and Dian sportful!  KATHERINA. Where did you study all this goodly speech?  PETRUCHIO. It is extempore, from my mother-wit.  KATHERINA. A witty mother! witless else her son.  PETRUCHIO. Am I not wise?  KATHERINA. Yes; keep you warm.  PETRUCHIO. Marry, so I mean, sweet Katherine, in thy bed; And therefore, setting all this chat aside, Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented That you shall be my wife your dowry ’greed on; And will you, nill you, I will marry you. Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn; For, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,— Thy beauty that doth make me like thee well,— Thou must be married to no man but me; For I am he am born to tame you, Kate, And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate Conformable as other household Kates.
Re-enter Baptista, Gremio and Tranio.
Here comes your father. Never make denial; I must and will have Katherine to my wife.  BAPTISTA. Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter?  PETRUCHIO. How but well, sir? how but well? It were impossible I should speed amiss.  BAPTISTA. Why, how now, daughter Katherine, in your dumps?  KATHERINA. Call you me daughter? Now I promise you You have show’d a tender fatherly regard To wish me wed to one half lunatic, A mad-cap ruffian and a swearing Jack, That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.  PETRUCHIO. Father, ’tis thus: yourself and all the world That talk’d of her have talk’d amiss of her: If she be curst, it is for policy, For she’s not froward, but modest as the dove; She is not hot, but temperate as the morn; For patience she will prove a second Grissel, And Roman Lucrece for her chastity; And to conclude, we have ’greed so well together That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.  KATHERINA. I’ll see thee hang’d on Sunday first.  GREMIO. Hark, Petruchio; she says she’ll see thee hang’d first.  TRANIO. Is this your speeding? Nay, then good-night our part!  PETRUCHIO. Be patient, gentlemen. I choose her for myself; If she and I be pleas’d, what’s that to you? ’Tis bargain’d ’twixt us twain, being alone, That she shall still be curst in company. I tell you, ’tis incredible to believe How much she loves me: O! the kindest Kate She hung about my neck, and kiss on kiss She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath, That in a twink she won me to her love. O! you are novices: ’tis a world to see, How tame, when men and women are alone, A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew. Give me thy hand, Kate; I will unto Venice, To buy apparel ’gainst the wedding-day. Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests; I will be sure my Katherine shall be fine.  BAPTISTA. I know not what to say; but give me your hands. God send you joy, Petruchio! ’Tis a match.  GREMIO, TRANIO. Amen, say we; we will be witnesses.  PETRUCHIO. Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu. I will to Venice; Sunday comes apace; We will have rings and things, and fine array; And kiss me, Kate; we will be married o’ Sunday.  [_Exeunt Petruchio and Katherina, severally._]  GREMIO. Was ever match clapp’d up so suddenly?  BAPTISTA. Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant’s part, And venture madly on a desperate mart.  TRANIO. ’Twas a commodity lay fretting by you; ’Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.  BAPTISTA. The gain I seek is, quiet in the match.  GREMIO. No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch. But now, Baptista, to your younger daughter: Now is the day we long have looked for; I am your neighbour, and was suitor first.  TRANIO. And I am one that love Bianca more Than words can witness or your thoughts can guess.  GREMIO. Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.  TRANIO. Greybeard, thy love doth freeze.  GREMIO. But thine doth fry. Skipper, stand back; ’tis age that nourisheth.  TRANIO. But youth in ladies’ eyes that flourisheth.  BAPTISTA. Content you, gentlemen; I’ll compound this strife: ’Tis deeds must win the prize, and he of both That can assure my daughter greatest dower Shall have my Bianca’s love. Say, Signior Gremio, what can you assure her?  GREMIO. First, as you know, my house within the city Is richly furnished with plate and gold: Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands; My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry; In ivory coffers I have stuff’d my crowns; In cypress chests my arras counterpoints, Costly apparel, tents, and canopies, Fine linen, Turkey cushions boss’d with pearl, Valance of Venice gold in needlework; Pewter and brass, and all things that belong To house or housekeeping: then, at my farm I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail, Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls, And all things answerable to this portion. Myself am struck in years, I must confess; And if I die tomorrow this is hers, If whilst I live she will be only mine.  TRANIO. That ‘only’ came well in. Sir, list to me: I am my father’s heir and only son; If I may have your daughter to my wife, I’ll leave her houses three or four as good Within rich Pisa’s walls as anyone Old Signior Gremio has in Padua; Besides two thousand ducats by the year Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure. What, have I pinch’d you, Signior Gremio?  GREMIO. Two thousand ducats by the year of land! My land amounts not to so much in all: That she shall have, besides an argosy That now is lying in Marseilles’ road. What, have I chok’d you with an argosy?  TRANIO. Gremio, ’tis known my father hath no less Than three great argosies, besides two galliasses, And twelve tight galleys; these I will assure her, And twice as much, whate’er thou offer’st next.  GREMIO. Nay, I have offer’d all; I have no more; And she can have no more than all I have; If you like me, she shall have me and mine.  TRANIO. Why, then the maid is mine from all the world, By your firm promise; Gremio is out-vied.  BAPTISTA. I must confess your offer is the best; And let your father make her the assurance, She is your own; else, you must pardon me; If you should die before him, where’s her dower?  TRANIO. That’s but a cavil; he is old, I young.  GREMIO. And may not young men die as well as old?  BAPTISTA. Well, gentlemen, I am thus resolv’d. On Sunday next, you know, My daughter Katherine is to be married; Now, on the Sunday following, shall Bianca Be bride to you, if you make this assurance; If not, to Signior Gremio. And so I take my leave, and thank you both.  GREMIO. Adieu, good neighbour.  [_Exit Baptista._]  Now, I fear thee not: Sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool To give thee all, and in his waning age Set foot under thy table. Tut! a toy! An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy.  [_Exit._]  TRANIO. A vengeance on your crafty wither’d hide! Yet I have fac’d it with a card of ten. ’Tis in my head to do my master good: I see no reason but suppos’d Lucentio Must get a father, call’d suppos’d Vincentio; And that’s a wonder: fathers commonly Do get their children; but in this case of wooing A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.  [_Exit._]
  ACT III  SCENE I. Padua. A room in Baptista’s house.
Enter Lucentio, Hortensio and Bianca.  LUCENTIO. Fiddler, forbear; you grow too forward, sir. Have you so soon forgot the entertainment Her sister Katherine welcome’d you withal?  HORTENSIO. But, wrangling pedant, this is The patroness of heavenly harmony: Then give me leave to have prerogative; And when in music we have spent an hour, Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.  LUCENTIO. Preposterous ass, that never read so far To know the cause why music was ordain’d! Was it not to refresh the mind of man After his studies or his usual pain? Then give me leave to read philosophy, And while I pause serve in your harmony.  HORTENSIO. Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine.  BIANCA. Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong, To strive for that which resteth in my choice. I am no breeching scholar in the schools, I’ll not be tied to hours nor ’pointed times, But learn my lessons as I please myself. And, to cut off all strife, here sit we down; Take you your instrument, play you the whiles; His lecture will be done ere you have tun’d.  HORTENSIO. You’ll leave his lecture when I am in tune?  [_Retires._]  LUCENTIO. That will be never: tune your instrument.  BIANCA. Where left we last?  LUCENTIO. Here, madam:— _Hic ibat Simois; hic est Sigeia tellus; Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis._  BIANCA. Construe them.  LUCENTIO. _Hic ibat_, as I told you before, _Simois_, I am Lucentio, _hic est_, son unto Vincentio of Pisa, _Sigeia tellus_, disguised thus to get your love, _Hic steterat_, and that Lucentio that comes a-wooing, _Priami_, is my man Tranio, _regia_, bearing my port, _celsa senis_, that we might beguile the old pantaloon.  HORTENSIO. [_Returning._] Madam, my instrument’s in tune.  BIANCA. Let’s hear.—  [Hortensio _plays._]  O fie! the treble jars.  LUCENTIO. Spit in the hole, man, and tune again.  BIANCA. Now let me see if I can construe it: _Hic ibat Simois_, I know you not; _hic est Sigeia tellus_, I trust you not; _Hic steterat Priami_, take heed he hear us not; _regia_, presume not; _celsa senis_, despair not.  HORTENSIO. Madam, ’tis now in tune.  LUCENTIO. All but the base.  HORTENSIO. The base is right; ’tis the base knave that jars. [_Aside_] How fiery and forward our pedant is! Now, for my life, the knave doth court my love: Pedascule, I’ll watch you better yet.  BIANCA. In time I may believe, yet I mistrust.  LUCENTIO. Mistrust it not; for sure, Æacides Was Ajax, call’d so from his grandfather.  BIANCA. I must believe my master; else, I promise you, I should be arguing still upon that doubt; But let it rest. Now, Licio, to you. Good master, take it not unkindly, pray, That I have been thus pleasant with you both.  HORTENSIO. [_To Lucentio_] You may go walk and give me leave a while; My lessons make no music in three parts.  LUCENTIO. Are you so formal, sir? Well, I must wait, [_Aside_] And watch withal; for, but I be deceiv’d, Our fine musician groweth amorous.  HORTENSIO. Madam, before you touch the instrument, To learn the order of my fingering, I must begin with rudiments of art; To teach you gamut in a briefer sort, More pleasant, pithy, and effectual, Than hath been taught by any of my trade: And there it is in writing, fairly drawn.  BIANCA. Why, I am past my gamut long ago.  HORTENSIO. Yet read the gamut of Hortensio.  BIANCA.    _Gamut_ I am, the ground of all accord,      _A re_, to plead Hortensio’s passion;    _B mi_, Bianca, take him for thy lord,      _C fa ut_, that loves with all affection:    _D sol re_, one clef, two notes have I    _E la mi_, show pity or I die. Call you this gamut? Tut, I like it not: Old fashions please me best; I am not so nice, To change true rules for odd inventions.
Enter a Servant.  SERVANT. Mistress, your father prays you leave your books, And help to dress your sister’s chamber up: You know tomorrow is the wedding-day.  BIANCA. Farewell, sweet masters, both: I must be gone.  [_Exeunt Bianca and Servant._]  LUCENTIO. Faith, mistress, then I have no cause to stay.  [_Exit._]  HORTENSIO. But I have cause to pry into this pedant: Methinks he looks as though he were in love. Yet if thy thoughts, Bianca, be so humble To cast thy wand’ring eyes on every stale, Seize thee that list: if once I find thee ranging, Hortensio will be quit with thee by changing.  [_Exit._]  SCENE II. The same. Before Baptista’s house.  Enter Baptista, Gremio, Tranio, Katherina, Bianca, Lucentio and Attendants.  BAPTISTA.  [_To Tranio_.] Signior Lucentio, this is the ’pointed day That Katherine and Petruchio should be married, And yet we hear not of our son-in-law. What will be said? What mockery will it be To want the bridegroom when the priest attends To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage! What says Lucentio to this shame of ours?  KATHERINA. No shame but mine; I must, forsooth, be forc’d To give my hand, oppos’d against my heart, Unto a mad-brain rudesby, full of spleen; Who woo’d in haste and means to wed at leisure. I told you, I, he was a frantic fool, Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behaviour; And to be noted for a merry man, He’ll woo a thousand, ’point the day of marriage, Make friends, invite, and proclaim the banns; Yet never means to wed where he hath woo’d. Now must the world point at poor Katherine, And say ‘Lo! there is mad Petruchio’s wife, If it would please him come and marry her.’  TRANIO. Patience, good Katherine, and Baptista too. Upon my life, Petruchio means but well, Whatever fortune stays him from his word: Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise; Though he be merry, yet withal he’s honest.  KATHERINA. Would Katherine had never seen him though!  [_Exit weeping, followed by Bianca and others._]  BAPTISTA. Go, girl, I cannot blame thee now to weep, For such an injury would vex a very saint; Much more a shrew of thy impatient humour.
Enter Biondello.  Master, master! News! old news, and such news as you never heard of!  BAPTISTA. Is it new and old too? How may that be?  BIONDELLO. Why, is it not news to hear of Petruchio’s coming?  BAPTISTA. Is he come?  BIONDELLO. Why, no, sir.  BAPTISTA. What then?  BIONDELLO. He is coming.  BAPTISTA. When will he be here?  BIONDELLO. When he stands where I am and sees you there.  TRANIO. But say, what to thine old news?  BIONDELLO. Why, Petruchio is coming, in a new hat and an old jerkin; a pair of old breeches thrice turned; a pair of boots that have been candle-cases, one buckled, another laced; an old rusty sword ta’en out of the town armoury, with a broken hilt, and chapeless; with two broken points: his horse hipped with an old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred; besides, possessed with the glanders and like to mose in the chine; troubled with the lampass, infected with the fashions, full of windgalls, sped with spavins, rayed with the yellows, past cure of the fives, stark spoiled with the staggers, begnawn with the bots, swayed in the back and shoulder-shotten; near-legged before, and with a half-checked bit, and a head-stall of sheep’s leather, which, being restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath been often burst, and now repaired with knots; one girth six times pieced, and a woman’s crupper of velure, which hath two letters for her name fairly set down in studs, and here and there pieced with pack-thread.  BAPTISTA. Who comes with him?  BIONDELLO. O, sir! his lackey, for all the world caparisoned like the horse; with a linen stock on one leg and a kersey boot-hose on the other, gartered with a red and blue list; an old hat, and the humour of forty fancies prick’d in’t for a feather: a monster, a very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian footboy or a gentleman’s lackey.  TRANIO. ’Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion; Yet oftentimes he goes but mean-apparell’d.  BAPTISTA. I am glad he’s come, howsoe’er he comes.  BIONDELLO. Why, sir, he comes not.  BAPTISTA. Didst thou not say he comes?  BIONDELLO. Who? that Petruchio came?  BAPTISTA. Ay, that Petruchio came.  BIONDELLO. No, sir; I say his horse comes, with him on his back.  BAPTISTA. Why, that’s all one.  BIONDELLO.      Nay, by Saint Jamy,      I hold you a penny,      A horse and a man      Is more than one,      And yet not many.
Enter Petruchio and Grumio.  PETRUCHIO. Come, where be these gallants? Who is at home?  BAPTISTA. You are welcome, sir.  PETRUCHIO. And yet I come not well.  BAPTISTA. And yet you halt not.  TRANIO. Not so well apparell’d as I wish you were.  PETRUCHIO. Were it better, I should rush in thus. But where is Kate? Where is my lovely bride? How does my father? Gentles, methinks you frown; And wherefore gaze this goodly company, As if they saw some wondrous monument, Some comet or unusual prodigy?  BAPTISTA. Why, sir, you know this is your wedding-day: First were we sad, fearing you would not come; Now sadder, that you come so unprovided. Fie! doff this habit, shame to your estate, An eye-sore to our solemn festival.  TRANIO. And tell us what occasion of import Hath all so long detain’d you from your wife, And sent you hither so unlike yourself?  PETRUCHIO. Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear; Sufficeth I am come to keep my word, Though in some part enforced to digress; Which at more leisure I will so excuse As you shall well be satisfied withal. But where is Kate? I stay too long from her; The morning wears, ’tis time we were at church.  TRANIO. See not your bride in these unreverent robes; Go to my chamber, put on clothes of mine.  PETRUCHIO. Not I, believe me: thus I’ll visit her.  BAPTISTA. But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.  PETRUCHIO. Good sooth, even thus; therefore ha’ done with words; To me she’s married, not unto my clothes. Could I repair what she will wear in me As I can change these poor accoutrements, ’Twere well for Kate and better for myself. But what a fool am I to chat with you When I should bid good morrow to my bride, And seal the title with a lovely kiss!  [_Exeunt Petruchio, Grumio and Biondello._]  TRANIO. He hath some meaning in his mad attire. We will persuade him, be it possible, To put on better ere he go to church.  BAPTISTA. I’ll after him and see the event of this.  [_Exeunt Baptista, Gremio and Attendants._]  TRANIO. But, sir, to love concerneth us to add Her father’s liking; which to bring to pass, As I before imparted to your worship, I am to get a man,—whate’er he be It skills not much; we’ll fit him to our turn,— And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa, And make assurance here in Padua, Of greater sums than I have promised. So shall you quietly enjoy your hope, And marry sweet Bianca with consent.  LUCENTIO. Were it not that my fellow schoolmaster Doth watch Bianca’s steps so narrowly, ’Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage; Which once perform’d, let all the world say no, I’ll keep mine own despite of all the world.  TRANIO. That by degrees we mean to look into, And watch our vantage in this business. We’ll over-reach the greybeard, Gremio, The narrow-prying father, Minola, The quaint musician, amorous Licio; All for my master’s sake, Lucentio.
Re-enter Gremio.  Signior Gremio, came you from the church?  GREMIO. As willingly as e’er I came from school.  TRANIO. And is the bride and bridegroom coming home?  GREMIO. A bridegroom, say you? ’Tis a groom indeed, A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find.  TRANIO. Curster than she? Why, ’tis impossible.  GREMIO. Why, he’s a devil, a devil, a very fiend.  TRANIO. Why, she’s a devil, a devil, the devil’s dam.  GREMIO. Tut! she’s a lamb, a dove, a fool, to him. I’ll tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priest Should ask if Katherine should be his wife, ’Ay, by gogs-wouns’ quoth he, and swore so loud That, all amaz’d, the priest let fall the book; And as he stoop’d again to take it up, The mad-brain’d bridegroom took him such a cuff That down fell priest and book, and book and priest: ‘Now take them up,’ quoth he ‘if any list.’  TRANIO. What said the wench, when he rose again?  GREMIO. Trembled and shook, for why, he stamp’d and swore As if the vicar meant to cozen him. But after many ceremonies done, He calls for wine: ‘A health!’ quoth he, as if He had been abroad, carousing to his mates After a storm; quaff’d off the muscadel, And threw the sops all in the sexton’s face, Having no other reason But that his beard grew thin and hungerly And seem’d to ask him sops as he was drinking. This done, he took the bride about the neck, And kiss’d her lips with such a clamorous smack That at the parting all the church did echo. And I, seeing this, came thence for very shame; And after me, I know, the rout is coming. Such a mad marriage never was before. Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play.  [_Music plays._]
Enter Petruchio, Katherina, Bianca, Baptista, Hortensio, Grumio and Train.  PETRUCHIO. Gentlemen and friends, I thank you for your pains: I know you think to dine with me today, And have prepar’d great store of wedding cheer But so it is, my haste doth call me hence, And therefore here I mean to take my leave.  BAPTISTA. Is’t possible you will away tonight?  PETRUCHIO. I must away today before night come. Make it no wonder: if you knew my business, You would entreat me rather go than stay. And, honest company, I thank you all, That have beheld me give away myself To this most patient, sweet, and virtuous wife. Dine with my father, drink a health to me. For I must hence; and farewell to you all.  TRANIO. Let us entreat you stay till after dinner.  PETRUCHIO. It may not be.  GREMIO. Let me entreat you.  PETRUCHIO. It cannot be.  KATHERINA. Let me entreat you.  PETRUCHIO. I am content.  KATHERINA. Are you content to stay?  PETRUCHIO. I am content you shall entreat me stay; But yet not stay, entreat me how you can.  KATHERINA. Now, if you love me, stay.  PETRUCHIO. Grumio, my horse!  GRUMIO. Ay, sir, they be ready; the oats have eaten the horses.  KATHERINA. Nay, then, Do what thou canst, I will not go today; No, nor tomorrow, not till I please myself. The door is open, sir; there lies your way; You may be jogging whiles your boots are green; For me, I’ll not be gone till I please myself. ’Tis like you’ll prove a jolly surly groom That take it on you at the first so roundly.  PETRUCHIO. O Kate! content thee: prithee be not angry.  KATHERINA. I will be angry: what hast thou to do? Father, be quiet; he shall stay my leisure.  GREMIO. Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work.  KATHERINA. Gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinner: I see a woman may be made a fool, If she had not a spirit to resist.  PETRUCHIO. They shall go forward, Kate, at thy command. Obey the bride, you that attend on her; Go to the feast, revel and domineer, Carouse full measure to her maidenhead, Be mad and merry, or go hang yourselves: But for my bonny Kate, she must with me. Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret; I will be master of what is mine own. She is my goods, my chattels; she is my house, My household stuff, my field, my barn, My horse, my ox, my ass, my anything; And here she stands, touch her whoever dare; I’ll bring mine action on the proudest he That stops my way in Padua. Grumio, Draw forth thy weapon; we are beset with thieves; Rescue thy mistress, if thou be a man. Fear not, sweet wench; they shall not touch thee, Kate; I’ll buckler thee against a million.  [_Exeunt Petruchio, Katherina and Grumio._]  BAPTISTA. Nay, let them go, a couple of quiet ones.  GREMIO. Went they not quickly, I should die with laughing.  TRANIO. Of all mad matches, never was the like.  LUCENTIO. Mistress, what’s your opinion of your sister?  BIANCA. That, being mad herself, she’s madly mated.  GREMIO. I warrant him, Petruchio is Kated.  BAPTISTA. Neighbours and friends, though bride and bridegroom wants For to supply the places at the table, You know there wants no junkets at the feast. Lucentio, you shall supply the bridegroom’s place; And let Bianca take her sister’s room.  TRANIO. Shall sweet Bianca practise how to bride it?  BAPTISTA. She shall, Lucentio. Come, gentlemen, let’s go.  [_Exeunt._]
  ACT IV  SCENE I. A hall in Petruchio’s country house.
Enter Grumio.  GRUMIO. Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and all foul ways! Was ever man so beaten? Was ever man so ray’d? Was ever man so weary? I am sent before to make a fire, and they are coming after to warm them. Now, were not I a little pot and soon hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my tongue to the roof of my mouth, my heart in my belly, ere I should come by a fire to thaw me. But I with blowing the fire shall warm myself; for, considering the weather, a taller man than I will take cold. Holla, ho! Curtis!
Enter Curtis.  CURTIS. Who is that calls so coldly?  GRUMIO. A piece of ice: if thou doubt it, thou mayst slide from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run but my head and my neck. A fire, good Curtis.  CURTIS. Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?  GRUMIO. O, ay! Curtis, ay; and therefore fire, fire; cast on no water.  CURTIS. Is she so hot a shrew as she’s reported?  GRUMIO. She was, good Curtis, before this frost; but thou knowest winter tames man, woman, and beast; for it hath tamed my old master, and my new mistress, and myself, fellow Curtis.  CURTIS. Away, you three-inch fool! I am no beast.  GRUMIO. Am I but three inches? Why, thy horn is a foot; and so long am I at the least. But wilt thou make a fire, or shall I complain on thee to our mistress, whose hand,—she being now at hand,— thou shalt soon feel, to thy cold comfort, for being slow in thy hot office?  CURTIS. I prithee, good Grumio, tell me, how goes the world?  GRUMIO. A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine; and therefore fire. Do thy duty, and have thy duty, for my master and mistress are almost frozen to death.  CURTIS. There’s fire ready; and therefore, good Grumio, the news.  GRUMIO. Why, ‘Jack boy! ho, boy!’ and as much news as wilt thou.  CURTIS. Come, you are so full of cony-catching.  GRUMIO. Why, therefore, fire; for I have caught extreme cold. Where’s the cook? Is supper ready, the house trimmed, rushes strewed, cobwebs swept, the servingmen in their new fustian, their white stockings, and every officer his wedding-garment on? Be the Jacks fair within, the Jills fair without, and carpets laid, and everything in order?  CURTIS. All ready; and therefore, I pray thee, news.  GRUMIO. First, know my horse is tired; my master and mistress fallen out.  CURTIS. How?  GRUMIO. Out of their saddles into the dirt; and thereby hangs a tale.  CURTIS. Let’s ha’t, good Grumio.  GRUMIO. Lend thine ear.  CURTIS. Here.  GRUMIO. [_Striking him._] There.  CURTIS. This ’tis to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.  GRUMIO. And therefore ’tis called a sensible tale; and this cuff was but to knock at your ear and beseech listening. Now I begin: _Imprimis_, we came down a foul hill, my master riding behind my mistress,—  CURTIS. Both of one horse?  GRUMIO. What’s that to thee?  CURTIS. Why, a horse.  GRUMIO. Tell thou the tale: but hadst thou not crossed me, thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell, and she under her horse; thou shouldst have heard in how miry a place, how she was bemoiled; how he left her with the horse upon her; how he beat me because her horse stumbled; how she waded through the dirt to pluck him off me: how he swore; how she prayed, that never prayed before; how I cried; how the horses ran away; how her bridle was burst; how I lost my crupper; with many things of worthy memory, which now shall die in oblivion, and thou return unexperienced to thy grave.  CURTIS. By this reckoning he is more shrew than she.  GRUMIO. Ay; and that thou and the proudest of you all shall find when he comes home. But what talk I of this? Call forth Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip, Walter, Sugarsop, and the rest; let their heads be sleekly combed, their blue coats brush’d and their garters of an indifferent knit; let them curtsy with their left legs, and not presume to touch a hair of my master’s horse-tail till they kiss their hands. Are they all ready?  CURTIS. They are.  GRUMIO. Call them forth.  CURTIS. Do you hear? ho! You must meet my master to countenance my mistress.  GRUMIO. Why, she hath a face of her own.  CURTIS. Who knows not that?  GRUMIO. Thou, it seems, that calls for company to countenance her.  CURTIS. I call them forth to credit her.  GRUMIO. Why, she comes to borrow nothing of them.
Enter four or five Servants.  NATHANIEL. Welcome home, Grumio!  PHILIP. How now, Grumio!  JOSEPH. What, Grumio!  NICHOLAS. Fellow Grumio!  NATHANIEL. How now, old lad!  GRUMIO. Welcome, you; how now, you; what, you; fellow, you; and thus much for greeting. Now, my spruce companions, is all ready, and all things neat?  NATHANIEL. All things is ready. How near is our master?  GRUMIO. E’en at hand, alighted by this; and therefore be not,— Cock’s passion, silence! I hear my master.
Enter Petruchio and Katherina.  PETRUCHIO. Where be these knaves? What! no man at door To hold my stirrup nor to take my horse? Where is Nathaniel, Gregory, Philip?—  ALL SERVANTS. Here, here, sir; here, sir.  PETRUCHIO. Here, sir! here, sir! here, sir! here, sir! You logger-headed and unpolish’d grooms! What, no attendance? no regard? no duty? Where is the foolish knave I sent before?  GRUMIO. Here, sir; as foolish as I was before.  PETRUCHIO. You peasant swain! you whoreson malt-horse drudge! Did I not bid thee meet me in the park, And bring along these rascal knaves with thee?  GRUMIO. Nathaniel’s coat, sir, was not fully made, And Gabriel’s pumps were all unpink’d i’ the heel; There was no link to colour Peter’s hat, And Walter’s dagger was not come from sheathing; There was none fine but Adam, Ralph, and Gregory; The rest were ragged, old, and beggarly; Yet, as they are, here are they come to meet you.  PETRUCHIO. Go, rascals, go and fetch my supper in.  [_Exeunt some of the Servants._]  Where is the life that late I led?    Where are those—?  Sit down, Kate, and welcome. Food, food, food, food!
Re-enter Servants with supper.  Why, when, I say?—Nay, good sweet Kate, be merry.— Off with my boots, you rogues! you villains! when?    It was the friar of orders grey,    As he forth walked on his way: Out, you rogue! you pluck my foot awry:  [_Strikes him._]  Take that, and mend the plucking off the other. Be merry, Kate. Some water, here; what, ho! Where’s my spaniel Troilus? Sirrah, get you hence And bid my cousin Ferdinand come hither:  [_Exit Servant._]  One, Kate, that you must kiss and be acquainted with. Where are my slippers? Shall I have some water? Come, Kate, and wash, and welcome heartily.—  [_Servant lets the ewer fall. Petruchio strikes him._]  You whoreson villain! will you let it fall?  KATHERINA. Patience, I pray you; ’twas a fault unwilling.  PETRUCHIO. A whoreson, beetle-headed, flap-ear’d knave! Come, Kate, sit down; I know you have a stomach. Will you give thanks, sweet Kate, or else shall I?— What’s this? Mutton?  FIRST SERVANT. Ay.  PETRUCHIO. Who brought it?  PETER. I.  PETRUCHIO. ’Tis burnt; and so is all the meat. What dogs are these! Where is the rascal cook? How durst you, villains, bring it from the dresser, And serve it thus to me that love it not?  [_Throws the meat, etc., at them._]  There, take it to you, trenchers, cups, and all. You heedless joltheads and unmanner’d slaves! What! do you grumble? I’ll be with you straight.  KATHERINA. I pray you, husband, be not so disquiet; The meat was well, if you were so contented.  PETRUCHIO. I tell thee, Kate, ’twas burnt and dried away, And I expressly am forbid to touch it; For it engenders choler, planteth anger; And better ’twere that both of us did fast, Since, of ourselves, ourselves are choleric, Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh. Be patient; tomorrow ’t shall be mended. And for this night we’ll fast for company: Come, I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber.  [_Exeunt Petruchio, Katherina and Curtis._]  NATHANIEL. Peter, didst ever see the like?  PETER. He kills her in her own humour.
Re-enter Curtis.  GRUMIO. Where is he?  CURTIS. In her chamber, making a sermon of continency to her; And rails, and swears, and rates, that she, poor soul, Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak, And sits as one new risen from a dream. Away, away! for he is coming hither.  [_Exeunt._]
Re-enter Petruchio.  PETRUCHIO. Thus have I politicly begun my reign, And ’tis my hope to end successfully. My falcon now is sharp and passing empty. And till she stoop she must not be full-gorg’d, For then she never looks upon her lure. Another way I have to man my haggard, To make her come, and know her keeper’s call, That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites That bate and beat, and will not be obedient. She eat no meat today, nor none shall eat; Last night she slept not, nor tonight she shall not; As with the meat, some undeserved fault I’ll find about the making of the bed; And here I’ll fling the pillow, there the bolster, This way the coverlet, another way the sheets; Ay, and amid this hurly I intend That all is done in reverend care of her; And, in conclusion, she shall watch all night: And if she chance to nod I’ll rail and brawl, And with the clamour keep her still awake. This is a way to kill a wife with kindness; And thus I’ll curb her mad and headstrong humour. He that knows better how to tame a shrew, Now let him speak; ’tis charity to show.  [_Exit._]  SCENE II. Padua. Before Baptista’s house.  Enter Tranio and Hortensio.  TRANIO. Is ’t possible, friend Licio, that Mistress Bianca Doth fancy any other but Lucentio? I tell you, sir, she bears me fair in hand.  HORTENSIO. Sir, to satisfy you in what I have said, Stand by and mark the manner of his teaching.  [_They stand aside._]
Enter Bianca and Lucentio.  LUCENTIO. Now, mistress, profit you in what you read?  BIANCA. What, master, read you? First resolve me that.  LUCENTIO. I read that I profess, _The Art to Love_.  BIANCA. And may you prove, sir, master of your art!  LUCENTIO. While you, sweet dear, prove mistress of my heart.  [_They retire._]  HORTENSIO. Quick proceeders, marry! Now tell me, I pray, You that durst swear that your Mistress Bianca Lov’d none in the world so well as Lucentio.  TRANIO. O despiteful love! unconstant womankind! I tell thee, Licio, this is wonderful.  HORTENSIO. Mistake no more; I am not Licio. Nor a musician as I seem to be; But one that scorn to live in this disguise For such a one as leaves a gentleman And makes a god of such a cullion: Know, sir, that I am call’d Hortensio.  TRANIO. Signior Hortensio, I have often heard Of your entire affection to Bianca; And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness, I will with you, if you be so contented, Forswear Bianca and her love for ever.  HORTENSIO. See, how they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio, Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow Never to woo her more, but do forswear her, As one unworthy all the former favours That I have fondly flatter’d her withal.  TRANIO. And here I take the like unfeigned oath, Never to marry with her though she would entreat; Fie on her! See how beastly she doth court him!  HORTENSIO. Would all the world but he had quite forsworn! For me, that I may surely keep mine oath, I will be married to a wealthy widow Ere three days pass, which hath as long lov’d me As I have lov’d this proud disdainful haggard. And so farewell, Signior Lucentio. Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks, Shall win my love; and so I take my leave, In resolution as I swore before.  [_Exit Hortensio. Lucentio and Bianca advance._]  TRANIO. Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace As ’longeth to a lover’s blessed case! Nay, I have ta’en you napping, gentle love, And have forsworn you with Hortensio.  BIANCA. Tranio, you jest; but have you both forsworn me?  TRANIO. Mistress, we have.  LUCENTIO. Then we are rid of Licio.  TRANIO. I’ faith, he’ll have a lusty widow now, That shall be woo’d and wedded in a day.  BIANCA. God give him joy!  TRANIO. Ay, and he’ll tame her.  BIANCA. He says so, Tranio.  TRANIO. Faith, he is gone unto the taming-school.  BIANCA. The taming-school! What, is there such a place?  TRANIO. Ay, mistress; and Petruchio is the master, That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long, To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.
Enter Biondello, running.  BIONDELLO. O master, master! I have watch’d so long That I am dog-weary; but at last I spied An ancient angel coming down the hill Will serve the turn.  TRANIO. What is he, Biondello?  BIONDELLO. Master, a mercatante or a pedant, I know not what; but formal in apparel, In gait and countenance surely like a father.  LUCENTIO. And what of him, Tranio?  TRANIO. If he be credulous and trust my tale, I’ll make him glad to seem Vincentio, And give assurance to Baptista Minola, As if he were the right Vincentio. Take in your love, and then let me alone.  [_Exeunt Lucentio and Bianca._]
Enter a Pedant.  PEDANT. God save you, sir!  TRANIO. And you, sir! you are welcome. Travel you far on, or are you at the farthest?  PEDANT. Sir, at the farthest for a week or two; But then up farther, and as far as Rome; And so to Tripoli, if God lend me life.  TRANIO. What countryman, I pray?  PEDANT. Of Mantua.  TRANIO. Of Mantua, sir?  Marry, God forbid, And come to Padua, careless of your life!  PEDANT. My life, sir! How, I pray? for that goes hard.  TRANIO. ’Tis death for anyone in Mantua To come to Padua. Know you not the cause? Your ships are stay’d at Venice; and the Duke,— For private quarrel ’twixt your Duke and him,— Hath publish’d and proclaim’d it openly. ’Tis marvel, but that you are but newly come You might have heard it else proclaim’d about.  PEDANT. Alas, sir! it is worse for me than so; For I have bills for money by exchange From Florence, and must here deliver them.  TRANIO. Well, sir, to do you courtesy, This will I do, and this I will advise you: First, tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?  PEDANT. Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been, Pisa renowned for grave citizens.  TRANIO. Among them know you one Vincentio?  PEDANT. I know him not, but I have heard of him, A merchant of incomparable wealth.  TRANIO. He is my father, sir; and, sooth to say, In countenance somewhat doth resemble you.  BIONDELLO. [_Aside._]  As much as an apple doth an oyster, and all one.  TRANIO. To save your life in this extremity, This favour will I do you for his sake; And think it not the worst of all your fortunes That you are like to Sir Vincentio. His name and credit shall you undertake, And in my house you shall be friendly lodg’d; Look that you take upon you as you should! You understand me, sir; so shall you stay Till you have done your business in the city. If this be courtesy, sir, accept of it.  PEDANT. O, sir, I do; and will repute you ever The patron of my life and liberty.  TRANIO. Then go with me to make the matter good. This, by the way, I let you understand: My father is here look’d for every day To pass assurance of a dower in marriage ’Twixt me and one Baptista’s daughter here: In all these circumstances I’ll instruct you. Go with me to clothe you as becomes you.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. A room in Petruchio’s house.  Enter Katherina and Grumio.  GRUMIO. No, no, forsooth; I dare not for my life.  KATHERINA. The more my wrong, the more his spite appears. What, did he marry me to famish me? Beggars that come unto my father’s door Upon entreaty have a present alms; If not, elsewhere they meet with charity; But I, who never knew how to entreat, Nor never needed that I should entreat, Am starv’d for meat, giddy for lack of sleep; With oaths kept waking, and with brawling fed. And that which spites me more than all these wants, He does it under name of perfect love; As who should say, if I should sleep or eat ’Twere deadly sickness, or else present death. I prithee go and get me some repast; I care not what, so it be wholesome food.  GRUMIO. What say you to a neat’s foot?  KATHERINA. ’Tis passing good; I prithee let me have it.  GRUMIO. I fear it is too choleric a meat. How say you to a fat tripe finely broil’d?  KATHERINA. I like it well; good Grumio, fetch it me.  GRUMIO. I cannot tell; I fear ’tis choleric. What say you to a piece of beef and mustard?  KATHERINA. A dish that I do love to feed upon.  GRUMIO. Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little.  KATHERINA. Why then the beef, and let the mustard rest.  GRUMIO. Nay, then I will not: you shall have the mustard, Or else you get no beef of Grumio.  KATHERINA. Then both, or one, or anything thou wilt.  GRUMIO. Why then the mustard without the beef.  KATHERINA. Go, get thee gone, thou false deluding slave,  [_Beats him._]  That feed’st me with the very name of meat. Sorrow on thee and all the pack of you That triumph thus upon my misery! Go, get thee gone, I say.
Enter Petruchio with a dish of meat; and Hortensio.  PETRUCHIO. How fares my Kate? What, sweeting, all amort?  HORTENSIO. Mistress, what cheer?  KATHERINA. Faith, as cold as can be.  PETRUCHIO. Pluck up thy spirits; look cheerfully upon me. Here, love; thou seest how diligent I am, To dress thy meat myself, and bring it thee:  [_Sets the dish on a table._]  I am sure, sweet Kate, this kindness merits thanks. What! not a word? Nay, then thou lov’st it not, And all my pains is sorted to no proof. Here, take away this dish.  KATHERINA. I pray you, let it stand.  PETRUCHIO. The poorest service is repaid with thanks; And so shall mine, before you touch the meat.  KATHERINA. I thank you, sir.  HORTENSIO. Signior Petruchio, fie! you are to blame. Come, Mistress Kate, I’ll bear you company.  PETRUCHIO. [_Aside._]  Eat it up all, Hortensio, if thou lovest me. Much good do it unto thy gentle heart! Kate, eat apace: and now, my honey love, Will we return unto thy father’s house And revel it as bravely as the best, With silken coats and caps, and golden rings, With ruffs and cuffs and farthingales and things; With scarfs and fans and double change of bravery, With amber bracelets, beads, and all this knavery. What! hast thou din’d? The tailor stays thy leisure, To deck thy body with his ruffling treasure.
Enter Tailor.  Come, tailor, let us see these ornaments; Lay forth the gown.—
Enter Haberdasher.  What news with you, sir?  HABERDASHER. Here is the cap your worship did bespeak.  PETRUCHIO. Why, this was moulded on a porringer; A velvet dish: fie, fie! ’tis lewd and filthy: Why, ’tis a cockle or a walnut-shell, A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby’s cap: Away with it! come, let me have a bigger.  KATHERINA. I’ll have no bigger; this doth fit the time, And gentlewomen wear such caps as these.  PETRUCHIO. When you are gentle, you shall have one too, And not till then.  HORTENSIO. [_Aside_] That will not be in haste.  KATHERINA. Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak; And speak I will. I am no child, no babe. Your betters have endur’d me say my mind, And if you cannot, best you stop your ears. My tongue will tell the anger of my heart, Or else my heart, concealing it, will break; And rather than it shall, I will be free Even to the uttermost, as I please, in words.  PETRUCHIO. Why, thou say’st true; it is a paltry cap, A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie; I love thee well in that thou lik’st it not.  KATHERINA. Love me or love me not, I like the cap; And it I will have, or I will have none.  [_Exit Haberdasher._]  PETRUCHIO. Thy gown? Why, ay: come, tailor, let us see’t. O mercy, God! what masquing stuff is here? What’s this? A sleeve? ’Tis like a demi-cannon. What, up and down, carv’d like an apple tart? Here’s snip and nip and cut and slish and slash, Like to a censer in a barber’s shop. Why, what i’ devil’s name, tailor, call’st thou this?  HORTENSIO. [_Aside_] I see she’s like to have neither cap nor gown.  TAILOR. You bid me make it orderly and well, According to the fashion and the time.  PETRUCHIO. Marry, and did; but if you be remember’d, I did not bid you mar it to the time. Go, hop me over every kennel home, For you shall hop without my custom, sir. I’ll none of it: hence! make your best of it.  KATHERINA. I never saw a better fashion’d gown, More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable; Belike you mean to make a puppet of me.  PETRUCHIO. Why, true; he means to make a puppet of thee.  TAILOR. She says your worship means to make a puppet of her.  PETRUCHIO. O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, thou thread, Thou thimble, Thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail! Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter-cricket thou! Brav’d in mine own house with a skein of thread! Away! thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant, Or I shall so be-mete thee with thy yard As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou liv’st! I tell thee, I, that thou hast marr’d her gown.  TAILOR. Your worship is deceiv’d: the gown is made Just as my master had direction. Grumio gave order how it should be done.  GRUMIO. I gave him no order; I gave him the stuff.  TAILOR. But how did you desire it should be made?  GRUMIO. Marry, sir, with needle and thread.  TAILOR. But did you not request to have it cut?  GRUMIO. Thou hast faced many things.  TAILOR. I have.  GRUMIO. Face not me. Thou hast braved many men; brave not me: I will neither be fac’d nor brav’d. I say unto thee, I bid thy master cut out the gown; but I did not bid him cut it to pieces: ergo, thou liest.  TAILOR. Why, here is the note of the fashion to testify.  PETRUCHIO. Read it.  GRUMIO. The note lies in ’s throat, if he say I said so.  TAILOR. ’Imprimis, a loose-bodied gown.’  GRUMIO. Master, if ever I said loose-bodied gown, sew me in the skirts of it and beat me to death with a bottom of brown thread; I said, a gown.  PETRUCHIO. Proceed.  TAILOR. ‘With a small compassed cape.’  GRUMIO. I confess the cape.  TAILOR. ‘With a trunk sleeve.’  GRUMIO. I confess two sleeves.  TAILOR. ‘The sleeves curiously cut.’  PETRUCHIO. Ay, there’s the villainy.  GRUMIO. Error i’ the bill, sir; error i’ the bill. I commanded the sleeves should be cut out, and sew’d up again; and that I’ll prove upon thee, though thy little finger be armed in a thimble.  TAILOR. This is true that I say; and I had thee in place where thou shouldst know it.  GRUMIO. I am for thee straight; take thou the bill, give me thy mete-yard, and spare not me.  HORTENSIO. God-a-mercy, Grumio! Then he shall have no odds.  PETRUCHIO. Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me.  GRUMIO. You are i’ the right, sir; ’tis for my mistress.  PETRUCHIO. Go, take it up unto thy master’s use.  GRUMIO. Villain, not for thy life! Take up my mistress’ gown for thy master’s use!  PETRUCHIO. Why, sir, what’s your conceit in that?  GRUMIO. O, sir, the conceit is deeper than you think for. Take up my mistress’ gown to his master’s use! O fie, fie, fie!  PETRUCHIO. [_Aside_]  Hortensio, say thou wilt see the tailor paid. [_To Tailor._] Go take it hence; be gone, and say no more.  HORTENSIO. [_Aside to Tailor._] Tailor, I’ll pay thee for thy gown tomorrow; Take no unkindness of his hasty words. Away, I say! commend me to thy master.  [_Exit Tailor._]  PETRUCHIO. Well, come, my Kate; we will unto your father’s Even in these honest mean habiliments. Our purses shall be proud, our garments poor For ’tis the mind that makes the body rich; And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds, So honour peereth in the meanest habit. What, is the jay more precious than the lark Because his feathers are more beautiful? Or is the adder better than the eel Because his painted skin contents the eye? O no, good Kate; neither art thou the worse For this poor furniture and mean array. If thou account’st it shame, lay it on me; And therefore frolic; we will hence forthwith, To feast and sport us at thy father’s house. Go call my men, and let us straight to him; And bring our horses unto Long-lane end; There will we mount, and thither walk on foot. Let’s see; I think ’tis now some seven o’clock, And well we may come there by dinner-time.  KATHERINA. I dare assure you, sir, ’tis almost two, And ’twill be supper-time ere you come there.  PETRUCHIO. It shall be seven ere I go to horse. Look what I speak, or do, or think to do, You are still crossing it. Sirs, let ’t alone: I will not go today; and ere I do, It shall be what o’clock I say it is.  HORTENSIO. Why, so this gallant will command the sun.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IV. Padua. Before Baptista’s house.  Enter Tranio and the Pedant dressed like Vincentio  TRANIO. Sir, this is the house; please it you that I call?  PEDANT. Ay, what else? and, but I be deceived, Signior Baptista may remember me, Near twenty years ago in Genoa, Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus.  TRANIO. ’Tis well; and hold your own, in any case, With such austerity as ’longeth to a father.  PEDANT. I warrant you. But, sir, here comes your boy; ’Twere good he were school’d.
Enter Biondello.  TRANIO. Fear you not him. Sirrah Biondello, Now do your duty throughly, I advise you. Imagine ’twere the right Vincentio.  BIONDELLO. Tut! fear not me.  TRANIO. But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?  BIONDELLO. I told him that your father was at Venice, And that you look’d for him this day in Padua.  TRANIO. Th’art a tall fellow; hold thee that to drink. Here comes Baptista. Set your countenance, sir.
Enter Baptista and Lucentio.  Signior Baptista, you are happily met. [_To the Pedant_] Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of; I pray you stand good father to me now; Give me Bianca for my patrimony.  PEDANT. Soft, son! Sir, by your leave: having come to Padua To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio Made me acquainted with a weighty cause Of love between your daughter and himself: And,—for the good report I hear of you, And for the love he beareth to your daughter, And she to him,—to stay him not too long, I am content, in a good father’s care, To have him match’d; and, if you please to like No worse than I, upon some agreement Me shall you find ready and willing With one consent to have her so bestow’d; For curious I cannot be with you, Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so well.  BAPTISTA. Sir, pardon me in what I have to say. Your plainness and your shortness please me well. Right true it is your son Lucentio here Doth love my daughter, and she loveth him, Or both dissemble deeply their affections; And therefore, if you say no more than this, That like a father you will deal with him, And pass my daughter a sufficient dower, The match is made, and all is done: Your son shall have my daughter with consent.  TRANIO. I thank you, sir. Where then do you know best We be affied, and such assurance ta’en As shall with either part’s agreement stand?  BAPTISTA. Not in my house, Lucentio, for you know Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants; Besides, old Gremio is hearkening still, And happily we might be interrupted.  TRANIO. Then at my lodging, and it like you: There doth my father lie; and there this night We’ll pass the business privately and well. Send for your daughter by your servant here; My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently. The worst is this, that at so slender warning You are like to have a thin and slender pittance.  BAPTISTA. It likes me well. Cambio, hie you home, And bid Bianca make her ready straight; And, if you will, tell what hath happened: Lucentio’s father is arriv’d in Padua, And how she’s like to be Lucentio’s wife.  LUCENTIO. I pray the gods she may, with all my heart!  TRANIO. Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone. Signior Baptista, shall I lead the way? Welcome! One mess is like to be your cheer; Come, sir; we will better it in Pisa.  BAPTISTA. I follow you.  [_Exeunt Tranio, Pedant and Baptista._]  BIONDELLO. Cambio!  LUCENTIO. What say’st thou, Biondello?  BIONDELLO. You saw my master wink and laugh upon you?  LUCENTIO. Biondello, what of that?  BIONDELLO. Faith, nothing; but has left me here behind to expound the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens.  LUCENTIO. I pray thee moralize them.  BIONDELLO. Then thus: Baptista is safe, talking with the deceiving father of a deceitful son.  LUCENTIO. And what of him?  BIONDELLO. His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper.  LUCENTIO. And then?  BIONDELLO. The old priest at Saint Luke’s church is at your command at all hours.  LUCENTIO. And what of all this?  BIONDELLO. I cannot tell, except they are busied about a counterfeit assurance. Take your assurance of her, _cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum_; to the church! take the priest, clerk, and some sufficient honest witnesses. If this be not that you look for, I have more to say, But bid Bianca farewell for ever and a day.  [_Going._]  LUCENTIO. Hear’st thou, Biondello?  BIONDELLO. I cannot tarry: I knew a wench married in an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit; and so may you, sir; and so adieu, sir. My master hath appointed me to go to Saint Luke’s to bid the priest be ready to come against you come with your appendix.  [_Exit._]  LUCENTIO. I may, and will, if she be so contented. She will be pleas’d; then wherefore should I doubt? Hap what hap may, I’ll roundly go about her; It shall go hard if Cambio go without her:  [_Exit._]  SCENE V. A public road.  Enter Petruchio, Katherina, Hortensio and Servants.  PETRUCHIO. Come on, i’ God’s name; once more toward our father’s. Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon!  KATHERINA. The moon! The sun; it is not moonlight now.  PETRUCHIO. I say it is the moon that shines so bright.  KATHERINA. I know it is the sun that shines so bright.  PETRUCHIO. Now by my mother’s son, and that’s myself, It shall be moon, or star, or what I list, Or ere I journey to your father’s house. Go on and fetch our horses back again. Evermore cross’d and cross’d; nothing but cross’d!  HORTENSIO. Say as he says, or we shall never go.  KATHERINA. Forward, I pray, since we have come so far, And be it moon, or sun, or what you please; And if you please to call it a rush-candle, Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me.  PETRUCHIO. I say it is the moon.  KATHERINA. I know it is the moon.  PETRUCHIO. Nay, then you lie; it is the blessed sun.  KATHERINA. Then, God be bless’d, it is the blessed sun; But sun it is not when you say it is not, And the moon changes even as your mind. What you will have it nam’d, even that it is, And so it shall be so for Katherine.  HORTENSIO. Petruchio, go thy ways; the field is won.  PETRUCHIO. Well, forward, forward! thus the bowl should run, And not unluckily against the bias. But, soft! Company is coming here.
Enter Vincentio, in a travelling dress.  [_To Vincentio_] Good morrow, gentle mistress; where away? Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly too, Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman? Such war of white and red within her cheeks! What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty As those two eyes become that heavenly face? Fair lovely maid, once more good day to thee. Sweet Kate, embrace her for her beauty’s sake.  HORTENSIO. A will make the man mad, to make a woman of him.  KATHERINA. Young budding virgin, fair and fresh and sweet, Whither away, or where is thy abode? Happy the parents of so fair a child; Happier the man whom favourable stars Allot thee for his lovely bedfellow.  PETRUCHIO. Why, how now, Kate! I hope thou art not mad: This is a man, old, wrinkled, faded, wither’d, And not a maiden, as thou sayst he is.  KATHERINA. Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes, That have been so bedazzled with the sun That everything I look on seemeth green: Now I perceive thou art a reverend father; Pardon, I pray thee, for my mad mistaking.  PETRUCHIO. Do, good old grandsire, and withal make known Which way thou travellest: if along with us, We shall be joyful of thy company.  VINCENTIO. Fair sir, and you my merry mistress, That with your strange encounter much amaz’d me, My name is called Vincentio; my dwelling Pisa; And bound I am to Padua, there to visit A son of mine, which long I have not seen.  PETRUCHIO. What is his name?  VINCENTIO. Lucentio, gentle sir.  PETRUCHIO. Happily met; the happier for thy son. And now by law, as well as reverend age, I may entitle thee my loving father: The sister to my wife, this gentlewoman, Thy son by this hath married. Wonder not, Nor be not griev’d: she is of good esteem, Her dowry wealthy, and of worthy birth; Beside, so qualified as may beseem The spouse of any noble gentleman. Let me embrace with old Vincentio; And wander we to see thy honest son, Who will of thy arrival be full joyous.  VINCENTIO. But is this true? or is it else your pleasure, Like pleasant travellers, to break a jest Upon the company you overtake?  HORTENSIO. I do assure thee, father, so it is.  PETRUCHIO. Come, go along, and see the truth hereof; For our first merriment hath made thee jealous.  [_Exeunt all but Hortensio._]  HORTENSIO. Well, Petruchio, this has put me in heart. Have to my widow! and if she be froward, Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward.  [_Exit._]
  ACT V  SCENE I. Padua. Before Lucentio’s house.
Enter on one side Biondello, Lucentio and Bianca; Gremio walking on other side.  BIONDELLO. Softly and swiftly, sir, for the priest is ready.  LUCENTIO. I fly, Biondello; but they may chance to need thee at home, therefore leave us.  BIONDELLO. Nay, faith, I’ll see the church o’ your back; and then come back to my master’s as soon as I can.  [_Exeunt Lucentio, Bianca and Biondello._]  GREMIO. I marvel Cambio comes not all this while.
Enter Petruchio, Katherina, Vincentio and Attendants.  PETRUCHIO. Sir, here’s the door; this is Lucentio’s house: My father’s bears more toward the market-place; Thither must I, and here I leave you, sir.  VINCENTIO. You shall not choose but drink before you go. I think I shall command your welcome here, And by all likelihood some cheer is toward.  [_Knocks._]  GREMIO. They’re busy within; you were best knock louder.
Enter Pedant above, at a window.  PEDANT. What’s he that knocks as he would beat down the gate?  VINCENTIO. Is Signior Lucentio within, sir?  PEDANT. He’s within, sir, but not to be spoken withal.  VINCENTIO. What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two to make merry withal?  PEDANT. Keep your hundred pounds to yourself: he shall need none so long as I live.  PETRUCHIO. Nay, I told you your son was well beloved in Padua. Do you hear, sir? To leave frivolous circumstances, I pray you tell Signior Lucentio that his father is come from Pisa, and is here at the door to speak with him.  PEDANT. Thou liest: his father is come from Padua, and here looking out at the window.  VINCENTIO. Art thou his father?  PEDANT. Ay, sir; so his mother says, if I may believe her.  PETRUCHIO. [_To Vincentio_]  Why, how now, gentleman! why, this is flat knavery to take upon you another man’s name.  PEDANT. Lay hands on the villain: I believe a means to cozen somebody in this city under my countenance.
Re-enter Biondello.  BIONDELLO. I have seen them in the church together: God send ’em good shipping! But who is here? Mine old master, Vincentio! Now we are undone and brought to nothing.  VINCENTIO. [_Seeing Biondello._] Come hither, crack-hemp.  BIONDELLO. I hope I may choose, sir.  VINCENTIO. Come hither, you rogue. What, have you forgot me?  BIONDELLO. Forgot you! No, sir: I could not forget you, for I never saw you before in all my life.  VINCENTIO. What, you notorious villain! didst thou never see thy master’s father, Vincentio?  BIONDELLO. What, my old worshipful old master? Yes, marry, sir; see where he looks out of the window.  VINCENTIO. Is’t so, indeed?  [_He beats Biondello._]  BIONDELLO. Help, help, help! here’s a madman will murder me.  [_Exit._]  PEDANT. Help, son! help, Signior Baptista!  [_Exit from the window._]  PETRUCHIO. Prithee, Kate, let’s stand aside and see the end of this controversy.  [_They retire._]
Re-enter Pedant, below; Baptista, Tranio and Servants.  TRANIO. Sir, what are you that offer to beat my servant?  VINCENTIO. What am I, sir! nay, what are you, sir? O immortal gods! O fine villain! A silken doublet, a velvet hose, a scarlet cloak, and a copatain hat! O, I am undone! I am undone! While I play the good husband at home, my son and my servant spend all at the university.  TRANIO. How now! what’s the matter?  BAPTISTA. What, is the man lunatic?  TRANIO. Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your habit, but your words show you a madman. Why, sir, what ’cerns it you if I wear pearl and gold? I thank my good father, I am able to maintain it.  VINCENTIO. Thy father! O villain! he is a sailmaker in Bergamo.  BAPTISTA. You mistake, sir; you mistake, sir. Pray, what do you think is his name?  VINCENTIO. His name! As if I knew not his name! I have brought him up ever since he was three years old, and his name is Tranio.  PEDANT. Away, away, mad ass! His name is Lucentio; and he is mine only son, and heir to the lands of me, Signior Vincentio.  VINCENTIO. Lucentio! O, he hath murdered his master! Lay hold on him, I charge you, in the Duke’s name. O, my son, my son! Tell me, thou villain, where is my son, Lucentio?  TRANIO. Call forth an officer.
Enter one with an Officer.  Carry this mad knave to the gaol. Father Baptista, I charge you see that he be forthcoming.  VINCENTIO. Carry me to the gaol!  GREMIO. Stay, officer; he shall not go to prison.  BAPTISTA. Talk not, Signior Gremio; I say he shall go to prison.  GREMIO. Take heed, Signior Baptista, lest you be cony-catched in this business; I dare swear this is the right Vincentio.  PEDANT. Swear if thou darest.  GREMIO. Nay, I dare not swear it.  TRANIO. Then thou wert best say that I am not Lucentio.  GREMIO. Yes, I know thee to be Signior Lucentio.  BAPTISTA. Away with the dotard! to the gaol with him!  VINCENTIO. Thus strangers may be haled and abus’d: O monstrous villain!
Re-enter Biondello, with Lucentio and Bianca.  BIONDELLO. O! we are spoiled; and yonder he is: deny him, forswear him, or else we are all undone.  LUCENTIO. [_Kneeling._] Pardon, sweet father.  VINCENTIO. Lives my sweetest son?  [_Biondello, Tranio and Pedant run out._]  BIANCA. [_Kneeling._] Pardon, dear father.  BAPTISTA. How hast thou offended? Where is Lucentio?  LUCENTIO. Here’s Lucentio, Right son to the right Vincentio; That have by marriage made thy daughter mine, While counterfeit supposes blear’d thine eyne.  GREMIO. Here ’s packing, with a witness, to deceive us all!  VINCENTIO. Where is that damned villain, Tranio, That fac’d and brav’d me in this matter so?  BAPTISTA. Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?  BIANCA. Cambio is chang’d into Lucentio.  LUCENTIO. Love wrought these miracles. Bianca’s love Made me exchange my state with Tranio, While he did bear my countenance in the town; And happily I have arriv’d at the last Unto the wished haven of my bliss. What Tranio did, myself enforc’d him to; Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake.  VINCENTIO. I’ll slit the villain’s nose that would have sent me to the gaol.  BAPTISTA. [_To Lucentio._] But do you hear, sir? Have you married my daughter without asking my good will?  VINCENTIO. Fear not, Baptista; we will content you, go to: but I will in, to be revenged for this villainy.  [_Exit._]  BAPTISTA. And I to sound the depth of this knavery.  [_Exit._]  LUCENTIO. Look not pale, Bianca; thy father will not frown.  [_Exeunt Lucentio and Bianca._]  GREMIO. My cake is dough, but I’ll in among the rest; Out of hope of all but my share of the feast.  [_Exit._]
Petruchio and Katherina advance.  KATHERINA. Husband, let’s follow to see the end of this ado.  PETRUCHIO. First kiss me, Kate, and we will.  KATHERINA. What! in the midst of the street?  PETRUCHIO. What! art thou ashamed of me?  KATHERINA. No, sir; God forbid; but ashamed to kiss.  PETRUCHIO. Why, then, let’s home again. Come, sirrah, let’s away.  KATHERINA. Nay, I will give thee a kiss: now pray thee, love, stay.  PETRUCHIO. Is not this well? Come, my sweet Kate: Better once than never, for never too late.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. A room in Lucentio’s house.  Enter Baptista, Vincentio, Gremio, the Pedant, Lucentio, Bianca, Petruchio, Katherina, Hortensio and Widow. Tranio, Biondello and Grumio and Others, attending.  LUCENTIO. At last, though long, our jarring notes agree: And time it is when raging war is done, To smile at ’scapes and perils overblown. My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome, While I with self-same kindness welcome thine. Brother Petruchio, sister Katherina, And thou, Hortensio, with thy loving widow, Feast with the best, and welcome to my house: My banquet is to close our stomachs up, After our great good cheer. Pray you, sit down; For now we sit to chat as well as eat.  [_They sit at table._]  PETRUCHIO. Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!  BAPTISTA. Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio.  PETRUCHIO. Padua affords nothing but what is kind.  HORTENSIO. For both our sakes I would that word were true.  PETRUCHIO. Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow.  WIDOW. Then never trust me if I be afeard.  PETRUCHIO. You are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense: I mean Hortensio is afeard of you.  WIDOW. He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.  PETRUCHIO. Roundly replied.  KATHERINA. Mistress, how mean you that?  WIDOW. Thus I conceive by him.  PETRUCHIO. Conceives by me! How likes Hortensio that?  HORTENSIO. My widow says thus she conceives her tale.  PETRUCHIO. Very well mended. Kiss him for that, good widow.  KATHERINA. ’He that is giddy thinks the world turns round’: I pray you tell me what you meant by that.  WIDOW. Your husband, being troubled with a shrew, Measures my husband’s sorrow by his woe; And now you know my meaning.  KATHERINA. A very mean meaning.  WIDOW. Right, I mean you.  KATHERINA. And I am mean, indeed, respecting you.  PETRUCHIO. To her, Kate!  HORTENSIO. To her, widow!  PETRUCHIO. A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down.  HORTENSIO. That’s my office.  PETRUCHIO. Spoke like an officer: ha’ to thee, lad.  [_Drinks to Hortensio._]  BAPTISTA. How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?  GREMIO. Believe me, sir, they butt together well.  BIANCA. Head and butt! An hasty-witted body Would say your head and butt were head and horn.  VINCENTIO. Ay, mistress bride, hath that awaken’d you?  BIANCA. Ay, but not frighted me; therefore I’ll sleep again.  PETRUCHIO. Nay, that you shall not; since you have begun, Have at you for a bitter jest or two.  BIANCA. Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush, And then pursue me as you draw your bow. You are welcome all.  [_Exeunt Bianca, Katherina and Widow._]  PETRUCHIO. She hath prevented me. Here, Signior Tranio; This bird you aim’d at, though you hit her not: Therefore a health to all that shot and miss’d.  TRANIO. O, sir! Lucentio slipp’d me like his greyhound, Which runs himself, and catches for his master.  PETRUCHIO. A good swift simile, but something currish.  TRANIO. ’Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself: ’Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.  BAPTISTA. O ho, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now.  LUCENTIO. I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio.  HORTENSIO. Confess, confess; hath he not hit you here?  PETRUCHIO. A has a little gall’d me, I confess; And as the jest did glance away from me, ’Tis ten to one it maim’d you two outright.  BAPTISTA. Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio, I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.  PETRUCHIO. Well, I say no; and therefore, for assurance, Let’s each one send unto his wife, And he whose wife is most obedient, To come at first when he doth send for her, Shall win the wager which we will propose.  HORTENSIO. Content. What’s the wager?  LUCENTIO. Twenty crowns.  PETRUCHIO. Twenty crowns! I’ll venture so much of my hawk or hound, But twenty times so much upon my wife.  LUCENTIO. A hundred then.  HORTENSIO. Content.  PETRUCHIO. A match! ’tis done.  HORTENSIO. Who shall begin?  LUCENTIO. That will I. Go, Biondello, bid your mistress come to me.  BIONDELLO. I go.  [_Exit._]  BAPTISTA. Son, I’ll be your half, Bianca comes.  LUCENTIO. I’ll have no halves; I’ll bear it all myself.
Re-enter Biondello.  How now! what news?  BIONDELLO. Sir, my mistress sends you word That she is busy and she cannot come.  PETRUCHIO. How! She’s busy, and she cannot come! Is that an answer?  GREMIO. Ay, and a kind one too: Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse.  PETRUCHIO. I hope better.  HORTENSIO. Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife To come to me forthwith.  [_Exit Biondello._]  PETRUCHIO. O, ho! entreat her! Nay, then she must needs come.  HORTENSIO. I am afraid, sir, Do what you can, yours will not be entreated.
Re-enter Biondello.  Now, where’s my wife?  BIONDELLO. She says you have some goodly jest in hand: She will not come; she bids you come to her.  PETRUCHIO. Worse and worse; she will not come! O vile, Intolerable, not to be endur’d! Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress, Say I command her come to me.  [_Exit Grumio._]  HORTENSIO. I know her answer.  PETRUCHIO. What?  HORTENSIO. She will not.  PETRUCHIO. The fouler fortune mine, and there an end.
Re-enter Katherina.  BAPTISTA. Now, by my holidame, here comes Katherina!  KATHERINA. What is your will sir, that you send for me?  PETRUCHIO. Where is your sister, and Hortensio’s wife?  KATHERINA. They sit conferring by the parlour fire.  PETRUCHIO. Go fetch them hither; if they deny to come, Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands. Away, I say, and bring them hither straight.  [_Exit Katherina._]  LUCENTIO. Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.  HORTENSIO. And so it is. I wonder what it bodes.  PETRUCHIO. Marry, peace it bodes, and love, and quiet life, An awful rule, and right supremacy; And, to be short, what not that’s sweet and happy.  BAPTISTA. Now fair befall thee, good Petruchio! The wager thou hast won; and I will add Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns; Another dowry to another daughter, For she is chang’d, as she had never been.  PETRUCHIO. Nay, I will win my wager better yet, And show more sign of her obedience, Her new-built virtue and obedience. See where she comes, and brings your froward wives As prisoners to her womanly persuasion.
Re-enter Katherina with Bianca and Widow.  Katherine, that cap of yours becomes you not: Off with that bauble, throw it underfoot.  [_Katherina pulls off her cap and throws it down._]  WIDOW. Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh Till I be brought to such a silly pass!  BIANCA. Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?  LUCENTIO. I would your duty were as foolish too; The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca, Hath cost me a hundred crowns since supper-time!  BIANCA. The more fool you for laying on my duty.  PETRUCHIO. Katherine, I charge thee, tell these headstrong women What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.  WIDOW. Come, come, you’re mocking; we will have no telling.  PETRUCHIO. Come on, I say; and first begin with her.  WIDOW. She shall not.  PETRUCHIO. I say she shall: and first begin with her.  KATHERINA. Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow, And dart not scornful glances from those eyes To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor: It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads, Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds, And in no sense is meet or amiable. A woman mov’d is like a fountain troubled, Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty; And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it. Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper, Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee, And for thy maintenance commits his body To painful labour both by sea and land, To watch the night in storms, the day in cold, Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe; And craves no other tribute at thy hands But love, fair looks, and true obedience; Too little payment for so great a debt. Such duty as the subject owes the prince, Even such a woman oweth to her husband; And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour, And not obedient to his honest will, What is she but a foul contending rebel And graceless traitor to her loving lord?— I am asham’d that women are so simple To offer war where they should kneel for peace, Or seek for rule, supremacy, and sway, When they are bound to serve, love, and obey. Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth, Unapt to toil and trouble in the world, But that our soft conditions and our hearts Should well agree with our external parts? Come, come, you froward and unable worms! My mind hath been as big as one of yours, My heart as great, my reason haply more, To bandy word for word and frown for frown; But now I see our lances are but straws, Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare, That seeming to be most which we indeed least are. Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot, And place your hands below your husband’s foot: In token of which duty, if he please, My hand is ready; may it do him ease.  PETRUCHIO. Why, there’s a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.  LUCENTIO. Well, go thy ways, old lad, for thou shalt ha’t.  VINCENTIO. ’Tis a good hearing when children are toward.  LUCENTIO. But a harsh hearing when women are froward.  PETRUCHIO. Come, Kate, we’ll to bed. We three are married, but you two are sped. ’Twas I won the wager, [_To Lucentio._] though you hit the white; And being a winner, God give you good night!  [_Exeunt Petruchio and Katherina._]  HORTENSIO. Now go thy ways; thou hast tam’d a curst shrew.  LUCENTIO. ’Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tam’d so.  [_Exeunt._]

  ACT I  SCENE I. On a ship at sea; a tempestuous noise of thunder and lightning heard.
_Come unto these yellow sands,     And then take hands: Curtsied when you have, and kiss’d     The wild waves whist. Foot it featly here and there,     And sweet sprites bear The burden. Hark, hark!_     Burden dispersedly. _Bow-wow. The watch dogs bark._     [Burden dispersedly.] _Bow-wow. Hark, hark! I hear The strain of strutting chanticleer     Cry cock-a-diddle-dow._  FERDINAND. Where should this music be? i’ th’ air or th’ earth? It sounds no more; and sure it waits upon Some god o’ th’ island. Sitting on a bank, Weeping again the King my father’s wrack, This music crept by me upon the waters, Allaying both their fury and my passion With its sweet air: thence I have follow’d it, Or it hath drawn me rather,—but ’tis gone. No, it begins again.  ARIEL. [_Sings._] _Full fathom five thy father lies.     Of his bones are coral made. Those are pearls that were his eyes.     Nothing of him that doth fade But doth suffer a sea-change Into something rich and strange. Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell:_     Burden: _Ding-dong. Hark! now I hear them: ding-dong, bell._  FERDINAND. The ditty does remember my drown’d father. This is no mortal business, nor no sound That the earth owes:—I hear it now above me.  PROSPERO. The fringed curtains of thine eye advance, And say what thou seest yond.  MIRANDA. What is’t? a spirit? Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir, It carries a brave form. But ’tis a spirit.  PROSPERO. No, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest Was in the wrack; and, but he’s something stain’d With grief,—that’s beauty’s canker,—thou mightst call him A goodly person: he hath lost his fellows And strays about to find ’em.  MIRANDA. I might call him A thing divine; for nothing natural I ever saw so noble.  PROSPERO. [_Aside._] It goes on, I see, As my soul prompts it. Spirit, fine spirit! I’ll free thee Within two days for this.  FERDINAND. Most sure, the goddess On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe, my prayer May know if you remain upon this island; And that you will some good instruction give How I may bear me here: my prime request, Which I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder! If you be maid or no?  MIRANDA. No wonder, sir; But certainly a maid.  FERDINAND. My language! Heavens! I am the best of them that speak this speech, Were I but where ’tis spoken.  PROSPERO. How! the best? What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee?  FERDINAND. A single thing, as I am now, that wonders To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me; And that he does I weep: myself am Naples, Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld The King my father wrack’d.  MIRANDA. Alack, for mercy!  FERDINAND. Yes, faith, and all his lords, the Duke of Milan, And his brave son being twain.  PROSPERO. [_Aside._] The Duke of Milan And his more braver daughter could control thee, If now ’twere fit to do’t. At the first sight They have changed eyes. Delicate Ariel, I’ll set thee free for this. [_To Ferdinand._] A word, good sir. I fear you have done yourself some wrong: a word.  MIRANDA. Why speaks my father so ungently? This Is the third man that e’er I saw; the first That e’er I sigh’d for. Pity move my father To be inclin’d my way!  FERDINAND. O! if a virgin, And your affection not gone forth, I’ll make you The Queen of Naples.  PROSPERO. Soft, sir; one word more. [_Aside._] They are both in either’s powers. But this swift business I must uneasy make, lest too light winning Make the prize light. [_To Ferdinand._] One word more. I charge thee That thou attend me. Thou dost here usurp The name thou ow’st not; and hast put thyself Upon this island as a spy, to win it From me, the lord on ’t.  FERDINAND. No, as I am a man.  MIRANDA. There’s nothing ill can dwell in such a temple: If the ill spirit have so fair a house, Good things will strive to dwell with ’t.  PROSPERO. [_To Ferdinand._] Follow me.— [_To Miranda._] Speak not you for him; he’s a traitor. [_To Ferdinand._] Come; I’ll manacle thy neck and feet together: Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be The fresh-brook mussels, wither’d roots, and husks Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow.  FERDINAND. No; I will resist such entertainment till Mine enemy has more power.   [_He draws, and is charmed from moving._]  MIRANDA. O dear father! Make not too rash a trial of him, for He’s gentle, and not fearful.  PROSPERO. What! I say, My foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor; Who mak’st a show, but dar’st not strike, thy conscience Is so possess’d with guilt: come from thy ward, For I can here disarm thee with this stick And make thy weapon drop.  MIRANDA. Beseech you, father!  PROSPERO. Hence! Hang not on my garments.  MIRANDA. Sir, have pity; I’ll be his surety.  PROSPERO. Silence! One word more Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What! An advocate for an impostor? hush! Thou think’st there is no more such shapes as he, Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench! To th’ most of men this is a Caliban, And they to him are angels.  MIRANDA. My affections Are then most humble; I have no ambition To see a goodlier man.  PROSPERO. [_To Ferdinand._] Come on; obey: Thy nerves are in their infancy again, And have no vigour in them.  FERDINAND. So they are: My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up. My father’s loss, the weakness which I feel, The wrack of all my friends, nor this man’s threats, To whom I am subdued, are but light to me, Might I but through my prison once a day Behold this maid: all corners else o’ th’ earth Let liberty make use of; space enough Have I in such a prison.  PROSPERO. [_Aside._] It works. [_To Ferdinand._] Come on. Thou hast done well, fine Ariel! [_To Ferdinand._] Follow me. [_To Ariel._] Hark what thou else shalt do me.  MIRANDA. Be of comfort; My father’s of a better nature, sir, Than he appears by speech: this is unwonted Which now came from him.  PROSPERO. Thou shalt be as free As mountain winds; but then exactly do All points of my command.  ARIEL. To th’ syllable.  PROSPERO. [_To Ferdinand._] Come, follow. Speak not for him.   [_Exeunt._]
  ACT II  SCENE I. Another part of the island.
  ACT III  SCENE I. Before Prospero’s cell.
  ACT IV  SCENE I. Before Prospero’s cell.
 Enter Prospero, Ferdinand and Miranda.  PROSPERO. If I have too austerely punish’d you, Your compensation makes amends: for I Have given you here a third of mine own life, Or that for which I live; who once again I tender to thy hand: all thy vexations Were but my trials of thy love, and thou Hast strangely stood the test: here, afore Heaven, I ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand, Do not smile at me that I boast her off, For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise, And make it halt behind her.  FERDINAND. I do believe it Against an oracle.  PROSPERO. Then, as my gift and thine own acquisition Worthily purchas’d, take my daughter: but If thou dost break her virgin knot before All sanctimonious ceremonies may With full and holy rite be minister’d, No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall To make this contract grow; but barren hate, Sour-ey’d disdain, and discord shall bestrew The union of your bed with weeds so loathly That you shall hate it both: therefore take heed, As Hymen’s lamps shall light you.  FERDINAND. As I hope For quiet days, fair issue, and long life, With such love as ’tis now, the murkiest den, The most opportune place, the strong’st suggestion Our worser genius can, shall never melt Mine honour into lust, to take away The edge of that day’s celebration, When I shall think, or Phoebus’ steeds are founder’d, Or Night kept chain’d below.  PROSPERO. Fairly spoke: Sit, then, and talk with her, she is thine own. What, Ariel! my industrious servant, Ariel!   Enter Ariel.  ARIEL. What would my potent master? here I am.  PROSPERO. Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service Did worthily perform; and I must use you In such another trick. Go bring the rabble, O’er whom I give thee power, here to this place. Incite them to quick motion; for I must Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple Some vanity of mine art: it is my promise, And they expect it from me.  ARIEL. Presently?  PROSPERO. Ay, with a twink.  ARIEL. Before you can say “Come” and “Go,” And breathe twice, and cry “so, so,” Each one, tripping on his toe, Will be here with mop and mow. Do you love me, master? no?  PROSPERO. Dearly, my delicate Ariel. Do not approach Till thou dost hear me call.  ARIEL. Well, I conceive.   [_Exit._]  PROSPERO. Look thou be true; do not give dalliance Too much the rein: the strongest oaths are straw To th’ fire i’ the blood: be more abstemious, Or else good night your vow!  FERDINAND. I warrant you, sir; The white cold virgin snow upon my heart Abates the ardour of my liver.  PROSPERO. Well. Now come, my Ariel! bring a corollary, Rather than want a spirit: appear, and pertly. No tongue! all eyes! be silent.   [_Soft music._]   A Masque. Enter Iris.  IRIS. Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats, and peas; Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep, And flat meads thatch’d with stover, them to keep; Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims, Which spongy April at thy hest betrims, To make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy broom groves, Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves, Being lass-lorn; thy pole-clipt vineyard; And thy sea-marge, sterile and rocky-hard, Where thou thyself dost air: the Queen o’ th’ sky, Whose wat’ry arch and messenger am I, Bids thee leave these; and with her sovereign grace, Here on this grass-plot, in this very place, To come and sport; her peacocks fly amain: Approach, rich Ceres, her to entertain.   Enter Ceres.  CERES. Hail, many-colour’d messenger, that ne’er Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter; Who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers Diffusest honey drops, refreshing showers; And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown My bosky acres and my unshrubb’d down, Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen Summon’d me hither to this short-grass’d green?  IRIS. A contract of true love to celebrate, And some donation freely to estate On the blest lovers.  CERES. Tell me, heavenly bow, If Venus or her son, as thou dost know, Do now attend the queen? Since they did plot The means that dusky Dis my daughter got, Her and her blind boy’s scandal’d company I have forsworn.  IRIS. Of her society Be not afraid. I met her deity Cutting the clouds towards Paphos, and her son Dove-drawn with her. Here thought they to have done Some wanton charm upon this man and maid, Whose vows are, that no bed-right shall be paid Till Hymen’s torch be lighted; but in vain. Mars’s hot minion is return’d again; Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows, Swears he will shoot no more, but play with sparrows, And be a boy right out.  CERES. Highest queen of State, Great Juno comes; I know her by her gait.   Enter Juno.  JUNO. How does my bounteous sister? Go with me To bless this twain, that they may prosperous be, And honour’d in their issue.   [_They sing._]  JUNO. _Honour, riches, marriage-blessing, Long continuance, and increasing, Hourly joys be still upon you! Juno sings her blessings on you._  CERES. _Earth’s increase, foison plenty, Barns and garners never empty; Vines with clust’ring bunches growing; Plants with goodly burden bowing; Spring come to you at the farthest In the very end of harvest! Scarcity and want shall shun you; Ceres’ blessing so is on you._  FERDINAND. This is a most majestic vision, and Harmonious charmingly. May I be bold To think these spirits?  PROSPERO. Spirits, which by mine art I have from their confines call’d to enact My present fancies.  FERDINAND. Let me live here ever. So rare a wonder’d father and a wise, Makes this place Paradise.   [_Juno and Ceres whisper, and send Iris on employment._]  PROSPERO. Sweet now, silence! Juno and Ceres whisper seriously, There’s something else to do: hush, and be mute, Or else our spell is marr’d.  IRIS. You nymphs, call’d Naiads, of the windring brooks, With your sedg’d crowns and ever-harmless looks, Leave your crisp channels, and on this green land Answer your summons; Juno does command. Come, temperate nymphs, and help to celebrate A contract of true love. Be not too late.   Enter certain Nymphs.  You sun-burn’d sicklemen, of August weary, Come hither from the furrow, and be merry: Make holiday: your rye-straw hats put on, And these fresh nymphs encounter every one In country footing.   Enter certain Reapers, properly habited: they join with the Nymphs in  a graceful dance; towards the end whereof Prospero starts suddenly,  and speaks; after which, to a strange, hollow, and confused noise,  they heavily vanish.  PROSPERO. [_Aside._] I had forgot that foul conspiracy Of the beast Caliban and his confederates Against my life: the minute of their plot Is almost come. [_To the Spirits._] Well done! avoid; no more!  FERDINAND. This is strange: your father’s in some passion That works him strongly.  MIRANDA. Never till this day Saw I him touch’d with anger so distemper’d.  PROSPERO. You do look, my son, in a mov’d sort, As if you were dismay’d: be cheerful, sir: Our revels now are ended. These our actors, As I foretold you, were all spirits and Are melted into air, into thin air: And, like the baseless fabric of this vision, The cloud-capp’d towers, the gorgeous palaces, The solemn temples, the great globe itself, Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve, And, like this insubstantial pageant faded, Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff As dreams are made on, and our little life Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vex’d: Bear with my weakness; my old brain is troubled. Be not disturb’d with my infirmity. If you be pleas’d, retire into my cell And there repose: a turn or two I’ll walk, To still my beating mind.  FERDINAND, MIRANDA. We wish your peace.   [_Exeunt._]  PROSPERO. Come, with a thought. I thank thee, Ariel. Come!   Enter Ariel.  ARIEL. Thy thoughts I cleave to. What’s thy pleasure?  PROSPERO. Spirit, We must prepare to meet with Caliban.  ARIEL. Ay, my commander. When I presented Ceres, I thought to have told thee of it; but I fear’d Lest I might anger thee.  PROSPERO. Say again, where didst thou leave these varlets?  ARIEL. I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking; So full of valour that they smote the air For breathing in their faces; beat the ground For kissing of their feet; yet always bending Towards their project. Then I beat my tabor; At which, like unback’d colts, they prick’d their ears, Advanc’d their eyelids, lifted up their noses As they smelt music: so I charm’d their ears, That calf-like they my lowing follow’d through Tooth’d briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss, and thorns, Which enter’d their frail shins: at last I left them I’ th’ filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell, There dancing up to th’ chins, that the foul lake O’erstunk their feet.  PROSPERO. This was well done, my bird. Thy shape invisible retain thou still: The trumpery in my house, go bring it hither For stale to catch these thieves.  ARIEL. I go, I go.   [_Exit._]  PROSPERO. A devil, a born devil, on whose nature Nurture can never stick; on whom my pains, Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost; And as with age his body uglier grows, So his mind cankers. I will plague them all, Even to roaring.   Re-enter Ariel, loaden with glistering apparel, &c.  Come, hang them on this line.   Prospero and Ariel remain invisible. Enter Caliban, Stephano and  Trinculo all wet.  CALIBAN. Pray you, tread softly, that the blind mole may not Hear a foot fall: we now are near his cell.  STEPHANO. Monster, your fairy, which you say is a harmless fairy, has done little better than played the Jack with us.  TRINCULO. Monster, I do smell all horse-piss; at which my nose is in great indignation.  STEPHANO. So is mine. Do you hear, monster? If I should take a displeasure against you, look you,—  TRINCULO. Thou wert but a lost monster.  CALIBAN. Good my lord, give me thy favour still. Be patient, for the prize I’ll bring thee to Shall hoodwink this mischance: therefore speak softly. All’s hush’d as midnight yet.  TRINCULO. Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool!  STEPHANO. There is not only disgrace and dishonour in that, monster, but an infinite loss.  TRINCULO. That’s more to me than my wetting: yet this is your harmless fairy, monster.  STEPHANO. I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o’er ears for my labour.  CALIBAN. Prithee, my King, be quiet. Seest thou here, This is the mouth o’ th’ cell: no noise, and enter. Do that good mischief which may make this island Thine own for ever, and I, thy Caliban, For aye thy foot-licker.  STEPHANO. Give me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody thoughts.  TRINCULO. O King Stephano! O peer! O worthy Stephano! Look what a wardrobe here is for thee!  CALIBAN. Let it alone, thou fool; it is but trash.  TRINCULO. O, ho, monster! we know what belongs to a frippery. O King Stephano!  STEPHANO. Put off that gown, Trinculo; by this hand, I’ll have that gown.  TRINCULO. Thy Grace shall have it.  CALIBAN. The dropsy drown this fool! What do you mean To dote thus on such luggage? Let’t alone, And do the murder first. If he awake, From toe to crown he’ll fill our skins with pinches, Make us strange stuff.  STEPHANO. Be you quiet, monster. Mistress line, is not this my jerkin? Now is the jerkin under the line: now, jerkin, you are like to lose your hair, and prove a bald jerkin.  TRINCULO. Do, do: we steal by line and level, an’t like your Grace.  STEPHANO. I thank thee for that jest. Here’s a garment for ’t: wit shall not go unrewarded while I am King of this country. “Steal by line and level,” is an excellent pass of pate. There’s another garment for ’t.  TRINCULO. Monster, come, put some lime upon your fingers, and away with the rest.  CALIBAN. I will have none on’t. We shall lose our time, And all be turn’d to barnacles, or to apes With foreheads villainous low.  STEPHANO. Monster, lay-to your fingers: help to bear this away where my hogshead of wine is, or I’ll turn you out of my kingdom. Go to, carry this.  TRINCULO. And this.  STEPHANO. Ay, and this.   A noise of hunters heard. Enter divers Spirits, in shape of dogs and  hounds, and hunt them about; Prospero and Ariel setting them on.  PROSPERO. Hey, Mountain, hey!  ARIEL. Silver! there it goes, Silver!  PROSPERO. Fury, Fury! There, Tyrant, there! hark, hark!   [_Caliban, Stephano and Trinculo are driven out._]  Go, charge my goblins that they grind their joints With dry convulsions; shorten up their sinews With aged cramps, and more pinch-spotted make them Than pard, or cat o’ mountain.  ARIEL. Hark, they roar.  PROSPERO. Let them be hunted soundly. At this hour Lies at my mercy all mine enemies. Shortly shall all my labours end, and thou Shalt have the air at freedom. For a little Follow, and do me service.   [_Exeunt._]
  ACT V  SCENE I. Before the cell of Prospero.
 Enter Prospero in his magic robes, and Ariel.  PROSPERO. Now does my project gather to a head: My charms crack not; my spirits obey, and time Goes upright with his carriage. How’s the day?  ARIEL. On the sixth hour; at which time, my lord, You said our work should cease.  PROSPERO. I did say so, When first I rais’d the tempest. Say, my spirit, How fares the King and ’s followers?  ARIEL. Confin’d together In the same fashion as you gave in charge, Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir, In the line grove which weather-fends your cell; They cannot budge till your release. The King, His brother, and yours, abide all three distracted, And the remainder mourning over them, Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly Him you term’d, sir, “the good old lord, Gonzalo”. His tears run down his beard, like winter’s drops From eaves of reeds; your charm so strongly works ’em, That if you now beheld them, your affections Would become tender.  PROSPERO. Dost thou think so, spirit?  ARIEL. Mine would, sir, were I human.  PROSPERO. And mine shall. Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling Of their afflictions, and shall not myself, One of their kind, that relish all as sharply Passion as they, be kindlier mov’d than thou art? Though with their high wrongs I am struck to th’ quick, Yet with my nobler reason ’gainst my fury Do I take part: the rarer action is In virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent, The sole drift of my purpose doth extend Not a frown further. Go release them, Ariel. My charms I’ll break, their senses I’ll restore, And they shall be themselves.  ARIEL. I’ll fetch them, sir.   [_Exit._]  PROSPERO. Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes, and groves; And ye that on the sands with printless foot Do chase the ebbing Neptune, and do fly him When he comes back; you demi-puppets that By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make, Whereof the ewe not bites; and you whose pastime Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid, Weak masters though ye be, I have bedimm’d The noontide sun, call’d forth the mutinous winds, And ’twixt the green sea and the azur’d vault Set roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder Have I given fire, and rifted Jove’s stout oak With his own bolt; the strong-bas’d promontory Have I made shake, and by the spurs pluck’d up The pine and cedar: graves at my command Have wak’d their sleepers, op’d, and let ’em forth By my so potent art. But this rough magic I here abjure; and, when I have requir’d Some heavenly music,—which even now I do,— To work mine end upon their senses that This airy charm is for, I’ll break my staff, Bury it certain fathoms in the earth, And deeper than did ever plummet sound I’ll drown my book.   [_Solemn music._]   Re-enter Ariel: after him, Alonso with a frantic gesture, attended by  Gonzalo, Sebastian and Antonio in like manner, attended by Adrian and  Francisco: they all enter the circle which Prospero had made, and  there stand charmed; which Prospero observing, speaks.  A solemn air, and the best comforter To an unsettled fancy, cure thy brains, Now useless, boil’d within thy skull! There stand, For you are spell-stopp’d. Holy Gonzalo, honourable man, Mine eyes, e’en sociable to the show of thine, Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace; And as the morning steals upon the night, Melting the darkness, so their rising senses Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo! My true preserver, and a loyal sir To him thou follow’st, I will pay thy graces Home, both in word and deed. Most cruelly Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter: Thy brother was a furtherer in the act. Thou art pinch’d for ’t now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood, You, brother mine, that entertain’d ambition, Expell’d remorse and nature, who, with Sebastian,— Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong, Would here have kill’d your King; I do forgive thee, Unnatural though thou art. Their understanding Begins to swell, and the approaching tide Will shortly fill the reasonable shores That now lie foul and muddy. Not one of them That yet looks on me, or would know me. Ariel, Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell.   [_Exit Ariel._]  I will discase me, and myself present As I was sometime Milan. Quickly, spirit; Thou shalt ere long be free.   Ariel re-enters, singing, and helps to attire Prospero.  ARIEL _Where the bee sucks, there suck I: In a cowslip’s bell I lie; There I couch when owls do cry. On the bat’s back I do fly After summer merrily. Merrily, merrily shall I live now Under the blossom that hangs on the bough._  PROSPERO. Why, that’s my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee; But yet thou shalt have freedom; so, so, so. To the King’s ship, invisible as thou art: There shalt thou find the mariners asleep Under the hatches; the master and the boatswain Being awake, enforce them to this place, And presently, I prithee.  ARIEL. I drink the air before me, and return Or ere your pulse twice beat.   [_Exit._]  GONZALO. All torment, trouble, wonder and amazement Inhabits here. Some heavenly power guide us Out of this fearful country!  PROSPERO. Behold, sir King, The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero. For more assurance that a living prince Does now speak to thee, I embrace thy body; And to thee and thy company I bid A hearty welcome.  ALONSO. Whe’er thou be’st he or no, Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me, As late I have been, I not know: thy pulse Beats, as of flesh and blood; and, since I saw thee, Th’ affliction of my mind amends, with which, I fear, a madness held me: this must crave, An if this be at all, a most strange story. Thy dukedom I resign, and do entreat Thou pardon me my wrongs. But how should Prospero Be living and be here?  PROSPERO. First, noble friend, Let me embrace thine age, whose honour cannot Be measur’d or confin’d.  GONZALO. Whether this be Or be not, I’ll not swear.  PROSPERO. You do yet taste Some subtleties o’ the isle, that will not let you Believe things certain. Welcome, my friends all. [_Aside to Sebastian and Antonio._] But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded, I here could pluck his highness’ frown upon you, And justify you traitors: at this time I will tell no tales.  SEBASTIAN. [_Aside._] The devil speaks in him.  PROSPERO. No. For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive Thy rankest fault, all of them; and require My dukedom of thee, which perforce I know Thou must restore.  ALONSO. If thou beest Prospero, Give us particulars of thy preservation; How thou hast met us here, whom three hours since Were wrack’d upon this shore; where I have lost,— How sharp the point of this remembrance is!— My dear son Ferdinand.  PROSPERO. I am woe for ’t, sir.  ALONSO. Irreparable is the loss, and patience Says it is past her cure.  PROSPERO. I rather think You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace, For the like loss I have her sovereign aid, And rest myself content.  ALONSO. You the like loss!  PROSPERO. As great to me, as late; and, supportable To make the dear loss, have I means much weaker Than you may call to comfort you, for I Have lost my daughter.  ALONSO. A daughter? O heavens, that they were living both in Naples, The King and Queen there! That they were, I wish Myself were mudded in that oozy bed Where my son lies. When did you lose your daughter?  PROSPERO. In this last tempest. I perceive, these lords At this encounter do so much admire That they devour their reason, and scarce think Their eyes do offices of truth, their words Are natural breath; but, howsoe’er you have Been justled from your senses, know for certain That I am Prospero, and that very duke Which was thrust forth of Milan; who most strangely Upon this shore, where you were wrack’d, was landed To be the lord on’t. No more yet of this; For ’tis a chronicle of day by day, Not a relation for a breakfast nor Befitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir. This cell’s my court: here have I few attendants, And subjects none abroad: pray you, look in. My dukedom since you have given me again, I will requite you with as good a thing; At least bring forth a wonder, to content ye As much as me my dukedom.  Here Prospero discovers Ferdinand and Miranda playing at chess.  MIRANDA. Sweet lord, you play me false.  FERDINAND. No, my dearest love, I would not for the world.  MIRANDA. Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle, And I would call it fair play.  ALONSO. If this prove A vision of the island, one dear son Shall I twice lose.  SEBASTIAN. A most high miracle!  FERDINAND. Though the seas threaten, they are merciful. I have curs’d them without cause.   [_Kneels to Alonso._]  ALONSO. Now all the blessings Of a glad father compass thee about! Arise, and say how thou cam’st here.  MIRANDA. O, wonder! How many goodly creatures are there here! How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world That has such people in ’t!  PROSPERO. ’Tis new to thee.  ALONSO. What is this maid, with whom thou wast at play? Your eld’st acquaintance cannot be three hours: Is she the goddess that hath sever’d us, And brought us thus together?  FERDINAND. Sir, she is mortal; But by immortal Providence she’s mine. I chose her when I could not ask my father For his advice, nor thought I had one. She Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan, Of whom so often I have heard renown, But never saw before; of whom I have Receiv’d a second life; and second father This lady makes him to me.  ALONSO. I am hers: But, O, how oddly will it sound that I Must ask my child forgiveness!  PROSPERO. There, sir, stop: Let us not burden our remembrances with A heaviness that’s gone.  GONZALO. I have inly wept, Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you gods, And on this couple drop a blessed crown; For it is you that have chalk’d forth the way Which brought us hither.  ALONSO. I say, Amen, Gonzalo!  GONZALO. Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue Should become Kings of Naples? O, rejoice Beyond a common joy, and set it down With gold on lasting pillars: in one voyage Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis, And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife Where he himself was lost; Prospero his dukedom In a poor isle; and all of us ourselves, When no man was his own.  ALONSO. [_To Ferdinand and Miranda._] Give me your hands: Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart That doth not wish you joy!  GONZALO. Be it so. Amen!   Re-enter Ariel with the Master and Boatswain amazedly following.  O look, sir, look, sir! Here are more of us. I prophesied, if a gallows were on land, This fellow could not drown. Now, blasphemy, That swear’st grace o’erboard, not an oath on shore? Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?  BOATSWAIN. The best news is that we have safely found Our King and company. The next, our ship,— Which but three glasses since, we gave out split, Is tight and yare, and bravely rigg’d as when We first put out to sea.  ARIEL. [_Aside to Prospero._] Sir, all this service Have I done since I went.  PROSPERO. [_Aside to Ariel._] My tricksy spirit!  ALONSO. These are not natural events; they strengthen From strange to stranger. Say, how came you hither?  BOATSWAIN. If I did think, sir, I were well awake, I’d strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep, And,—how, we know not,—all clapp’d under hatches, Where, but even now, with strange and several noises Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains, And mo diversity of sounds, all horrible, We were awak’d; straightway, at liberty: Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld Our royal, good, and gallant ship; our master Cap’ring to eye her. On a trice, so please you, Even in a dream, were we divided from them, And were brought moping hither.  ARIEL. [_Aside to Prospero._] Was’t well done?  PROSPERO. [_Aside to Ariel._] Bravely, my diligence. Thou shalt be free.  ALONSO. This is as strange a maze as e’er men trod; And there is in this business more than nature Was ever conduct of: some oracle Must rectify our knowledge.  PROSPERO. Sir, my liege, Do not infest your mind with beating on The strangeness of this business. At pick’d leisure, Which shall be shortly, single I’ll resolve you, Which to you shall seem probable, of every These happen’d accidents; till when, be cheerful And think of each thing well. [_Aside to Ariel._] Come hither, spirit; Set Caliban and his companions free; Untie the spell.   [_Exit Ariel._]   How fares my gracious sir? There are yet missing of your company Some few odd lads that you remember not.   Re-enter Ariel driving in Caliban, Stephano and Trinculo in their  stolen apparel.  STEPHANO. Every man shift for all the rest, and let no man take care for himself, for all is but fortune.—Coragio! bully-monster, coragio!  TRINCULO. If these be true spies which I wear in my head, here’s a goodly sight.  CALIBAN. O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed. How fine my master is! I am afraid He will chastise me.  SEBASTIAN. Ha, ha! What things are these, my lord Antonio? Will money buy them?  ANTONIO. Very like; one of them Is a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable.  PROSPERO. Mark but the badges of these men, my lords, Then say if they be true. This mis-shapen knave, His mother was a witch; and one so strong That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs, And deal in her command without her power. These three have robb’d me; and this demi-devil, For he’s a bastard one, had plotted with them To take my life. Two of these fellows you Must know and own; this thing of darkness I Acknowledge mine.  CALIBAN. I shall be pinch’d to death.  ALONSO. Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?  SEBASTIAN. He is drunk now: where had he wine?  ALONSO. And Trinculo is reeling-ripe: where should they Find this grand liquor that hath gilded ’em? How cam’st thou in this pickle?  TRINCULO. I have been in such a pickle since I saw you last that, I fear me, will never out of my bones. I shall not fear fly-blowing.  SEBASTIAN. Why, how now, Stephano!  STEPHANO. O! touch me not. I am not Stephano, but a cramp.  PROSPERO. You’d be King o’ the isle, sirrah?  STEPHANO. I should have been a sore one, then.  ALONSO. This is as strange a thing as e’er I look’d on.   [_Pointing to Caliban._]  PROSPERO. He is as disproportioned in his manners As in his shape. Go, sirrah, to my cell; Take with you your companions. As you look To have my pardon, trim it handsomely.  CALIBAN. Ay, that I will; and I’ll be wise hereafter, And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass Was I, to take this drunkard for a god, And worship this dull fool!  PROSPERO. Go to; away!  ALONSO. Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.  SEBASTIAN. Or stole it, rather.   [_Exeunt Caliban, Stephano and Trinculo._]  PROSPERO. Sir, I invite your Highness and your train To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest For this one night; which, part of it, I’ll waste With such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it Go quick away: the story of my life And the particular accidents gone by Since I came to this isle: and in the morn I’ll bring you to your ship, and so to Naples, Where I have hope to see the nuptial Of these our dear-belov’d solemnized; And thence retire me to my Milan, where Every third thought shall be my grave.  ALONSO. I long To hear the story of your life, which must Take the ear strangely.  PROSPERO. I’ll deliver all; And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales, And sail so expeditious that shall catch Your royal fleet far off. [_Aside to Ariel._] My Ariel, chick, That is thy charge: then to the elements Be free, and fare thou well! Please you, draw near.   [_Exeunt._]  EPILOGUE  PROSPERO. Now my charms are all o’erthrown, And what strength I have’s mine own, Which is most faint. Now ’tis true, I must be here confin’d by you, Or sent to Naples. Let me not, Since I have my dukedom got, And pardon’d the deceiver, dwell In this bare island by your spell, But release me from my bands With the help of your good hands. Gentle breath of yours my sails Must fill, or else my project fails, Which was to please. Now I want Spirits to enforce, art to enchant; And my ending is despair, Unless I be reliev’d by prayer, Which pierces so that it assaults Mercy itself, and frees all faults.     As you from crimes would pardon’d be,     Let your indulgence set me free.   [_Exit._]

Enter Poet, Painter, Jeweller and Merchant at several doors.  POET. Good day, sir.  PAINTER. I am glad you’re well.  POET. I have not seen you long. How goes the world?  PAINTER. It wears, sir, as it grows.  POET. Ay, that’s well known. But what particular rarity? What strange, Which manifold record not matches? See, Magic of bounty, all these spirits thy power Hath conjured to attend! I know the merchant.  PAINTER. I know them both. Th’ other’s a jeweller.  MERCHANT. O, ’tis a worthy lord!  JEWELLER. Nay, that’s most fixed.  MERCHANT. A most incomparable man, breathed, as it were, To an untirable and continuate goodness. He passes.  JEWELLER. I have a jewel here—  MERCHANT. O, pray let’s see’t. For the Lord Timon, sir?  JEWELLER. If he will touch the estimate. But for that—  POET. When we for recompense have praised the vile, It stains the glory in that happy verse Which aptly sings the good.  MERCHANT. [_Looking at the jewel_.] ’Tis a good form.  JEWELLER. And rich. Here is a water, look ye.  PAINTER. You are rapt, sir, in some work, some dedication To the great lord.  POET. A thing slipped idly from me. Our poesy is as a gum which oozes From whence ’tis nourished. The fire i’ th’ flint Shows not till it be struck; our gentle flame Provokes itself and, like the current, flies Each bound it chases. What have you there?  PAINTER. A picture, sir. When comes your book forth?  POET. Upon the heels of my presentment, sir. Let’s see your piece.  PAINTER. ’Tis a good piece.  POET. So ’tis. This comes off well and excellent.  PAINTER. Indifferent.  POET. Admirable! How this grace Speaks his own standing! What a mental power This eye shoots forth! How big imagination Moves in this lip! To th’ dumbness of the gesture One might interpret.  PAINTER. It is a pretty mocking of the life. Here is a touch. Is’t good?  POET. I’ll say of it, It tutors nature. Artificial strife Lives in these touches livelier than life.  Enter certain Senators, who pass over the stage.  PAINTER. How this lord is followed!  POET. The senators of Athens, happy men!  PAINTER. Look, more!  POET. You see this confluence, this great flood of visitors. I have in this rough work shaped out a man Whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug With amplest entertainment. My free drift Halts not particularly, but moves itself In a wide sea of wax. No levelled malice Infects one comma in the course I hold, But flies an eagle flight, bold and forth on, Leaving no tract behind.  PAINTER. How shall I understand you?  POET. I will unbolt to you. You see how all conditions, how all minds, As well of glib and slipp’ry creatures as Of grave and austere quality, tender down Their services to Lord Timon. His large fortune, Upon his good and gracious nature hanging, Subdues and properties to his love and tendance All sorts of hearts; yea, from the glass-faced flatterer To Apemantus, that few things loves better Than to abhor himself; even he drops down The knee before him and returns in peace Most rich in Timon’s nod.  PAINTER. I saw them speak together.  POET. Sir, I have upon a high and pleasant hill Feigned Fortune to be throned. The base o’ th’ mount Is ranked with all deserts, all kind of natures That labour on the bosom of this sphere To propagate their states. Amongst them all Whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fixed, One do I personate of Lord Timon’s frame, Whom Fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her, Whose present grace to present slaves and servants Translates his rivals.  PAINTER. ’Tis conceived to scope. This throne, this Fortune, and this hill, methinks, With one man beckoned from the rest below, Bowing his head against the steepy mount To climb his happiness, would be well expressed In our condition.  POET. Nay, sir, but hear me on. All those which were his fellows but of late, Some better than his value, on the moment Follow his strides, his lobbies fill with tendance, Rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear, Make sacred even his stirrup, and through him Drink the free air.  PAINTER. Ay, marry, what of these?  POET. When Fortune in her shift and change of mood Spurns down her late beloved, all his dependants, Which laboured after him to the mountain’s top Even on their knees and hands, let him slip down, Not one accompanying his declining foot.  PAINTER. ’Tis common. A thousand moral paintings I can show That shall demonstrate these quick blows of Fortune’s More pregnantly than words. Yet you do well To show Lord Timon that mean eyes have seen The foot above the head.  Trumpets sound. Enter Lord Timon, addressing himself courteously to every suitor. He is accompanied by a Messenger; Lucilius and other servants follow.  TIMON. Imprisoned is he, say you?  MESSENGER. Ay, my good lord. Five talents is his debt, His means most short, his creditors most strait. Your honourable letter he desires To those have shut him up, which, failing, Periods his comfort.  TIMON. Noble Ventidius. Well, I am not of that feather to shake off My friend when he must need me. I do know him A gentleman that well deserves a help, Which he shall have. I’ll pay the debt and free him.  MESSENGER. Your lordship ever binds him.  TIMON. Commend me to him, I will send his ransom; And, being enfranchised, bid him come to me. ’Tis not enough to help the feeble up, But to support him after. Fare you well.  MESSENGER. All happiness to your honour.  [_Exit._]  Enter an Old Athenian.  OLD ATHENIAN. Lord Timon, hear me speak.  TIMON. Freely, good father.  OLD ATHENIAN. Thou hast a servant named Lucilius.  TIMON. I have so. What of him?  OLD ATHENIAN. Most noble Timon, call the man before thee.  TIMON. Attends he here or no? Lucilius!  LUCILIUS. Here, at your lordship’s service.  OLD ATHENIAN. This fellow here, Lord Timon, this thy creature, By night frequents my house. I am a man That from my first have been inclined to thrift, And my estate deserves an heir more raised Than one which holds a trencher.  TIMON. Well, what further?  OLD ATHENIAN. One only daughter have I, no kin else, On whom I may confer what I have got. The maid is fair, o’ th’ youngest for a bride, And I have bred her at my dearest cost In qualities of the best. This man of thine Attempts her love. I prithee, noble lord, Join with me to forbid him her resort; Myself have spoke in vain.  TIMON. The man is honest.  OLD ATHENIAN. Therefore he will be, Timon. His honesty rewards him in itself; It must not bear my daughter.  TIMON. Does she love him?  OLD ATHENIAN. She is young and apt. Our own precedent passions do instruct us What levity’s in youth.  TIMON. [_To Lucilius_.] Love you the maid?  LUCILIUS. Ay, my good lord, and she accepts of it.  OLD ATHENIAN. If in her marriage my consent be missing, I call the gods to witness, I will choose Mine heir from forth the beggars of the world And dispossess her all.  TIMON. How shall she be endowed, If she be mated with an equal husband?  OLD ATHENIAN. Three talents on the present; in future, all.  TIMON. This gentleman of mine hath served me long. To build his fortune I will strain a little, For ’tis a bond in men. Give him thy daughter. What you bestow, in him I’ll counterpoise, And make him weigh with her.  OLD ATHENIAN. Most noble lord, Pawn me to this your honour, she is his.  TIMON. My hand to thee; mine honour on my promise.  LUCILIUS. Humbly I thank your lordship. Never may That state or fortune fall into my keeping Which is not owed to you.  [_Exeunt Lucilius and Old Athenian._]  POET. [_Presenting his poem_.] Vouchsafe my labour, and long live your lordship.  TIMON. I thank you, you shall hear from me anon. Go not away.—What have you there, my friend?  PAINTER. A piece of painting, which I do beseech Your lordship to accept.  TIMON. Painting is welcome. The painting is almost the natural man, For since dishonour traffics with man’s nature, He is but outside; these pencilled figures are Even such as they give out. I like your work, And you shall find I like it. Wait attendance Till you hear further from me.  PAINTER. The gods preserve you.  TIMON. Well fare you, gentleman. Give me your hand. We must needs dine together. Sir, your jewel Hath suffered under praise.  JEWELLER. What, my lord, dispraise?  TIMON. A mere satiety of commendations. If I should pay you for ’t as ’tis extolled, It would unclew me quite.  JEWELLER. My lord, ’tis rated As those which sell would give. But you well know Things of like value, differing in the owners, Are prized by their masters. Believe’t, dear lord, You mend the jewel by the wearing it.  TIMON. Well mocked.  MERCHANT. No, my good lord, he speaks the common tongue, Which all men speak with him.  Enter Apemantus.  TIMON. Look who comes here. Will you be chid?  JEWELLER. We’ll bear, with your lordship.  MERCHANT. He’ll spare none.  TIMON. Good morrow to thee, gentle Apemantus.  APEMANTUS. Till I be gentle, stay thou for thy good morrow— When thou art Timon’s dog, and these knaves honest.  TIMON. Why dost thou call them knaves? Thou know’st them not.  APEMANTUS. Are they not Athenians?  TIMON. Yes.  APEMANTUS. Then I repent not.  JEWELLER. You know me, Apemantus?  APEMANTUS. Thou know’st I do, I called thee by thy name.  TIMON. Thou art proud, Apemantus.  APEMANTUS. Of nothing so much as that I am not like Timon.  TIMON. Whither art going?  APEMANTUS. To knock out an honest Athenian’s brains.  TIMON. That’s a deed thou’lt die for.  APEMANTUS. Right, if doing nothing be death by th’ law.  TIMON. How lik’st thou this picture, Apemantus?  APEMANTUS. The best, for the innocence.  TIMON. Wrought he not well that painted it?  APEMANTUS. He wrought better that made the painter, and yet he’s but a filthy piece of work.  PAINTER. You’re a dog.  APEMANTUS. Thy mother’s of my generation. What’s she, if I be a dog?  TIMON. Wilt dine with me, Apemantus?  APEMANTUS. No, I eat not lords.  TIMON. An thou shouldst, thou’dst anger ladies.  APEMANTUS. O, they eat lords. So they come by great bellies.  TIMON. That’s a lascivious apprehension.  APEMANTUS. So thou apprehend’st it, take it for thy labour.  TIMON. How dost thou like this jewel, Apemantus?  APEMANTUS. Not so well as plain-dealing, which will not cost a man a doit.  TIMON. What dost thou think ’tis worth?  APEMANTUS. Not worth my thinking. How now, poet?  POET. How now, philosopher?  APEMANTUS. Thou liest.  POET. Art not one?  APEMANTUS. Yes.  POET. Then I lie not.  APEMANTUS. Art not a poet?  POET. Yes.  APEMANTUS. Then thou liest. Look in thy last work, where thou hast feigned him a worthy fellow.  POET. That’s not feigned, he is so.  APEMANTUS. Yes, he is worthy of thee, and to pay thee for thy labour. He that loves to be flattered is worthy o’ th’ flatterer. Heavens, that I were a lord!  TIMON. What wouldst do then, Apemantus?  APEMANTUS. E’en as Apemantus does now, hate a lord with my heart.  TIMON. What, thyself?  APEMANTUS. Ay.  TIMON. Wherefore?  APEMANTUS. That I had no angry wit to be a lord. Art not thou a merchant?  MERCHANT. Ay, Apemantus.  APEMANTUS. Traffic confound thee, if the gods will not.  MERCHANT. If traffic do it, the gods do it.  APEMANTUS. Traffic’s thy god, and thy god confound thee!  Trumpet sounds. Enter a Messenger.  TIMON. What trumpet’s that?  MESSENGER. ’Tis Alcibiades, and some twenty horse, All of companionship.  TIMON. Pray entertain them, give them guide to us.  [_Exeunt some Attendants._]  You must needs dine with me. Go not you hence Till I have thanked you; when dinner’s done, Show me this piece. I am joyful of your sights.  Enter Alcibiades with his company.  Most welcome, sir.  [_They bow to each other._]  APEMANTUS. [_Aside_.] So, so, there! Aches contract and starve your supple joints! That there should be small love amongst these sweet knaves, And all this courtesy! The strain of man’s bred out Into baboon and monkey.  ALCIBIADES. Sir, you have saved my longing, and I feed Most hungerly on your sight.  TIMON. Right welcome, sir! Ere we depart we’ll share a bounteous time In different pleasures. Pray you, let us in.  [_Exeunt all but Apemantus._]  Enter two Lords.  FIRST LORD. What time o’ day is’t, Apemantus?  APEMANTUS. Time to be honest.  FIRST LORD. That time serves still.  APEMANTUS. The more accursed thou, that still omitt’st it.  SECOND LORD. Thou art going to Lord Timon’s feast?  APEMANTUS. Ay, to see meat fill knaves and wine heat fools.  SECOND LORD. Fare thee well, fare thee well.  APEMANTUS. Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice.  SECOND LORD. Why, Apemantus?  APEMANTUS. Shouldst have kept one to thyself, for I mean to give thee none.  FIRST LORD. Hang thyself!  APEMANTUS. No, I will do nothing at thy bidding. Make thy requests to thy friend.  SECOND LORD. Away, unpeaceable dog, or I’ll spurn thee hence.  APEMANTUS. I will fly, like a dog, the heels o’ th’ ass.  [_Exit._]  FIRST LORD. He’s opposite to humanity. Come, shall we in And taste Lord Timon’s bounty? He outgoes The very heart of kindness.  SECOND LORD. He pours it out; Plutus, the god of gold, Is but his steward. No meed but he repays Sevenfold above itself, no gift to him But breeds the giver a return exceeding All use of quittance.  FIRST LORD. The noblest mind he carries That ever governed man.  SECOND LORD. Long may he live in fortunes. Shall we in?  FIRST LORD. I’ll keep you company.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. The Same. A room of state in Timon’s house  Hautboys playing loud music. A great banquet served in, Flavius and others attending; and then enter Lord Timon,  the Senators, the Athenian Lords, Alcibiades, and Ventidius, which Timon redeemded from prison. Then comes, dropping after all, Apemantus, discontentedly, like himself.  VENTIDIUS. Most honoured Timon, It hath pleased the gods to remember my father’s age And call him to long peace. He is gone happy and has left me rich. Then, as in grateful virtue I am bound To your free heart, I do return those talents, Doubled with thanks and service, from whose help I derived liberty.  TIMON. O, by no means, Honest Ventidius. You mistake my love. I gave it freely ever, and there’s none Can truly say he gives if he receives. If our betters play at that game, we must not dare To imitate them; faults that are rich are fair.  VENTIDIUS. A noble spirit!  TIMON. Nay, my lords, ceremony was but devised at first To set a gloss on faint deeds, hollow welcomes, Recanting goodness, sorry ere ’tis shown; But where there is true friendship there needs none. Pray, sit, more welcome are ye to my fortunes Than my fortunes to me.  [_They sit._]  FIRST LORD. My lord, we always have confessed it.  APEMANTUS. Ho, ho, confessed it? Hanged it, have you not?  TIMON. O Apemantus, you are welcome.  APEMANTUS. No, You shall not make me welcome. I come to have thee thrust me out of doors.  TIMON. Fie, thou’rt a churl, ye’ve got a humour there Does not become a man; ’tis much to blame. They say, my lords, _ira furor brevis est_, But yond man is ever angry. Go, let him have a table by himself, For he does neither affect company, Nor is he fit for it indeed.  APEMANTUS. Let me stay at thine apperil, Timon. I come to observe; I give thee warning on’t.  TIMON. I take no heed of thee. Thou’rt an Athenian, therefore, welcome. I myself would have no power; prithee; let my meat make thee silent.  APEMANTUS. I scorn thy meat, ’twould choke me, for I should ne’er flatter thee. O you gods, what a number of men eats Timon, and he sees ’em not! It grieves me to see so many dip their meat in one man’s blood; and all the madness is, he cheers them up too. I wonder men dare trust themselves with men. Methinks they should invite them without knives. Good for their meat, and safer for their lives. There’s much example for ’t. The fellow that sits next him, now parts bread with him, pledges the breath of him in a divided draft, is the readiest man to kill him. ’T has been proved. If I were a huge man, I should fear to drink at meals, Lest they should spy my wind-pipe’s dangerous notes. Great men should drink with harness on their throats.  TIMON. My lord, in heart, and let the health go round.  SECOND LORD. Let it flow this way, my good lord.  APEMANTUS. Flow this way? A brave fellow! He keeps his tides well. Those healths will make thee and thy state look ill, Timon. Here’s that which is too weak to be a sinner, Honest water, which ne’er left man i’ the mire. This and my food are equals, there’s no odds. Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods.  _Apemantus’ grace_
    Immortal gods, I crave no pelf,     I pray for no man but myself.     Grant I may never prove so fond     To trust man on his oath or bond,     Or a harlot for her weeping,     Or a dog that seems a-sleeping,     Or a keeper with my freedom,     Or my friends if I should need ’em.         Amen. So fall to’t.         Rich men sin, and I eat root.  [_He eats and drinks._]  Much good dich thy good heart, Apemantus!  TIMON. Captain Alcibiades, your heart’s in the field now.  ALCIBIADES. My heart is ever at your service, my lord.  TIMON. You had rather be at a breakfast of enemies than a dinner of friends.  ALCIBIADES. So they were bleeding new, my lord, there’s no meat like ’em. I could wish my best friend at such a feast.  APEMANTUS. Would all those flatterers were thine enemies then, that then thou mightst kill ’em, and bid me to ’em.  FIRST LORD. Might we but have that happiness, my lord, that you would once use our hearts, whereby we might express some part of our zeals, we should think ourselves for ever perfect.  TIMON. O, no doubt, my good friends, but the gods themselves have provided that I shall have much help from you. How had you been my friends else? Why have you that charitable title from thousands, did not you chiefly belong to my heart? I have told more of you to myself than you can with modesty speak in your own behalf. And thus far I confirm you. O you gods, think I, what need we have any friends if we should ne’er have need of ’em? They were the most needless creatures living, should we ne’er have use for ’em, and would most resemble sweet instruments hung up in cases, that keep their sounds to themselves. Why, I have often wished myself poorer that I might come nearer to you. We are born to do benefits, and what better or properer can we call our own than the riches of our friends? O, what a precious comfort ’tis to have so many, like brothers, commanding one another’s fortunes. O joy’s e’en made away ere’t can be born! Mine eyes cannot hold out water, methinks. To forget their faults, I drink to you.  APEMANTUS. Thou weep’st to make them drink, Timon.  SECOND LORD. Joy had the like conception in our eyes And, at that instant like a babe sprung up.  APEMANTUS. Ho, ho! I laugh to think that babe a bastard.  THIRD LORD. I promise you, my lord, you moved me much.  APEMANTUS. Much!  [_A tucket sounds._]  TIMON. What means that trump?  Enter a Servant.  How now?  SERVANT. Please you, my lord, there are certain ladies most desirous of admittance.  TIMON. Ladies? What are their wills?  SERVANT. There comes with them a forerunner, my lord, which bears that office, to signify their pleasures.  TIMON. I pray, let them be admitted.  [_Exit Servant._]  Enter Cupid.  CUPID. Hail to thee, worthy Timon, and to all That of his bounties taste! The five best senses Acknowledge thee their patron and come freely To gratulate thy plenteous bosom. There Taste, touch, all, pleased from thy table rise; They only now come but to feast thine eyes.  TIMON. They’re welcome all, let ’em have kind admittance. Music, make their welcome!  FIRST LORD. You see, my lord, how ample you’re beloved.  Music. Enter a masque of Ladies as Amazons, with lutes in their hands, dancing and playing.  APEMANTUS. Hoy-day! What a sweep of vanity comes this way. They dance? They are madwomen. Like madness is the glory of this life, As this pomp shows to a little oil and root. We make ourselves fools to disport ourselves, And spend our flatteries to drink those men Upon whose age we void it up again With poisonous spite and envy. Who lives that’s not depraved or depraves? Who dies that bears not one spurn to their graves Of their friend’s gift? I should fear those that dance before me now Would one day stamp upon me. ’T has been done. Men shut their doors against a setting sun.  [_The Lords rise from table, with much adoring of Timon, and to show their loves each singles out an Amazon, and all dance, men with women, a lofty strain or two to the hautboys, and cease._]  TIMON. You have done our pleasures much grace, fair ladies, Set a fair fashion on our entertainment, Which was not half so beautiful and kind. You have added worth unto ’t and lustre, And entertained me with mine own device. I am to thank you for ’t.  FIRST LADY. My lord, you take us even at the best.  APEMANTUS. Faith, for the worst is filthy and would not hold taking, I doubt me.  TIMON. Ladies, there is an idle banquet attends you, Please you to dispose yourselves.  ALL LADIES. Most thankfully, my lord.  [_Exeunt Cupid and Ladies._]  TIMON. Flavius!  FLAVIUS. My lord?  TIMON. The little casket bring me hither.  FLAVIUS. Yes, my lord. [_Aside_.] More jewels yet? There is no crossing him in ’s humour; Else I should tell him well, i’ faith, I should, When all’s spent, he’d be crossed then, an he could. ’Tis pity bounty had not eyes behind, That man might ne’er be wretched for his mind.  [_Exit._]  FIRST LORD. Where be our men?  SERVANT. Here, my lord, in readiness.  SECOND LORD. Our horses!  Enter Flavius with the casket.  TIMON. O, my friends, I have one word To say to you. Look you, my good lord, I must entreat you, honour me so much As to advance this jewel. Accept it and wear it, Kind my lord.  FIRST LORD. I am so far already in your gifts—  ALL. So are we all.  Enter a Servant.  SERVANT. My lord, there are certain nobles of the Senate Newly alighted and come to visit you.  TIMON. They are fairly welcome.  [_Exit Servant._]  FLAVIUS. I beseech your honour, Vouchsafe me a word. It does concern you near.  TIMON. Near? Why then, another time I’ll hear thee. I prithee let’s be provided to show them entertainment.  FLAVIUS. [_Aside_.] I scarce know how.  Enter another Servant.  SECOND SERVANT. May it please your honour, Lord Lucius, Out of his free love, hath presented to you Four milk-white horses, trapped in silver.  TIMON. I shall accept them fairly; let the presents Be worthily entertained.  [_Exit Servant._]  Enter a third Servant.  How now? What news?  THIRD SERVANT. Please you, my lord, that honourable gentleman, Lord Lucullus, entreats your company tomorrow to hunt with him and has sent your honour two brace of greyhounds.  TIMON. I’ll hunt with him; and let them be received, Not without fair reward.  [_Exit Servant._]  FLAVIUS. [_Aside_.] What will this come to? He commands us to provide, and give great gifts, And all out of an empty coffer; Nor will he know his purse or yield me this: To show him what a beggar his heart is, Being of no power to make his wishes good. His promises fly so beyond his state That what he speaks is all in debt; he owes For every word. He is so kind that he now Pays interest for ’t; his land’s put to their books. Well, would I were gently put out of office Before I were forced out. Happier is he that has no friend to feed Than such that do e’en enemies exceed. I bleed inwardly for my lord.  [_Exit._]  TIMON. You do yourselves much wrong, You bate too much of your own merits. Here, my lord, a trifle of our love.  SECOND LORD. With more than common thanks I will receive it.  THIRD LORD. O, he’s the very soul of bounty!  TIMON. And now I remember, my lord, you gave good words the other day of a bay courser I rode on. ’Tis yours because you liked it.  THIRD LORD. O, I beseech you, pardon me, my lord, in that.  TIMON. You may take my word, my lord. I know no man Can justly praise but what he does affect. I weigh my friend’s affection with mine own. I’ll tell you true, I’ll call to you.  ALL LORDS. O, none so welcome!  TIMON. I take all and your several visitations So kind to heart, ’tis not enough to give; Methinks I could deal kingdoms to my friends, And ne’er be weary. Alcibiades, Thou art a soldier, therefore seldom rich. It comes in charity to thee, for all thy living Is ’mongst the dead, and all the lands thou hast Lie in a pitched field.  ALCIBIADES. Ay, defiled land, my lord.  FIRST LORD. We are so virtuously bound—  TIMON. And so am I to you.  SECOND LORD. So infinitely endeared—  TIMON. All to you. Lights, more lights!  FIRST LORD. The best of happiness, honour, and fortunes keep with you, Lord Timon.  TIMON. Ready for his friends.  [_Exeunt all but Apemantus and Timon._]  APEMANTUS. What a coil’s here! Serving of becks and jutting out of bums! I doubt whether their legs be worth the sums That are given for ’em. Friendship’s full of dregs. Methinks false hearts should never have sound legs. Thus honest fools lay out their wealth on curtsies.  TIMON. Now, Apemantus, if thou wert not sullen, I would be good to thee.  APEMANTUS. No, I’ll nothing, for if I should be bribed too, there would be none left to rail upon thee, and then thou wouldst sin the faster. Thou giv’st so long, Timon, I fear me thou wilt give away thyself in paper shortly. What needs these feasts, pomps, and vainglories?  TIMON. Nay, an you begin to rail on society once, I am sworn not to give regard to you. Farewell, and come with better music.  [_Exit._]  APEMANTUS. So. Thou wilt not hear me now, thou shalt not then. I’ll lock thy heaven from thee. O, that men’s ears should be To counsel deaf, but not to flattery!  [_Exit._]
  ACT II  SCENE I. Athens. A room in a senator’s house
Enter a Senator with papers.  SENATOR. And late five thousand. To Varro and to Isidore He owes nine thousand, besides my former sum, Which makes it five-and-twenty. Still in motion Of raging waste! It cannot hold; it will not. If I want gold, steal but a beggar’s dog And give it Timon, why, the dog coins gold. If I would sell my horse, and buy twenty more Better than he, why, give my horse to Timon— Ask nothing, give it him—it foals me straight, And able horses. No porter at his gate, But rather one that smiles and still invites All that pass by. It cannot hold; no reason Can sound his state in safety. Caphis, ho! Caphis, I say!  Enter Caphis.  CAPHIS. Here, sir, what is your pleasure?  SENATOR. Get on your cloak and haste you to Lord Timon. Importune him for my moneys; be not ceased With slight denial, nor then silenced when “Commend me to your master”, and the cap Plays in the right hand, thus; but tell him, My uses cry to me, I must serve my turn Out of mine own, his days and times are past, And my reliances on his fracted dates Have smit my credit. I love and honour him, But must not break my back to heal his finger. Immediate are my needs, and my relief Must not be tossed and turned to me in words, But find supply immediate. Get you gone. Put on a most importunate aspect, A visage of demand, for I do fear When every feather sticks in his own wing, Lord Timon will be left a naked gull, Which flashes now a phoenix. Get you gone.  CAPHIS. I go, sir.  SENATOR. Take the bonds along with you, And have the dates in. Come.  CAPHIS. I will, sir.  SENATOR. Go.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. The same. A hall in Timon’s house  Enter Flavius with many bills in his hand.  FLAVIUS. No care, no stop, so senseless of expense, That he will neither know how to maintain it Nor cease his flow of riot. Takes no account How things go from him, nor resumes no care Of what is to continue. Never mind Was to be so unwise, to be so kind. What shall be done? He will not hear till feel. I must be round with him, now he comes from hunting. Fie, fie, fie, fie!  Enter Caphis and the Servants of Isidore and Varro.  CAPHIS. Good even, Varro. What, you come for money?  VARRO’S SERVANT. Is’t not your business too?  CAPHIS. It is. And yours too, Isidore?  ISIDORE’S SERVANT. It is so.  CAPHIS. Would we were all discharged!  VARRO’S SERVANT. I fear it.  CAPHIS. Here comes the lord.  Enter Timon and his train with Alcibiades  TIMON. So soon as dinner’s done, we’ll forth again, My Alcibiades. With me? What is your will?  CAPHIS. My lord, here is a note of certain dues.  TIMON. Dues? Whence are you?  CAPHIS. Of Athens here, my lord.  TIMON. Go to my steward.  CAPHIS. Please it your lordship, he hath put me off To the succession of new days this month. My master is awaked by great occasion To call upon his own and humbly prays you That with your other noble parts you’ll suit In giving him his right.  TIMON. Mine honest friend, I prithee but repair to me next morning.  CAPHIS. Nay, good my lord—  TIMON. Contain thyself, good friend.  VARRO’S SERVANT. One Varro’s servant, my good lord—  ISIDORE’S SERVANT. From Isidore. He humbly prays your speedy payment.  CAPHIS. If you did know, my lord, my master’s wants—  VARRO’S SERVANT. ’Twas due on forfeiture, my lord, six weeks and past.  ISIDORE’S SERVANT. Your steward puts me off, my lord, and I Am sent expressly to your lordship.  TIMON. Give me breath. I do beseech you, good my lords, keep on, I’ll wait upon you instantly.  [_Exeunt Alcibiades and Timon’s train._]  [_To Flavius_.] Come hither. Pray you, How goes the world, that I am thus encountered With clamorous demands of debt, broken bonds, And the detention of long-since-due debts Against my honour?  FLAVIUS. Please you, gentlemen, The time is unagreeable to this business. Your importunacy cease till after dinner, That I may make his lordship understand Wherefore you are not paid.  TIMON. Do so, my friends. See them well entertained.  [_Exit._]  FLAVIUS. Pray, draw near.  [_Exit._]  Enter Apemantus and Fool.  CAPHIS. Stay, stay, here comes the fool with Apemantus. Let’s ha’ some sport with ’em.  VARRO’S SERVANT. Hang him, he’ll abuse us.  ISIDORE’S SERVANT. A plague upon him, dog!  VARRO’S SERVANT. How dost, fool?  APEMANTUS. Dost dialogue with thy shadow?  VARRO’S SERVANT. I speak not to thee.  APEMANTUS. No, ’tis to thyself. [_To the Fool_.] Come away.  ISIDORE’S SERVANT. [_To Varro’s servant_.] There’s the fool hangs on your back already.  APEMANTUS. No, thou stand’st single; thou’rt not on him yet.  CAPHIS. Where’s the fool now?  APEMANTUS. He last asked the question. Poor rogues and usurers’ men, bawds between gold and want.  ALL SERVANTS. What are we, Apemantus?  APEMANTUS. Asses.  ALL SERVANTS. Why?  APEMANTUS. That you ask me what you are, and do not know yourselves. Speak to ’em, fool.  FOOL. How do you, gentlemen?  ALL SERVANTS. Gramercies, good fool. How does your mistress?  FOOL. She’s e’en setting on water to scald such chickens as you are. Would we could see you at Corinth!  APEMANTUS. Good, gramercy.  Enter Page.  FOOL. Look you, here comes my mistress’ page.  PAGE. [_To the Fool_.] Why, how now, captain? What do you in this wise company? How dost thou, Apemantus?  APEMANTUS. Would I had a rod in my mouth, that I might answer thee profitably.  PAGE. Prithee, Apemantus, read me the superscription of these letters. I know not which is which.  APEMANTUS. Canst not read?  PAGE. No.  APEMANTUS. There will little learning die, then, that day thou art hanged. This is to Lord Timon, this to Alcibiades. Go, thou wast born a bastard, and thou’lt die a bawd.  PAGE. Thou wast whelped a dog, and thou shalt famish a dog’s death. Answer not; I am gone.  [_Exit Page._]  APEMANTUS. E’en so thou outrunn’st grace. Fool, I will go with you to Lord Timon’s.  FOOL. Will you leave me there?  APEMANTUS. If Timon stay at home.—You three serve three usurers?  ALL SERVANTS. Ay, would they served us!  APEMANTUS. So would I—as good a trick as ever hangman served thief.  FOOL. Are you three usurers’ men?  ALL SERVANTS. Ay, fool.  FOOL. I think no usurer but has a fool to his servant. My mistress is one, and I am her fool. When men come to borrow of your masters, they approach sadly and go away merry, but they enter my mistress’s house merrily and go away sadly. The reason of this?  VARRO’S SERVANT. I could render one.  APEMANTUS. Do it then, that we may account thee a whoremaster and a knave, which notwithstanding, thou shalt be no less esteemed.  VARRO’S SERVANT. What is a whoremaster, fool?  FOOL. A fool in good clothes, and something like thee. ’Tis a spirit; sometime ’t appears like a lord, sometime like a lawyer, sometime like a philosopher, with two stones more than’s artificial one. He is very often like a knight; and generally, in all shapes that man goes up and down in from fourscore to thirteen, this spirit walks in.  VARRO’S SERVANT. Thou art not altogether a fool.  FOOL. Nor thou altogether a wise man. As much foolery as I have, so much wit thou lack’st.  APEMANTUS. That answer might have become Apemantus.  VARRO’S SERVANT. Aside, aside, here comes Lord Timon.  Enter Timon and Flavius.  APEMANTUS. Come with me, fool, come.  FOOL. I do not always follow lover, elder brother, and woman; sometime the philosopher.  [_Exeunt Apemantus and Fool._]  FLAVIUS. Pray you walk near. I’ll speak with you anon.  [_Exeunt Servants._]  TIMON. You make me marvel wherefore ere this time Had you not fully laid my state before me, That I might so have rated my expense As I had leave of means.  FLAVIUS. You would not hear me, At many leisures I proposed.  TIMON. Go to. Perchance some single vantages you took When my indisposition put you back, And that unaptness made your minister Thus to excuse yourself.  FLAVIUS. O my good lord, At many times I brought in my accounts, Laid them before you; you would throw them off And say you found them in mine honesty. When for some trifling present you have bid me Return so much, I have shook my head and wept, Yea, ’gainst th’ authority of manners, prayed you To hold your hand more close. I did endure Not seldom nor no slight checks, when I have Prompted you in the ebb of your estate And your great flow of debts. My loved lord, Though you hear now, too late, yet now’s a time. The greatest of your having lacks a half To pay your present debts.  TIMON. Let all my land be sold.  FLAVIUS. ’Tis all engaged, some forfeited and gone, And what remains will hardly stop the mouth Of present dues; the future comes apace. What shall defend the interim? And at length How goes our reckoning?  TIMON. To Lacedaemon did my land extend.  FLAVIUS. O my good lord, the world is but a word; Were it all yours to give it in a breath, How quickly were it gone!  TIMON. You tell me true.  FLAVIUS. If you suspect my husbandry or falsehood, Call me before th’ exactest auditors And set me on the proof. So the gods bless me, When all our offices have been oppressed With riotous feeders, when our vaults have wept With drunken spilth of wine, when every room Hath blazed with lights and brayed with minstrelsy, I have retired me to a wasteful cock And set mine eyes at flow.  TIMON. Prithee, no more.  FLAVIUS. Heavens, have I said, the bounty of this lord! How many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants This night englutted? Who is not Timon’s? What heart, head, sword, force, means, but is Lord Timon’s? Great Timon, noble, worthy, royal Timon! Ah, when the means are gone that buy this praise, The breath is gone whereof this praise is made. Feast-won, fast-lost; one cloud of winter showers, These flies are couched.  TIMON. Come, sermon me no further. No villainous bounty yet hath passed my heart; Unwisely, not ignobly, have I given. Why dost thou weep? Canst thou the conscience lack To think I shall lack friends? Secure thy heart. If I would broach the vessels of my love And try the argument of hearts by borrowing, Men and men’s fortunes could I frankly use As I can bid thee speak.  FLAVIUS. Assurance bless your thoughts!  TIMON. And in some sort these wants of mine are crowned, That I account them blessings. For by these Shall I try friends. You shall perceive how you Mistake my fortunes. I am wealthy in my friends. Within there! Flaminius! Servilius!  Enter Flaminius, Servilius and a third Servant.  SERVANTS. My lord, my lord.  TIMON. I will dispatch you severally. [_To Servilius_.] You to Lord Lucius; [_To Flaminius_.] to Lord Lucullus you, I hunted with his honour today; [_To the third Servant_.] you to Sempronius. Commend me to their loves; and I am proud, say, that my occasions have found time to use ’em toward a supply of money. Let the request be fifty talents.  FLAMINIUS. As you have said, my lord.  [_Exeunt Servants._]  FLAVIUS. [_Aside_.] Lord Lucius and Lucullus? Humh!  TIMON. Go you, sir, to the senators, Of whom, even to the state’s best health, I have Deserved this hearing, Bid ’em send o’ th’ instant A thousand talents to me.  FLAVIUS. I have been bold— For that I knew it the most general way— To them to use your signet and your name, But they do shake their heads, and I am here No richer in return.  TIMON. Is’t true? Can’t be?  FLAVIUS. They answer in a joint and corporate voice That now they are at fall, want treasure, cannot Do what they would, are sorry. You are honourable, But yet they could have wished—they know not— Something hath been amiss—a noble nature May catch a wrench—would all were well—’tis pity. And so, intending other serious matters, After distasteful looks and these hard fractions, With certain half-caps and cold-moving nods They froze me into silence.  TIMON. You gods, reward them! Prithee, man, look cheerly. These old fellows Have their ingratitude in them hereditary. Their blood is caked, ’tis cold, it seldom flows; ’Tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind; And nature, as it grows again toward earth, Is fashioned for the journey, dull and heavy. Go to Ventidius. Prithee, be not sad, Thou art true and honest, ingenuously I speak, No blame belongs to thee. Ventidius lately Buried his father, by whose death he’s stepped Into a great estate. When he was poor, Imprisoned and in scarcity of friends, I cleared him with five talents. Greet him from me, Bid him suppose some good necessity Touches his friend, which craves to be remembered With those five talents. That had, give’t these fellows To whom ’tis instant due. Ne’er speak, or think That Timon’s fortunes ’mong his friends can sink.  [_Exit._]  FLAVIUS. I would I could not think it. That thought is bounty’s foe; Being free itself, it thinks all others so.  [_Exit._]
  ACT III  SCENE I. Athens. A room in Lucullus’ house
Flaminius waiting to speak with Lucullus from his master.  Enter a Servant to him.  SERVANT. I have told my lord of you; he is coming down to you.  FLAMINIUS. I thank you, sir.  Enter Lucullus.  SERVANT. Here’s my lord.  LUCULLUS. [_Aside_.] One of Lord Timon’s men? A gift, I warrant. Why, this hits right. I dreamt of a silver basin and ewer tonight.—Flaminius, honest Flaminius, you are very respectively welcome, sir. Fill me some wine.  [_Exit Servant._]  And how does that honourable, complete, free-hearted gentleman of Athens, thy very bountiful good lord and master?  FLAMINIUS. His health is well, sir.  LUCULLUS. I am right glad that his health is well, sir. And what hast thou there under thy cloak, pretty Flaminius?  FLAMINIUS. Faith, nothing but an empty box, sir, which in my lord’s behalf I come to entreat your honour to supply; who, having great and instant occasion to use fifty talents, hath sent to your lordship to furnish him, nothing doubting your present assistance therein.  LUCULLUS. La, la, la, la! Nothing doubting, says he? Alas, good lord! A noble gentleman ’tis, if he would not keep so good a house. Many a time and often I ha’ dined with him, and told him on’t, and come again to supper to him of purpose to have him spend less, and yet he would embrace no counsel, take no warning by my coming. Every man has his fault, and honesty is his. I ha’ told him on’t, but I could ne’er get him from ’t.  Enter Servant with wine.  SERVANT. Please your lordship, here is the wine.  LUCULLUS. Flaminius, I have noted thee always wise. Here’s to thee.  FLAMINIUS. Your lordship speaks your pleasure.  LUCULLUS. I have observed thee always for a towardly prompt spirit, give thee thy due, and one that knows what belongs to reason, and canst use the time well, if the time use thee well. Good parts in thee. [_To Servant_.] Get you gone, sirrah.—  [_Exit Servant._]  Draw nearer, honest Flaminius. Thy lord’s a bountiful gentleman, but thou art wise and thou know’st well enough, although thou com’st to me, that this is no time to lend money, especially upon bare friendship without security. Here’s three solidares for thee. Good boy, wink at me, and say thou saw’st me not. Fare thee well.  FLAMINIUS. Is’t possible the world should so much differ, And we alive that lived? Fly, damned baseness, To him that worships thee.  [_Throws the money back._]  LUCULLUS. Ha! Now I see thou art a fool and fit for thy master.  [_Exit._]  FLAMINIUS. May these add to the number that may scald thee! Let molten coin be thy damnation, Thou disease of a friend, and not himself! Has friendship such a faint and milky heart It turns in less than two nights? O you gods, I feel my master’s passion. This slave Unto his honour has my lord’s meat in him. Why should it thrive and turn to nutriment When he is turned to poison? O, may diseases only work upon’t, And when he’s sick to death, let not that part of nature Which my lord paid for be of any power To expel sickness, but prolong his hour.  [_Exit._]  SCENE II. A public place  Enter Lucius with three Strangers.  LUCIUS. Who, the Lord Timon? He is my very good friend and an honourable gentleman.  FIRST STRANGER. We know him for no less, though we are but strangers to him. But I can tell you one thing, my lord, and which I hear from common rumours: now Lord Timon’s happy hours are done and past, and his estate shrinks from him.  LUCIUS. Fie, no, do not believe it; he cannot want for money.  SECOND STRANGER. But believe you this, my lord, that, not long ago one of his men was with the Lord Lucullus to borrow so many talents, nay, urged extremely for’t, and showed what necessity belonged to’t, and yet was denied.  LUCIUS. How?  SECOND STRANGER. I tell you, denied, my lord.  LUCIUS. What a strange case was that! Now, before the gods, I am ashamed on’t. Denied that honourable man? There was very little honour showed in’t. For my own part, I must needs confess, I have received some small kindnesses from him, as money, plate, jewels, and such like trifles, nothing comparing to his; yet had he mistook him, and sent to me, I should ne’er have denied his occasion so many talents.  Enter Servilius.  SERVILIUS. See, by good hap, yonder’s my lord; I have sweat to see his honour. [_To Lucius_.] My honoured lord!  LUCIUS. Servilius? You are kindly met, sir. Fare thee well. Commend me to thy honourable virtuous lord, my very exquisite friend.  SERVILIUS. May it please your honour, my lord hath sent—  LUCIUS. Ha! What has he sent? I am so much endeared to that lord; he’s ever sending. How shall I thank him, thinkest thou? And what has he sent now?  SERVILIUS. Has only sent his present occasion now, my lord, requesting your lordship to supply his instant use with so many talents.  LUCIUS. I know his lordship is but merry with me; He cannot want fifty-five hundred talents.  SERVILIUS. But in the meantime he wants less, my lord. If his occasion were not virtuous, I should not urge it half so faithfully.  LUCIUS. Dost thou speak seriously, Servilius?  SERVILIUS. Upon my soul, ’tis true, sir.  LUCIUS. What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself against such a good time, when I might ha’ shown myself honourable! How unluckily it happened that I should purchase the day before for a little part, and undo a great deal of honour! Servilius, now before the gods, I am not able to do—the more beast, I say—I was sending to use Lord Timon myself, these gentlemen can witness; but I would not for the wealth of Athens I had done it now. Commend me bountifully to his good lordship, and I hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me, because I have no power to be kind. And tell him this from me: I count it one of my greatest afflictions, say, that I cannot pleasure such an honourable gentleman. Good Servilius, will you befriend me so far as to use mine own words to him?  SERVILIUS. Yes, sir, I shall.  LUCIUS. I’ll look you out a good turn, Servilius.  [_Exit Servilius._]  True, as you said, Timon is shrunk indeed, And he that’s once denied will hardly speed.  [_Exit._]  FIRST STRANGER. Do you observe this, Hostilius?  SECOND STRANGER. Ay, too well.  FIRST STRANGER. Why, this is the world’s soul, and just of the same piece Is every flatterer’s spirit. Who can call him his friend That dips in the same dish? For, in my knowing, Timon has been this lord’s father And kept his credit with his purse, Supported his estate, nay, Timon’s money Has paid his men their wages. He ne’er drinks But Timon’s silver treads upon his lip, And yet—O, see the monstrousness of man When he looks out in an ungrateful shape— He does deny him, in respect of his, What charitable men afford to beggars.  THIRD STRANGER. Religion groans at it.  FIRST STRANGER. For mine own part, I never tasted Timon in my life, Nor came any of his bounties over me To mark me for his friend. Yet I protest, For his right noble mind, illustrious virtue, And honourable carriage, Had his necessity made use of me, I would have put my wealth into donation, And the best half should have returned to him, So much I love his heart. But I perceive Men must learn now with pity to dispense, For policy sits above conscience.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. The same. A room in Sempronius’ house  Enter a Third Servant  of Timon’s with Sempronius, another of Timon’s friends.  SEMPRONIUS. Must he needs trouble me in’t? Hum! ’Bove all others? He might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus; And now Ventidius is wealthy too, Whom he redeemed from prison. All these Owe their estates unto him.  SERVANT. My lord, They have all been touched and found base metal, For they have all denied him.  SEMPRONIUS. How? Have they denied him? Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him And does he send to me? Three? Humh! It shows but little love or judgment in him. Must I be his last refuge? His friends, like physicians, Thrive, give him over. Must I take th’ cure upon me? Has much disgraced me in’t. I’m angry at him, That might have known my place. I see no sense for’t But his occasions might have wooed me first; For, in my conscience, I was the first man That e’er received gift from him. And does he think so backwardly of me now That I’ll requite it last? No. So it may prove an argument of laughter To th’ rest, and I ’mongst lords be thought a fool. I’d rather than the worth of thrice the sum Had sent to me first, but for my mind’s sake; I’d such a courage to do him good. But now return, And with their faint reply this answer join: Who bates mine honour shall not know my coin.  [_Exit._]  SERVANT. Excellent! Your lordship’s a goodly villain. The devil knew not what he did when he made man politic; he crossed himself by’t, and I cannot think but, in the end the villainies of man will set him clear. How fairly this lord strives to appear foul! Takes virtuous copies to be wicked, like those that under hot ardent zeal would set whole realms on fire. Of such a nature is his politic love. This was my lord’s best hope, now all are fled Save only the gods. Now his friends are dead, Doors that were ne’er acquainted with their wards Many a bounteous year must be employed Now to guard sure their master. And this is all a liberal course allows, Who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house.  [_Exit._]  SCENE IV. A hall in Timon’s house  Enter two of Varro’s Servants meeting Titus and Hortensius and then Lucius, all Servants of Timon’s creditors, to wait for his coming out.  FIRST VARRO’S SERVANT. Well met, good morrow, Titus and Hortensius.  TITUS. The like to you, kind Varro.  HORTENSIUS. Lucius! What, do we meet together?  LUCIUS. Ay, and I think One business does command us all; For mine is money.  TITUS. So is theirs and ours.  Enter Philotus.  LUCIUS. And, sir, Philotus too!  PHILOTUS. Good day at once.  LUCIUS. Welcome, good brother. What do you think the hour?  PHILOTUS. Labouring for nine.  LUCIUS. So much?  PHILOTUS. Is not my lord seen yet?  LUCIUS. Not yet.  PHILOTUS. I wonder on’t, he was wont to shine at seven.  LUCIUS. Ay, but the days are waxed shorter with him. You must consider that a prodigal course Is like the sun’s, but not like his recoverable. I fear ’tis deepest winter in Lord Timon’s purse: That is, one may reach deep enough, and yet Find little.  PHILOTUS. I am of your fear for that.  TITUS. I’ll show you how t’ observe a strange event. Your lord sends now for money?  HORTENSIUS. Most true, he does.  TITUS. And he wears jewels now of Timon’s gift, For which I wait for money.  HORTENSIUS. It is against my heart.  LUCIUS. Mark how strange it shows, Timon in this should pay more than he owes, And e’en as if your lord should wear rich jewels And send for money for ’em.  HORTENSIUS. I’m weary of this charge, the gods can witness. I know my lord hath spent of Timon’s wealth, And now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth.  FIRST VARRO’S SERVANT. Yes, mine’s three thousand crowns. What’s yours?  LUCIUS. Five thousand mine.  FIRST VARRO’S SERVANT. ’Tis much deep, and it should seem by th’ sum Your master’s confidence was above mine, Else surely his had equalled.  Enter Flaminius.  TITUS. One of Lord Timon’s men.  LUCIUS. Flaminius? Sir, a word. Pray, is my lord ready to come forth?  FLAMINIUS. No, indeed he is not.  TITUS. We attend his lordship; pray, signify so much.  FLAMINIUS. I need not tell him that, he knows you are too diligent.  [_Exit Flaminius._]  Enter Flavius in a cloak, muffled.  LUCIUS. Ha, is not that his steward muffled so? He goes away in a cloud. Call him, call him.  TITUS. Do you hear, sir?  SECOND VARRO’S SERVANT. By your leave, sir.  FLAVIUS. What do you ask of me, my friend?  TITUS. We wait for certain money here, sir.  FLAVIUS. Ay, If money were as certain as your waiting, ’Twere sure enough. Why then preferred you not your sums and bills When your false masters eat of my lord’s meat? Then they could smile and fawn upon his debts, And take down th’ interest into their gluttonous maws. You do yourselves but wrong to stir me up, Let me pass quietly. Believe’t, my lord and I have made an end, I have no more to reckon, he to spend.  LUCIUS. Ay, but this answer will not serve.  FLAVIUS. If ’twill not serve, ’tis not so base as you, For you serve knaves.  [_Exit._]  FIRST VARRO’S SERVANT. How? What does his cashiered worship mutter?  SECOND VARRO’S SERVANT. No matter what, he’s poor, and that’s revenge enough. Who can speak broader than he that has no house to put his head in? Such may rail against great buildings.  Enter Servilius.  TITUS. O, here’s Servilius; now we shall know some answer.  SERVILIUS. If I might beseech you, gentlemen, to repair some other hour, I should derive much from’t. For take’t of my soul, my lord leans wondrously to discontent. His comfortable temper has forsook him, he’s much out of health and keeps his chamber.  LUCIUS. Many do keep their chambers are not sick. And if it be so far beyond his health, Methinks he should the sooner pay his debts And make a clear way to the gods.  SERVILIUS. Good gods!  TITUS. We cannot take this for answer, sir.  FLAMINIUS. [_Within_.] Servilius, help! My lord, my lord!  Enter Timon in a rage.  TIMON. What, are my doors opposed against my passage? Have I been ever free, and must my house Be my retentive enemy, my jail? The place which I have feasted, does it now, Like all mankind, show me an iron heart?  LUCIUS. Put in now, Titus.  TITUS. My lord, here is my bill.  LUCIUS. Here’s mine.  HORTENSIUS. And mine, my lord.  BOTH VARRO’S SERVANTS. And ours, my lord.  PHILOTUS. All our bills.  TIMON. Knock me down with ’em! Cleave me to the girdle.  LUCIUS. Alas, my lord—  TIMON. Cut my heart in sums!  TITUS. Mine, fifty talents.  TIMON. Tell out my blood.  LUCIUS. Five thousand crowns, my lord.  TIMON. Five thousand drops pays that. What yours, and yours?  FIRST VARRO’S SERVANT. My lord—  SECOND VARRO’S SERVANT. My lord—  TIMON. Tear me, take me, and the gods fall upon you!  [_Exit._]  HORTENSIUS. Faith, I perceive our masters may throw their caps at their money. These debts may well be called desperate ones, for a madman owes ’em.  [_Exeunt._]  Enter Timon and Flavius.  TIMON. They have e’en put my breath from me, the slaves. Creditors? Devils!  FLAVIUS. My dear lord—  TIMON. What if it should be so?  FLAVIUS. My lord—  TIMON. I’ll have it so.—My steward!  FLAVIUS. Here, my lord.  TIMON. So fitly? Go, bid all my friends again, Lucius, Lucullus, and Sempronius, all. I’ll once more feast the rascals.  FLAVIUS. O my lord, You only speak from your distracted soul; There is not so much left to furnish out A moderate table.  TIMON. Be it not in thy care. Go, I charge thee, invite them all. Let in the tide Of knaves once more. My cook and I’ll provide.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE V. The same. The senate house  Enter three Senators at one door, Alcibiades meeting them, with Attendants.  FIRST SENATOR. My lord, you have my voice to ’t. The fault’s Bloody. ’Tis necessary he should die. Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy.  SECOND SENATOR. Most true, the law shall bruise ’em.  ALCIBIADES. Honour, health, and compassion to the senate!  FIRST SENATOR. Now, captain?  ALCIBIADES. I am a humble suitor to your virtues, For pity is the virtue of the law, And none but tyrants use it cruelly. It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy Upon a friend of mine, who in hot blood Hath stepped into the law, which is past depth To those that without heed do plunge into’t. He is a man, setting his fate aside, Of comely virtues, Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice— An honour in him which buys out his fault— But with a noble fury and fair spirit, Seeing his reputation touched to death, He did oppose his foe; And with such sober and unnoted passion He did behave his anger, ere ’twas spent, As if he had but proved an argument.  FIRST SENATOR. You undergo too strict a paradox, Striving to make an ugly deed look fair. Your words have took such pains as if they laboured To bring manslaughter into form and set quarrelling Upon the head of valour, which indeed Is valour misbegot and came into the world When sects and factions were newly born. He’s truly valiant that can wisely suffer The worst that man can breathe, and make his wrongs His outsides to wear them like his raiment, carelessly, And ne’er prefer his injuries to his heart, To bring it into danger. If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill, What folly ’tis to hazard life for ill!  ALCIBIADES. My lord—  FIRST SENATOR. You cannot make gross sins look clear. To revenge is no valour, but to bear.  ALCIBIADES. My lords, then, under favour, pardon me If I speak like a captain. Why do fond men expose themselves to battle And not endure all threats? Sleep upon’t, And let the foes quietly cut their throats Without repugnancy? If there be Such valour in the bearing, what make we Abroad? Why, then, women are more valiant That stay at home, if bearing carry it, And the ass more captain than the lion, the felon Loaden with irons wiser than the judge, If wisdom be in suffering. O my lords, As you are great, be pitifully good. Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood? To kill, I grant, is sin’s extremest gust, But in defence, by mercy, ’tis most just. To be in anger is impiety, But who is man that is not angry? Weigh but the crime with this.  SECOND SENATOR. You breathe in vain.  ALCIBIADES. In vain? His service done At Lacedaemon and Byzantium Were a sufficient briber for his life.  FIRST SENATOR. What’s that?  ALCIBIADES. Why, I say, my lords, has done fair service And slain in fight many of your enemies. How full of valour did he bear himself In the last conflict, and made plenteous wounds!  SECOND SENATOR. He has made too much plenty with ’em. He’s a sworn rioter. He has a sin That often drowns him and takes his valour prisoner. If there were no foes, that were enough To overcome him. In that beastly fury, He has been known to commit outrages And cherish factions. ’Tis inferred to us His days are foul and his drink dangerous.  FIRST SENATOR. He dies.  ALCIBIADES. Hard fate! He might have died in war. My lords, if not for any parts in him, Though his right arm might purchase his own time And be in debt to none, yet, more to move you, Take my deserts to his and join ’em both. And, for I know your reverend ages love Security, I’ll pawn my victories, all My honour, to you upon his good returns. If by this crime he owes the law his life, Why, let the war receive’t in valiant gore, For law is strict, and war is nothing more.  FIRST SENATOR. We are for law. He dies. Urge it no more, On height of our displeasure. Friend or brother, He forfeits his own blood that spills another.  ALCIBIADES. Must it be so? It must not be. My lords, I do beseech you, know me.  SECOND SENATOR. How?  ALCIBIADES. Call me to your remembrances.  THIRD SENATOR. What?  ALCIBIADES. I cannot think but your age has forgot me, It could not else be I should prove so base To sue and be denied such common grace. My wounds ache at you.  FIRST SENATOR. Do you dare our anger? ’Tis in few words, but spacious in effect: We banish thee for ever.  ALCIBIADES. Banish me? Banish your dotage, banish usury, That makes the Senate ugly.  FIRST SENATOR. If, after two days’ shine, Athens contain thee, Attend our weightier judgment. And, not to swell our spirit, He shall be executed presently.  [_Exeunt Senators._]  ALCIBIADES. Now the gods keep you old enough, that you may live Only in bone, that none may look on you! I’m worse than mad. I have kept back their foes While they have told their money and let out Their coin upon large interest, I myself Rich only in large hurts. All those for this? Is this the balsam that the usuring senate Pours into captains’ wounds? Banishment. It comes not ill. I hate not to be banished. It is a cause worthy my spleen and fury, That I may strike at Athens. I’ll cheer up My discontented troops and lay for hearts. ’Tis honour with most lands to be at odds. Soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods.  [_Exit._]  SCENE VI. A room of state in Timon’s house  Music. Enter divers Friends at several doors.  FIRST FRIEND. The good time of day to you, sir.  SECOND FRIEND. I also wish it to you. I think this honourable lord did but try us this other day.  FIRST FRIEND. Upon that were my thoughts tiring when we encountered. I hope it is not so low with him as he made it seem in the trial of his several friends.  SECOND FRIEND. It should not be, by the persuasion of his new feasting.  FIRST FRIEND. I should think so. He hath sent me an earnest inviting, which many my near occasions did urge me to put off; but he hath conjured me beyond them, and I must needs appear.  SECOND FRIEND. In like manner was I in debt to my importunate business, but he would not hear my excuse. I am sorry, when he sent to borrow of me, that my provision was out.  FIRST FRIEND. I am sick of that grief too, as I understand how all things go.  SECOND FRIEND. Every man here’s so. What would he have borrowed you?  FIRST FRIEND. A thousand pieces.  SECOND FRIEND. A thousand pieces!  FIRST FRIEND. What of you?  SECOND FRIEND. He sent to me, sir—here he comes.  Enter Timon and Attendants.  TIMON. With all my heart, gentlemen both! And how fare you?  FIRST FRIEND. Ever at the best, hearing well of your lordship.  SECOND FRIEND. The swallow follows not summer more willing than we your lordship.  TIMON. [_Aside_.] Nor more willingly leaves winter, such summer birds are men. Gentlemen, our dinner will not recompense this long stay. Feast your ears with the music awhile, if they will fare so harshly o’ th’ trumpet’s sound; we shall to’t presently.  FIRST FRIEND. I hope it remains not unkindly with your lordship that I returned you an empty messenger.  TIMON. O, sir, let it not trouble you.  SECOND FRIEND. My noble lord—  TIMON. Ah, my good friend, what cheer?  SECOND FRIEND. My most honourable lord, I am e’en sick of shame that when your lordship this other day sent to me I was so unfortunate a beggar.  TIMON. Think not on’t, sir.  SECOND FRIEND. If you had sent but two hours before—  TIMON. Let it not cumber your better remembrance.  [_The banquet brought in._]  Come, bring in all together.  SECOND FRIEND. All covered dishes!  FIRST FRIEND. Royal cheer, I warrant you.  THIRD FRIEND. Doubt not that, if money and the season can yield it.  FIRST FRIEND. How do you? What’s the news?  THIRD FRIEND. Alcibiades is banished. Hear you of it?  FIRST AND SECOND FRIENDS. Alcibiades banished?  THIRD FRIEND. ’Tis so, be sure of it.  FIRST FRIEND. How, how?  SECOND FRIEND. I pray you, upon what?  TIMON. My worthy friends, will you draw near?  THIRD FRIEND. I’ll tell you more anon. Here’s a noble feast toward.  SECOND FRIEND. This is the old man still.  THIRD FRIEND. Will’t hold, will’t hold?  SECOND FRIEND. It does, but time will—and so—  THIRD FRIEND. I do conceive.  TIMON. Each man to his stool with that spur as he would to the lip of his mistress. Your diet shall be in all places alike. Make not a city feast of it, to let the meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place. Sit, sit. The gods require our thanks: You great benefactors, sprinkle our society with thankfulness. For your own gifts make yourselves praised, but reserve still to give, lest your deities be despised. Lend to each man enough, that one need not lend to another; for, were your godheads to borrow of men, men would forsake the gods. Make the meat be beloved more than the man that gives it. Let no assembly of twenty be without a score of villains. If there sit twelve women at the table, let a dozen of them be as they are. The rest of your foes, O gods, the senators of Athens, together with the common lag of people, what is amiss in them, you gods, make suitable for destruction. For these my present friends, as they are to me nothing, so in nothing bless them, and to nothing are they welcome. Uncover, dogs, and lap.  [_The dishes  are uncovered and prove to be full of lukewarm water._]  SOME SPEAK. What does his lordship mean?  SOME OTHER. I know not.  TIMON. May you a better feast never behold, You knot of mouth-friends! Smoke and lukewarm water Is your perfection. This is Timon’s last, Who, stuck and spangled with your flatteries, Washes it off and sprinkles in your faces Your reeking villainy.  [_Throws water in their faces._]  Live loathed, and long, Most smiling, smooth, detested parasites, Courteous destroyers, affable wolves, meek bears, You fools of fortune, trencher-friends, time’s flies, Cap-and-knee slaves, vapours, and minute-jacks! Of man and beast the infinite malady Crust you quite o’er! [_They stand_.] What, dost thou go? Soft! Take thy physic first; thou too, and thou! Stay, I will lend thee money, borrow none.  [_He attacks them and forces them out._]  What, all in motion? Henceforth be no feast Whereat a villain’s not a welcome guest. Burn, house! Sink Athens! Henceforth hated be Of Timon man and all humanity!  [_Exit._]  Enter Timon’s Friends, the Senators with other Lords.  FIRST FRIEND. How now, my lords?  SECOND FRIEND. Know you the quality of Lord Timon’s fury?  THIRD FRIEND. Push! Did you see my cap?  FOURTH FRIEND. I have lost my gown.  FIRST FRIEND. He’s but a mad lord, and nought but humours sways him. He gave me a jewel th’ other day, and now he has beat it out of my hat. Did you see my jewel?  THIRD FRIEND. Did you see my cap?  SECOND FRIEND. Here ’tis.  FOURTH FRIEND. Here lies my gown.  FIRST FRIEND. Let’s make no stay.  SECOND FRIEND. Lord Timon’s mad.  THIRD FRIEND. I feel’t upon my bones.  FOURTH FRIEND. One day he gives us diamonds, next day stones.  [_Exeunt._]
  ACT IV  SCENE I. Without the walls of Athens
  ACT V  SCENE I. The woods. Before Timon’s cave
Enter Poet and Painter.  PAINTER. As I took note of the place, it cannot be far where he abides.  POET. What’s to be thought of him? Does the rumour hold for true that he is so full of gold?  PAINTER. Certain. Alcibiades reports it; Phrynia and Timandra had gold of him. He likewise enriched poor straggling soldiers with great quantity. ’Tis said he gave unto his steward a mighty sum.  POET. Then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends?  PAINTER. Nothing else. You shall see him a palm in Athens again, and flourish with the highest. Therefore ’tis not amiss we tender our loves to him in this supposed distress of his. It will show honestly in us and is very likely to load our purposes with what they travail for, if it be a just and true report that goes of his having.  POET. What have you now to present unto him?  PAINTER. Nothing at this time but my visitation; only I will promise him an excellent piece.  POET. I must serve him so too, tell him of an intent that’s coming toward him.  PAINTER. Good as the best. Promising is the very air o’ th’ time; it opens the eyes of expectation. Performance is ever the duller for his act and, but in the plainer and simpler kind of people, the deed of saying is quite out of use. To promise is most courtly and fashionable; performance is a kind of will or testament which argues a great sickness in his judgment that makes it.  Enter Timon from his cave.  TIMON. [_Aside_.] Excellent workman! Thou canst not paint a man so bad as is thyself.  POET. I am thinking what I shall say I have provided for him. It must be a personating of himself, a satire against the softness of prosperity, with a discovery of the infinite flatteries that follow youth and opulency.  TIMON. [_Aside_.] Must thou needs stand for a villain in thine own work? Wilt thou whip thine own faults in other men? Do so, I have gold for thee.  POET. Nay, let’s seek him. Then do we sin against our own estate When we may profit meet and come too late.  PAINTER. True. When the day serves, before black-cornered night, Find what thou want’st by free and offered light. Come.  TIMON. [_Aside_.] I’ll meet you at the turn. What a god’s gold, That he is worshipped in a baser temple Than where swine feed! ’Tis thou that rigg’st the bark and plough’st the foam, Settlest admired reverence in a slave. To thee be worship, and thy saints for aye Be crowned with plagues, that thee alone obey! Fit I meet them.  [_He comes forward._]  POET. Hail, worthy Timon!  PAINTER. Our late noble master!  TIMON. Have I once lived to see two honest men?  POET. Sir, Having often of your open bounty tasted, Hearing you were retired, your friends fall’n off, Whose thankless natures—O abhorred spirits! Not all the whips of heaven are large enough— What, to you, Whose star-like nobleness gave life and influence To their whole being? I am rapt and cannot cover The monstrous bulk of this ingratitude With any size of words.  TIMON. Let it go naked. Men may see’t the better. You that are honest, by being what you are, Make them best seen and known.  PAINTER. He and myself Have travailed in the great shower of your gifts, And sweetly felt it.  TIMON. Ay, you are honest men.  PAINTER. We are hither come to offer you our service.  TIMON. Most honest men! Why, how shall I requite you? Can you eat roots and drink cold water? No?  BOTH. What we can do we’ll do, to do you service.  TIMON. Ye’re honest men. Ye’ve heard that I have gold, I am sure you have. Speak truth, you’re honest men.  PAINTER. So it is said, my noble lord; but therefore Came not my friend nor I.  TIMON. Good honest men! [_To Painter_.] Thou draw’st a counterfeit Best in all Athens. Thou’rt indeed the best, Thou counterfeit’st most lively.  PAINTER. So so, my lord.  TIMON. E’en so, sir, as I say. [_To the Poet_.] And for thy fiction, Why, thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth That thou art even natural in thine art. But for all this, my honest-natured friends, I must needs say you have a little fault. Marry, ’tis not monstrous in you, neither wish I You take much pains to mend.  BOTH. Beseech your honour To make it known to us.  TIMON. You’ll take it ill.  BOTH. Most thankfully, my lord.  TIMON. Will you indeed?  BOTH. Doubt it not, worthy lord.  TIMON. There’s never a one of you but trusts a knave That mightily deceives you.  BOTH. Do we, my lord?  TIMON. Ay, and you hear him cog, see him dissemble, Know his gross patchery, love him, feed him, Keep in your bosom, yet remain assured That he’s a made-up villain.  PAINTER. I know not such, my lord.  POET. Nor I.  TIMON. Look you, I love you well. I’ll give you gold. Rid me these villains from your companies, Hang them or stab them, drown them in a draught, Confound them by some course, and come to me, I’ll give you gold enough.  BOTH. Name them, my lord, let’s know them.  TIMON. You that way, and you this, but two in company. Each man apart, all single and alone, Yet an arch-villain keeps him company. [_To one_.] If where thou art, two villians shall not be, Come not near him. [_To the other_.] If thou wouldst not reside But where one villain is, then him abandon. Hence, pack! There’s gold. You came for gold, ye slaves. [_To one_.] You have work for me, there’s payment, hence! [_To the other_.] You are an alchemist; make gold of that. Out, rascal dogs!  [_Timon drives them out and then retires to his cave_]  SCENE II. The same  Enter Flavius and two Senators.  FLAVIUS. It is vain that you would speak with Timon. For he is set so only to himself That nothing but himself which looks like man Is friendly with him.  FIRST SENATOR. Bring us to his cave. It is our part and promise to th’ Athenians To speak with Timon.  SECOND SENATOR. At all times alike Men are not still the same: ’twas time and griefs That framed him thus. Time, with his fairer hand, Offering the fortunes of his former days, The former man may make him. Bring us to him And chance it as it may.  FLAVIUS. Here is his cave. Peace and content be here! Lord Timon! Timon, Look out and speak to friends. The Athenians By two of their most reverend senate greet thee. Speak to them, noble Timon.  Enter Timon out of his cave.  TIMON. Thou sun that comforts, burn! Speak and be hanged! For each true word, a blister, and each false Be as a cantherizing to the root o’ th’ tongue, Consuming it with speaking.  FIRST SENATOR. Worthy Timon—  TIMON. Of none but such as you, and you of Timon.  FIRST SENATOR. The senators of Athens greet thee, Timon.  TIMON. [_Aside_.] I thank them and would send them back the plague, Could I but catch it for them.  FIRST SENATOR. O, forget What we are sorry for ourselves in thee. The senators with one consent of love Entreat thee back to Athens, who have thought On special dignities, which vacant lie For thy best use and wearing.  SECOND SENATOR. They confess Toward thee forgetfulness too general gross, Which now the public body, which doth seldom Play the recanter, feeling in itself A lack of Timon’s aid, hath sense withal Of its own fall, restraining aid to Timon, And send forth us to make their sorrowed render, Together with a recompense more fruitful Than their offence can weigh down by the dram, Ay, even such heaps and sums of love and wealth, As shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs, And write in thee the figures of their love, Ever to read them thine.  TIMON. You witch me in it, Surprise me to the very brink of tears. Lend me a fool’s heart and a woman’s eyes And I’ll beweep these comforts, worthy senators.  FIRST SENATOR. Therefore so please thee to return with us, And of our Athens, thine and ours, to take The captainship, thou shalt be met with thanks, Allowed with absolute power, and thy good name Live with authority. So soon we shall drive back Of Alcibiades th’ approaches wild, Who like a boar too savage doth root up His country’s peace.  SECOND SENATOR. And shakes his threatening sword Against the walls of Athens.  FIRST SENATOR. Therefore, Timon—  TIMON. Well, sir, I will. Therefore I will, sir, thus: If Alcibiades kill my countrymen, Let Alcibiades know this of Timon, That Timon cares not. But if he sack fair Athens And take our goodly aged men by th’ beards, Giving our holy virgins to the stain Of contumelious, beastly, mad-brained war, Then let him know, and tell him Timon speaks it, In pity of our aged and our youth, I cannot choose but tell him that I care not; And—let him take’t at worst—for their knives care not While you have throats to answer. For myself, There’s not a whittle in th’ unruly camp But I do prize it at my love before The reverend’st throat in Athens. So I leave you To the protection of the prosperous gods, As thieves to keepers.  FLAVIUS. Stay not, all’s in vain.  TIMON. Why, I was writing of my epitaph; It will be seen tomorrow. My long sickness Of health and living now begins to mend And nothing brings me all things. Go, live still, Be Alcibiades your plague, you his, And last so long enough.  FIRST SENATOR. We speak in vain.  TIMON. But yet I love my country and am not One that rejoices in the common wrack, As common bruit doth put it.  FIRST SENATOR. That’s well spoke.  TIMON. Commend me to my loving countrymen.  FIRST SENATOR. These words become your lips as they pass through them.  SECOND SENATOR. And enter in our ears like great triumphers In their applauding gates.  TIMON. Commend me to them, And tell them that to ease them of their griefs, Their fears of hostile strokes, their aches, losses, Their pangs of love, with other incident throes That nature’s fragile vessel doth sustain In life’s uncertain voyage, I will some kindness do them; I’ll teach them to prevent wild Alcibiades’ wrath.  FIRST SENATOR. [_Aside_.] I like this well, he will return again.  TIMON. I have a tree which grows here in my close That mine own use invites me to cut down, And shortly must I fell it. Tell my friends, Tell Athens, in the sequence of degree From high to low throughout, that whoso please To stop affliction, let him take his haste, Come hither ere my tree hath felt the axe And hang himself. I pray you do my greeting.  FLAVIUS. Trouble him no further; thus you still shall find him.  TIMON. Come not to me again, but say to Athens Timon hath made his everlasting mansion Upon the beached verge of the salt flood, Who once a day with his embossed froth The turbulent surge shall cover; thither come, And let my gravestone be your oracle. Lips, let sour words go by, and language end: What is amiss, plague and infection mend; Graves only be men’s works and death their gain, Sun, hide thy beams, Timon hath done his reign.  [_Exit Timon into his cave._]  FIRST SENATOR. His discontents are unremovably Coupled to nature.  SECOND SENATOR. Our hope in him is dead. Let us return And strain what other means is left unto us In our dear peril.  FIRST SENATOR. It requires swift foot.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. Before the walls of Athens  Enter two other Senators, with a Messenger.  FIRST SENATOR. Thou hast painfully discovered. Are his files As full as thy report?  MESSENGER. I have spoke the least. Besides, his expedition promises Present approach.  SECOND SENATOR. We stand much hazard if they bring not Timon.  MESSENGER. I met a courier, one mine ancient friend, Whom, though in general part we were opposed, Yet our old love made a particular force And made us speak like friends. This man was riding From Alcibiades to Timon’s cave With letters of entreaty, which imported His fellowship i’ th’ cause against your city, In part for his sake moved.  Enter the other Senators from Timon.  THIRD SENATOR. Here come our brothers.  FIRST SENATOR. No talk of Timon, nothing of him expect. The enemy’s drum is heard, and fearful scouring Doth choke the air with dust. In, and prepare. Ours is the fall, I fear, our foe’s the snare.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IV. The woods. Timon’s cave, and a rude tomb seen  Enter a Soldier in the woods, seeking Timon.  SOLDIER. By all description this should be the place. Who’s here? Speak, ho! No answer? What is this? _Timon is dead, who hath outstretched his span. Some beast read this; there does not live a man._ Dead, sure, and this his grave. What’s on this tomb I cannot read. The character I’ll take with wax. Our captain hath in every figure skill, An aged interpreter, though young in days. Before proud Athens he’s set down by this, Whose fall the mark of his ambition is.  [_Exit._]  SCENE V. Before the walls of Athens  Trumpets sound. Enter Alcibiades with his powers before Athens.  ALCIBIADES. Sound to this coward and lascivious town Our terrible approach.  [_A parley sounds._]  The Senators appear upon the walls.  Till now you have gone on and filled the time With all licentious measure, making your wills The scope of justice. Till now myself and such As slept within the shadow of your power Have wandered with our traversed arms, and breathed Our sufferance vainly. Now the time is flush, When crouching marrow, in the bearer strong Cries of itself, “No more!” Now breathless wrong Shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease, And pursy insolence shall break his wind With fear and horrid flight.  FIRST SENATOR. Noble and young, When thy first griefs were but a mere conceit, Ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear, We sent to thee to give thy rages balm, To wipe out our ingratitude with loves Above their quantity.  SECOND SENATOR. So did we woo Transformed Timon to our city’s love By humble message and by promised means. We were not all unkind, nor all deserve The common stroke of war.  FIRST SENATOR. These walls of ours Were not erected by their hands from whom You have received your griefs; nor are they such That these great towers, trophies, and schools should fall For private faults in them.  SECOND SENATOR. Nor are they living Who were the motives that you first went out. Shame, that they wanted cunning, in excess Hath broke their hearts. March, noble lord, Into our city with thy banners spread. By decimation and a tithed death, If thy revenges hunger for that food Which nature loathes, take thou the destined tenth, And by the hazard of the spotted die Let die the spotted.  FIRST SENATOR. All have not offended. For those that were, it is not square to take, On those that are, revenge. Crimes, like lands, Are not inherited. Then, dear countryman, Bring in thy ranks but leave without thy rage; Spare thy Athenian cradle and those kin Which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall With those that have offended. Like a shepherd Approach the fold and cull th’ infected forth, But kill not all together.  SECOND SENATOR. What thou wilt, Thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile Than hew to ’t with thy sword.  FIRST SENATOR. Set but thy foot Against our rampired gates and they shall ope, So thou wilt send thy gentle heart before To say thou’lt enter friendly.  SECOND SENATOR. Throw thy glove, Or any token of thine honour else, That thou wilt use the wars as thy redress And not as our confusion, all thy powers Shall make their harbour in our town till we Have sealed thy full desire.  ALCIBIADES. Then there’s my glove; Descend and open your uncharged ports. Those enemies of Timon’s and mine own Whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof Fall, and no more. And, to atone your fears With my more noble meaning, not a man Shall pass his quarter or offend the stream Of regular justice in your city’s bounds, But shall be remedied to your public laws At heaviest answer.  BOTH. ’Tis most nobly spoken.  ALCIBIADES. Descend, and keep your words.  [_The Senators descend._]  Enter a Soldier.  SOLDIER. My noble general, Timon is dead, Entombed upon the very hem o’ th’ sea, And on his gravestone this insculpture, which With wax I brought away, whose soft impression Interprets for my poor ignorance.  ALCIBIADES. [_Reads the Epitaph._] _Here lies a wretched corse, of wretched soul bereft. Seek not my name. A plague consume you, wicked caitiffs left! Here lie I, Timon, who alive all living men did hate. Pass by and curse thy fill, but pass and stay not here thy gait._ These well express in thee thy latter spirits. Though thou abhorred’st in us our human griefs, Scorned’st our brains’ flow and those our droplets which From niggard nature fall, yet rich conceit Taught thee to make vast Neptune weep for aye On thy low grave, on faults forgiven. Dead Is noble Timon, of whose memory Hereafter more. Bring me into your city, And I will use the olive with my sword, Make war breed peace, make peace stint war, make each Prescribe to other, as each other’s leech. Let our drums strike.  [_Exeunt._]

Enter the Tribunes and Senators aloft. And then enter Saturninus and his followers at one door, and Bassianus and his followers at the other, with drums and trumpets.  SATURNINUS. Noble patricians, patrons of my right, Defend the justice of my cause with arms; And, countrymen, my loving followers, Plead my successive title with your swords. I am his firstborn son that was the last That wore the imperial diadem of Rome; Then let my father’s honours live in me, Nor wrong mine age with this indignity.  BASSIANUS. Romans, friends, followers, favourers of my right, If ever Bassianus, Caesar’s son, Were gracious in the eyes of royal Rome, Keep then this passage to the Capitol, And suffer not dishonour to approach The imperial seat, to virtue consecrate, To justice, continence, and nobility; But let desert in pure election shine, And, Romans, fight for freedom in your choice.  Enter Marcus Andronicus aloft, holding the crown.  MARCUS. Princes, that strive by factions and by friends Ambitiously for rule and empery, Know that the people of Rome, for whom we stand A special party, have by common voice, In election for the Roman empery, Chosen Andronicus, surnamed Pius For many good and great deserts to Rome. A nobler man, a braver warrior, Lives not this day within the city walls. He by the senate is accited home From weary wars against the barbarous Goths, That with his sons, a terror to our foes, Hath yoked a nation strong, trained up in arms. Ten years are spent since first he undertook This cause of Rome, and chastised with arms Our enemies’ pride. Five times he hath returned Bleeding to Rome, bearing his valiant sons In coffins from the field. And now at last, laden with honour’s spoils, Returns the good Andronicus to Rome, Renowned Titus, flourishing in arms. Let us entreat, by honour of his name Whom worthily you would have now succeed, And in the Capitol and senate’s right, Whom you pretend to honour and adore, That you withdraw you and abate your strength, Dismiss your followers, and, as suitors should, Plead your deserts in peace and humbleness.  SATURNINUS. How fair the tribune speaks to calm my thoughts!  BASSIANUS. Marcus Andronicus, so I do affy In thy uprightness and integrity, And so I love and honour thee and thine, Thy noble brother Titus and his sons, And her to whom my thoughts are humbled all, Gracious Lavinia, Rome’s rich ornament, That I will here dismiss my loving friends, And to my fortunes and the people’s favour Commit my cause in balance to be weighed.  [_Exeunt the followers of Bassianus._]  SATURNINUS. Friends, that have been thus forward in my right, I thank you all and here dismiss you all, And to the love and favour of my country Commit myself, my person, and the cause.  [_Exeunt the followers of Saturninus._]  Rome, be as just and gracious unto me As I am confident and kind to thee. Open the gates and let me in.  BASSIANUS. Tribunes, and me, a poor competitor.  [_Flourish. They go up into the Senate House._]  Enter a Captain.  CAPTAIN. Romans, make way! The good Andronicus, Patron of virtue, Rome’s best champion, Successful in the battles that he fights, With honour and with fortune is returned From where he circumscribed with his sword And brought to yoke the enemies of Rome.  Sound drums and trumpets, and then enter two of Titus’ sons, and then two men bearing a coffin covered with black; then two other sons; then Titus Andronicus; and then Tamora, the Queen of Goths and her sons Alarbus, Chiron and Demetrius with Aaron the Moor, and others as many as can be, then set down the coffin, and Titus speaks.  TITUS. Hail, Rome, victorious in thy mourning weeds! Lo, as the bark that hath discharged her fraught Returns with precious lading to the bay From whence at first she weighed her anchorage, Cometh Andronicus, bound with laurel boughs, To resalute his country with his tears, Tears of true joy for his return to Rome. Thou great defender of this Capitol, Stand gracious to the rites that we intend. Romans, of five-and-twenty valiant sons, Half of the number that King Priam had, Behold the poor remains, alive and dead. These that survive let Rome reward with love; These that I bring unto their latest home, With burial amongst their ancestors. Here Goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword. Titus, unkind, and careless of thine own, Why suffer’st thou thy sons, unburied yet, To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx? Make way to lay them by their brethren.  [_They open the tomb._]  There greet in silence, as the dead are wont, And sleep in peace, slain in your country’s wars. O sacred receptacle of my joys, Sweet cell of virtue and nobility, How many sons hast thou of mine in store, That thou wilt never render to me more?  LUCIUS. Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths, That we may hew his limbs, and on a pile _Ad manes fratrum_ sacrifice his flesh Before this earthy prison of their bones, That so the shadows be not unappeased, Nor we disturbed with prodigies on earth.  TITUS. I give him you, the noblest that survives, The eldest son of this distressed queen.  TAMORA. Stay, Roman brethren! Gracious conqueror, Victorious Titus, rue the tears I shed, A mother’s tears in passion for her son. And if thy sons were ever dear to thee, O, think my son to be as dear to me. Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome, To beautify thy triumphs and return Captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke; But must my sons be slaughtered in the streets For valiant doings in their country’s cause? O, if to fight for king and commonweal Were piety in thine, it is in these. Andronicus, stain not thy tomb with blood. Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods? Draw near them then in being merciful. Sweet mercy is nobility’s true badge. Thrice-noble Titus, spare my first-born son.  TITUS. Patient yourself, madam, and pardon me. These are their brethren whom your Goths beheld Alive and dead, and for their brethren slain Religiously they ask a sacrifice. To this your son is marked, and die he must, T’ appease their groaning shadows that are gone.  LUCIUS. Away with him, and make a fire straight, And with our swords, upon a pile of wood, Let’s hew his limbs till they be clean consumed.  [_Exeunt Titus’ sons with Alarbus._]  TAMORA. O cruel, irreligious piety!  CHIRON. Was never Scythia half so barbarous!  DEMETRIUS. Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome. Alarbus goes to rest, and we survive To tremble under Titus’ threat’ning look. Then, madam, stand resolved, but hope withal The self-same gods that armed the Queen of Troy With opportunity of sharp revenge Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent May favour Tamora, the queen of Goths, (When Goths were Goths and Tamora was queen) To quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes.  Enter the sons of Andronicus again with bloody swords.  LUCIUS. See, lord and father, how we have performed Our Roman rites. Alarbus’ limbs are lopped, And entrails feed the sacrificing fire, Whose smoke like incense doth perfume the sky. Remaineth naught but to inter our brethren, And with loud ’larums welcome them to Rome.  TITUS. Let it be so; and let Andronicus Make this his latest farewell to their souls.  [_Sound trumpets, and lay the coffin in the tomb._]  In peace and honour rest you here, my sons; Rome’s readiest champions, repose you here in rest, Secure from worldly chances and mishaps. Here lurks no treason, here no envy swells, Here grow no damned drugs; here are no storms, No noise, but silence and eternal sleep. In peace and honour rest you here, my sons.  Enter Lavinia.  LAVINIA. In peace and honour live Lord Titus long; My noble lord and father, live in fame. Lo, at this tomb my tributary tears I render for my brethren’s obsequies; And at thy feet I kneel, with tears of joy Shed on this earth for thy return to Rome. O, bless me here with thy victorious hand, Whose fortunes Rome’s best citizens applaud.  TITUS. Kind Rome, that hast thus lovingly reserved The cordial of mine age to glad my heart! Lavinia, live; outlive thy father’s days, And fame’s eternal date, for virtue’s praise.  Enter Marcus Andronicus and Tribunes; re-enter Saturninus, Bassianus and others.  MARCUS. Long live Lord Titus, my beloved brother, Gracious triumpher in the eyes of Rome.  TITUS. Thanks, gentle tribune, noble brother Marcus.  MARCUS. And welcome, nephews, from successful wars, You that survive, and you that sleep in fame. Fair lords, your fortunes are alike in all, That in your country’s service drew your swords; But safer triumph is this funeral pomp That hath aspired to Solon’s happiness And triumphs over chance in honour’s bed. Titus Andronicus, the people of Rome, Whose friend in justice thou hast ever been, Send thee by me, their tribune and their trust, This palliament of white and spotless hue, And name thee in election for the empire With these our late-deceased emperor’s sons. Be _candidatus_ then, and put it on, And help to set a head on headless Rome.  TITUS. A better head her glorious body fits Than his that shakes for age and feebleness. What, should I don this robe and trouble you? Be chosen with proclamations today, Tomorrow yield up rule, resign my life, And set abroad new business for you all? Rome, I have been thy soldier forty years, And led my country’s strength successfully, And buried one and twenty valiant sons, Knighted in field, slain manfully in arms, In right and service of their noble country. Give me a staff of honour for mine age, But not a sceptre to control the world. Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.  MARCUS. Titus, thou shalt obtain and ask the empery.  SATURNINUS. Proud and ambitious tribune, canst thou tell?  TITUS. Patience, Prince Saturninus.  SATURNINUS. Romans, do me right. Patricians, draw your swords, and sheathe them not Till Saturninus be Rome’s emperor. Andronicus, would thou were shipped to hell Rather than rob me of the people’s hearts!  LUCIUS. Proud Saturnine, interrupter of the good That noble-minded Titus means to thee!  TITUS. Content thee, prince; I will restore to thee The people’s hearts, and wean them from themselves.  BASSIANUS. Andronicus, I do not flatter thee, But honour thee, and will do till I die. My faction if thou strengthen with thy friends, I will most thankful be; and thanks to men Of noble minds is honourable meed.  TITUS. People of Rome, and people’s tribunes here, I ask your voices and your suffrages. Will you bestow them friendly on Andronicus?  TRIBUNES. To gratify the good Andronicus, And gratulate his safe return to Rome, The people will accept whom he admits.  TITUS. Tribunes, I thank you; and this suit I make, That you create your emperor’s eldest son, Lord Saturnine; whose virtues will, I hope, Reflect on Rome as Titan’s rays on earth, And ripen justice in this commonweal. Then, if you will elect by my advice, Crown him, and say “Long live our emperor!”  MARCUS. With voices and applause of every sort, Patricians and plebeians, we create Lord Saturninus Rome’s great emperor, And say “Long live our Emperor Saturnine!”  [_A long flourish._]  SATURNINUS. Titus Andronicus, for thy favours done To us in our election this day, I give thee thanks in part of thy deserts, And will with deeds requite thy gentleness. And for an onset, Titus, to advance Thy name and honourable family, Lavinia will I make my empress, Rome’s royal mistress, mistress of my heart, And in the sacred Pantheon her espouse. Tell me, Andronicus, doth this motion please thee?  TITUS. It doth, my worthy lord, and in this match I hold me highly honoured of your grace; And here in sight of Rome, to Saturnine, King and commander of our commonweal, The wide world’s emperor, do I consecrate My sword, my chariot, and my prisoners; Presents well worthy Rome’s imperious lord. Receive them then, the tribute that I owe, Mine honour’s ensigns humbled at thy feet.  SATURNINUS. Thanks, noble Titus, father of my life. How proud I am of thee and of thy gifts Rome shall record, and when I do forget The least of these unspeakable deserts, Romans, forget your fealty to me.  TITUS. [_To Tamora_.] Now, madam, are you prisoner to an emperor; To him that for your honour and your state Will use you nobly and your followers.  SATURNINUS. A goodly lady, trust me, of the hue That I would choose, were I to choose anew. Clear up, fair queen, that cloudy countenance. Though chance of war hath wrought this change of cheer, Thou com’st not to be made a scorn in Rome. Princely shall be thy usage every way. Rest on my word, and let not discontent Daunt all your hopes. Madam, he comforts you Can make you greater than the Queen of Goths. Lavinia, you are not displeased with this?  LAVINIA. Not I, my lord, sith true nobility Warrants these words in princely courtesy.  SATURNINUS. Thanks, sweet Lavinia. Romans, let us go. Ransomless here we set our prisoners free. Proclaim our honours, lords, with trump and drum.  [_Flourish. Saturninus and his Guards exit, with Drums and Trumpets. Tribunes and Senators exit aloft._]  BASSIANUS. Lord Titus, by your leave, this maid is mine.  TITUS. How, sir? Are you in earnest then, my lord?  BASSIANUS. Ay, noble Titus; and resolved withal To do myself this reason and this right.  MARCUS. _Suum cuique_ is our Roman justice. This prince in justice seizeth but his own.  LUCIUS. And that he will and shall, if Lucius live.  TITUS. Traitors, avaunt! Where is the emperor’s guard?  Enter Saturninus and his Guards.  Treason, my lord, Lavinia is surprised.  SATURNINUS. Surprised? By whom?  BASSIANUS. By him that justly may Bear his betrothed from all the world away.  [_Exeunt Bassianus and Marcus with Lavinia._]  MUTIUS. Brothers, help to convey her hence away, And with my sword I’ll keep this door safe.  [_Exeunt Lucius, Quintus and Martius._]  TITUS. Follow, my lord, and I’ll soon bring her back.  [_Exeunt Saturninus, Tamora, Demetrius, Chiron, Aaron, and Guards._]  MUTIUS. My lord, you pass not here.  TITUS. What, villain boy, Barr’st me my way in Rome?  [_Stabbing Mutius._]  MUTIUS. Help, Lucius, help!  [_Dies._]  Re-enter Lucius.  LUCIUS. My lord, you are unjust, and more than so, In wrongful quarrel you have slain your son.  TITUS. Nor thou nor he are any sons of mine; My sons would never so dishonour me. Traitor, restore Lavinia to the Emperor.  LUCIUS. Dead, if you will; but not to be his wife, That is another’s lawful promised love.  [_Exit._]  Enter aloft the Emperor Saturninus with Tamora and her two sons and Aaron the Moor.  SATURNINUS. No, Titus, no; the emperor needs her not, Nor her, nor thee, nor any of thy stock. I’ll trust by leisure him that mocks me once; Thee never, nor thy traitorous haughty sons, Confederates all thus to dishonour me. Was none in Rome to make a stale But Saturnine? Full well, Andronicus, Agree these deeds with that proud brag of thine That said’st I begged the empire at thy hands.  TITUS. O monstrous! What reproachful words are these?  SATURNINUS. But go thy ways; go, give that changing piece To him that flourished for her with his sword. A valiant son-in-law thou shalt enjoy; One fit to bandy with thy lawless sons, To ruffle in the commonwealth of Rome.  TITUS. These words are razors to my wounded heart.  SATURNINUS. And therefore, lovely Tamora, Queen of Goths, That like the stately Phœbe ’mongst her nymphs Dost overshine the gallant’st dames of Rome, If thou be pleased with this my sudden choice, Behold, I choose thee, Tamora, for my bride, And will create thee Empress of Rome. Speak, Queen of Goths, dost thou applaud my choice? And here I swear by all the Roman gods, Sith priest and holy water are so near, And tapers burn so bright, and everything In readiness for Hymenæus stand, I will not re-salute the streets of Rome, Or climb my palace, till from forth this place I lead espoused my bride along with me.  TAMORA. And here in sight of heaven to Rome I swear, If Saturnine advance the Queen of Goths, She will a handmaid be to his desires, A loving nurse, a mother to his youth.  SATURNINUS. Ascend, fair queen, Pantheon. Lords, accompany Your noble emperor and his lovely bride, Sent by the heavens for Prince Saturnine, Whose wisdom hath her fortune conquered. There shall we consummate our spousal rites.  [_Exeunt all but Titus._]  TITUS. I am not bid to wait upon this bride. Titus, when wert thou wont to walk alone, Dishonoured thus, and challenged of wrongs?  Re-enter Marcus, Lucius, Quintus and Martius.  MARCUS. O Titus, see, O, see what thou hast done! In a bad quarrel slain a virtuous son.  TITUS. No, foolish tribune, no; no son of mine, Nor thou, nor these, confederates in the deed That hath dishonoured all our family. Unworthy brother and unworthy sons!  LUCIUS. But let us give him burial, as becomes; Give Mutius burial with our brethren.  TITUS. Traitors, away! He rests not in this tomb. This monument five hundred years hath stood, Which I have sumptuously re-edified. Here none but soldiers and Rome’s servitors Repose in fame; none basely slain in brawls. Bury him where you can, he comes not here.  MARCUS. My lord, this is impiety in you. My nephew Mutius’ deeds do plead for him; He must be buried with his brethren.  MARTIUS. And shall, or him we will accompany.  TITUS. “And shall”? What villain was it spake that word?  QUINTUS. He that would vouch it in any place but here.  TITUS. What, would you bury him in my despite?  MARCUS. No, noble Titus, but entreat of thee To pardon Mutius and to bury him.  TITUS. Marcus, even thou hast struck upon my crest, And with these boys mine honour thou hast wounded. My foes I do repute you every one; So trouble me no more, but get you gone.  QUINTUS. He is not with himself; let us withdraw.  MARTIUS. Not I, till Mutius’ bones be buried.  [_Marcus and the sons of Titus kneel._]  MARCUS. Brother, for in that name doth nature plead,—  QUINTUS. Father, and in that name doth nature speak,—  TITUS. Speak thou no more, if all the rest will speed.  MARCUS. Renowned Titus, more than half my soul,—  LUCIUS. Dear father, soul and substance of us all,—  MARCUS. Suffer thy brother Marcus to inter His noble nephew here in virtue’s nest, That died in honour and Lavinia’s cause. Thou art a Roman; be not barbarous. The Greeks upon advice did bury Ajax, That slew himself; and wise Laertes’ son Did graciously plead for his funerals. Let not young Mutius, then, that was thy joy, Be barred his entrance here.  TITUS. Rise, Marcus, rise. The dismall’st day is this that e’er I saw, To be dishonoured by my sons in Rome! Well, bury him, and bury me the next.  [_They put Mutius in the tomb._]  LUCIUS. There lie thy bones, sweet Mutius, with thy friends, Till we with trophies do adorn thy tomb.  ALL. [_Kneeling_.] No man shed tears for noble Mutius; He lives in fame that died in virtue’s cause.  MARCUS. My lord, to step out of these dreary dumps, How comes it that the subtle Queen of Goths Is of a sudden thus advanced in Rome?  TITUS. I know not, Marcus, but I know it is. Whether by device or no, the heavens can tell. Is she not then beholding to the man That brought her for this high good turn so far? Yes, and will nobly him remunerate.  Flourish. Enter the Emperor Saturninus, Tamora and her two sons, with Aaron the Moor. Drums and Trumpets, at one door. Enter at the other door Bassianus and Lavinia with others.  SATURNINUS. So, Bassianus, you have played your prize. God give you joy, sir, of your gallant bride.  BASSIANUS. And you of yours, my lord. I say no more, Nor wish no less; and so I take my leave.  SATURNINUS. Traitor, if Rome have law or we have power, Thou and thy faction shall repent this rape.  BASSIANUS. Rape call you it, my lord, to seize my own, My true betrothed love, and now my wife? But let the laws of Rome determine all; Meanwhile am I possessed of that is mine.  SATURNINUS. ’Tis good, sir. You are very short with us; But if we live, we’ll be as sharp with you.  BASSIANUS. My lord, what I have done, as best I may, Answer I must, and shall do with my life. Only thus much I give your grace to know: By all the duties that I owe to Rome, This noble gentleman, Lord Titus here, Is in opinion and in honour wronged, That, in the rescue of Lavinia, With his own hand did slay his youngest son, In zeal to you, and highly moved to wrath To be controlled in that he frankly gave. Receive him then to favour, Saturnine, That hath expressed himself in all his deeds A father and a friend to thee and Rome.  TITUS. Prince Bassianus, leave to plead my deeds. ’Tis thou, and those, that have dishonoured me. Rome and the righteous heavens be my judge How I have loved and honoured Saturnine.  TAMORA. My worthy lord, if ever Tamora Were gracious in those princely eyes of thine, Then hear me speak indifferently for all; And at my suit, sweet, pardon what is past.  SATURNINUS. What, madam, be dishonoured openly, And basely put it up without revenge?  TAMORA. Not so, my lord; the gods of Rome forfend I should be author to dishonour you! But on mine honour dare I undertake For good Lord Titus’ innocence in all, Whose fury not dissembled speaks his griefs. Then at my suit look graciously on him; Lose not so noble a friend on vain suppose, Nor with sour looks afflict his gentle heart. [_Aside_.] My lord, be ruled by me, be won at last; Dissemble all your griefs and discontents. You are but newly planted in your throne; Lest, then, the people, and patricians too, Upon a just survey take Titus’ part, And so supplant you for ingratitude, Which Rome reputes to be a heinous sin, Yield at entreats, and then let me alone. I’ll find a day to massacre them all, And raze their faction and their family, The cruel father and his traitorous sons, To whom I sued for my dear son’s life; And make them know what ’tis to let a queen Kneel in the streets and beg for grace in vain. [_Aloud_.] Come, come, sweet emperor; come, Andronicus; Take up this good old man, and cheer the heart That dies in tempest of thy angry frown.  SATURNINUS. Rise, Titus, rise; my empress hath prevailed.  TITUS. I thank your majesty and her, my lord. These words, these looks, infuse new life in me.  TAMORA. Titus, I am incorporate in Rome, A Roman now adopted happily, And must advise the emperor for his good. This day all quarrels die, Andronicus; And let it be mine honour, good my lord, That I have reconciled your friends and you. For you, Prince Bassianus, I have passed My word and promise to the emperor That you will be more mild and tractable. And fear not, lords, and you, Lavinia. By my advice, all humbled on your knees, You shall ask pardon of his majesty.  LUCIUS. We do, and vow to heaven and to his highness That what we did was mildly as we might, Tend’ring our sister’s honour and our own.  MARCUS. That on mine honour here do I protest.  SATURNINUS. Away, and talk not; trouble us no more.  TAMORA. Nay, nay, sweet emperor, we must all be friends. The tribune and his nephews kneel for grace; I will not be denied. Sweet heart, look back.  SATURNINUS. Marcus, for thy sake, and thy brother’s here, And at my lovely Tamora’s entreats, I do remit these young men’s heinous faults. Stand up. Lavinia, though you left me like a churl, I found a friend, and sure as death I swore I would not part a bachelor from the priest. Come, if the emperor’s court can feast two brides, You are my guest, Lavinia, and your friends. This day shall be a love-day, Tamora.  TITUS. Tomorrow, an it please your majesty To hunt the panther and the hart with me, With horn and hound we’ll give your grace _bonjour_.  SATURNINUS. Be it so, Titus, and gramercy too.  [_Sound trumpets. Exeunt all but Aaron._]
  ACT II  SCENE I. Rome. Before the palace
Aaron alone.  AARON. Now climbeth Tamora Olympus’ top, Safe out of Fortune’s shot, and sits aloft, Secure of thunder’s crack or lightning’s flash, Advanced above pale envy’s threat’ning reach. As when the golden sun salutes the morn, And, having gilt the ocean with his beams, Gallops the zodiac in his glistening coach, And overlooks the highest-peering hills; So Tamora. Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait, And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown. Then, Aaron, arm thy heart and fit thy thoughts To mount aloft with thy imperial mistress, And mount her pitch, whom thou in triumph long Hast prisoner held, fett’red in amorous chains, And faster bound to Aaron’s charming eyes Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus. Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts! I will be bright, and shine in pearl and gold, To wait upon this new-made empress. To wait, said I? To wanton with this queen, This goddess, this Semiramis, this nymph, This siren, that will charm Rome’s Saturnine, And see his shipwrack and his commonweal’s. Holla! What storm is this?  Enter Chiron and Demetrius braving.  DEMETRIUS. Chiron, thy years wants wit, thy wit wants edge And manners, to intrude where I am graced, And may, for aught thou knowest, affected be.  CHIRON. Demetrius, thou dost overween in all, And so in this, to bear me down with braves. ’Tis not the difference of a year or two Makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate. I am as able and as fit as thou To serve and to deserve my mistress’ grace; And that my sword upon thee shall approve, And plead my passions for Lavinia’s love.  AARON. [_Aside_.] Clubs, clubs! These lovers will not keep the peace.  DEMETRIUS. Why, boy, although our mother, unadvised, Gave you a dancing-rapier by your side, Are you so desperate grown to threat your friends? Go to; have your lath glued within your sheath Till you know better how to handle it.  CHIRON. Meanwhile, sir, with the little skill I have, Full well shalt thou perceive how much I dare.  DEMETRIUS. Ay, boy, grow ye so brave?  [_They draw._]  AARON. Why, how now, lords! So near the emperor’s palace dare ye draw, And maintain such a quarrel openly? Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge. I would not for a million of gold The cause were known to them it most concerns; Nor would your noble mother for much more Be so dishonoured in the court of Rome. For shame, put up.  DEMETRIUS. Not I, till I have sheathed My rapier in his bosom, and withal Thrust those reproachful speeches down his throat That he hath breathed in my dishonour here.  CHIRON. For that I am prepared and full resolved, Foul-spoken coward, that thund’rest with thy tongue, And with thy weapon nothing dar’st perform.  AARON. Away, I say! Now, by the gods that warlike Goths adore, This pretty brabble will undo us all. Why, lords, and think you not how dangerous It is to jet upon a prince’s right? What, is Lavinia then become so loose, Or Bassianus so degenerate, That for her love such quarrels may be broached Without controlment, justice, or revenge? Young lords, beware! And should the empress know This discord’s ground, the music would not please.  CHIRON. I care not, I, knew she and all the world. I love Lavinia more than all the world.  DEMETRIUS. Youngling, learn thou to make some meaner choice. Lavina is thine elder brother’s hope.  AARON. Why, are ye mad? Or know ye not in Rome How furious and impatient they be, And cannot brook competitors in love? I tell you, lords, you do but plot your deaths By this device.  CHIRON. Aaron, a thousand deaths Would I propose to achieve her whom I love.  AARON. To achieve her! How?  DEMETRIUS. Why makes thou it so strange? She is a woman, therefore may be wooed; She is a woman, therefore may be won; She is Lavinia, therefore must be loved. What, man, more water glideth by the mill Than wots the miller of; and easy it is Of a cut loaf to steal a shive, we know. Though Bassianus be the emperor’s brother, Better than he have worn Vulcan’s badge.  AARON. [_Aside_.] Ay, and as good as Saturninus may.  DEMETRIUS. Then why should he despair that knows to court it With words, fair looks, and liberality? What, hast not thou full often struck a doe, And borne her cleanly by the keeper’s nose?  AARON. Why, then, it seems some certain snatch or so Would serve your turns.  CHIRON. Ay, so the turn were served.  DEMETRIUS. Aaron, thou hast hit it.  AARON. Would you had hit it too! Then should not we be tired with this ado. Why, hark ye, hark ye, and are you such fools To square for this? Would it offend you then That both should speed?  CHIRON. Faith, not me.  DEMETRIUS. Nor me, so I were one.  AARON. For shame, be friends, and join for that you jar. ’Tis policy and stratagem must do That you affect; and so must you resolve That what you cannot as you would achieve, You must perforce accomplish as you may. Take this of me: Lucrece was not more chaste Than this Lavinia, Bassianus’ love. A speedier course than ling’ring languishment Must we pursue, and I have found the path. My lords, a solemn hunting is in hand; There will the lovely Roman ladies troop. The forest walks are wide and spacious, And many unfrequented plots there are Fitted by kind for rape and villainy. Single you thither, then, this dainty doe, And strike her home by force, if not by words. This way, or not at all, stand you in hope. Come, come, our empress, with her sacred wit To villainy and vengeance consecrate, Will we acquaint with all what we intend; And she shall file our engines with advice That will not suffer you to square yourselves, But to your wishes’ height advance you both. The emperor’s court is like the house of Fame, The palace full of tongues, of eyes and ears; The woods are ruthless, dreadful, deaf, and dull. There speak and strike, brave boys, and take your turns; There serve your lust, shadowed from heaven’s eye, And revel in Lavinia’s treasury.  CHIRON. Thy counsel, lad, smells of no cowardice.  DEMETRIUS. _Sit fas aut nefas_, till I find the stream To cool this heat, a charm to calm these fits, _Per Stygia, per manes vehor._  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. A Forest near Rome; a Lodge seen at a distance. Horns and cry of hounds heard  Enter Titus Andronicus and his three sons, and Marcus, making a noise with hounds and horns.  TITUS. The hunt is up, the morn is bright and grey, The fields are fragrant, and the woods are green. Uncouple here, and let us make a bay, And wake the emperor and his lovely bride, And rouse the prince, and ring a hunter’s peal, That all the court may echo with the noise. Sons, let it be your charge, as it is ours, To attend the emperor’s person carefully. I have been troubled in my sleep this night, But dawning day new comfort hath inspired.  Here a cry of hounds, and wind horns in a peal. Then enter Saturninus, Tamora, Bassianus, Lavinia, Chiron, Demetrius, and their Attendants.  Many good morrows to your majesty; Madam, to you as many and as good. I promised your grace a hunter’s peal.  SATURNINUS. And you have rung it lustily, my lords; Somewhat too early for new-married ladies.  BASSIANUS. Lavinia, how say you?  LAVINIA. I say no; I have been broad awake two hours and more.  SATURNINUS. Come on then; horse and chariots let us have, And to our sport. [_To Tamora_.] Madam, now shall ye see Our Roman hunting.  MARCUS. I have dogs, my lord, Will rouse the proudest panther in the chase, And climb the highest promontory top.  TITUS. And I have horse will follow where the game Makes way, and run like swallows o’er the plain.  DEMETRIUS. Chiron, we hunt not, we, with horse nor hound, But hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. A lonely part of the Forest  Enter Aaron, alone, carrying a bag of gold.  AARON. He that had wit would think that I had none, To bury so much gold under a tree, And never after to inherit it. Let him that thinks of me so abjectly Know that this gold must coin a stratagem, Which, cunningly effected, will beget A very excellent piece of villainy. And so repose, sweet gold, for their unrest That have their alms out of the empress’ chest.  [_He hides the bag._]  Enter Tamora alone to the Moor.  TAMORA. My lovely Aaron, wherefore look’st thou sad When everything doth make a gleeful boast? The birds chant melody on every bush, The snakes lie rolled in the cheerful sun, The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind, And make a chequered shadow on the ground. Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit, And whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds, Replying shrilly to the well-tuned horns, As if a double hunt were heard at once, Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise; And after conflict such as was supposed The wand’ring prince and Dido once enjoyed, When with a happy storm they were surprised, And curtained with a counsel-keeping cave, We may, each wreathed in the other’s arms, Our pastimes done, possess a golden slumber, Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds Be unto us as is a nurse’s song Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep.  AARON. Madam, though Venus govern your desires, Saturn is dominator over mine. What signifies my deadly-standing eye, My silence and my cloudy melancholy, My fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls Even as an adder when she doth unroll To do some fatal execution? No, madam, these are no venereal signs. Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand, Blood and revenge are hammering in my head. Hark, Tamora, the empress of my soul, Which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee, This is the day of doom for Bassianus; His Philomel must lose her tongue today, Thy sons make pillage of her chastity, And wash their hands in Bassianus’ blood. Seest thou this letter? Take it up, I pray thee, And give the king this fatal-plotted scroll. Now question me no more; we are espied; Here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty, Which dreads not yet their lives’ destruction.  Enter Bassianus and Lavinia.  TAMORA. Ah, my sweet Moor, sweeter to me than life!  AARON. No more, great empress. Bassianus comes. Be cross with him; and I’ll go fetch thy sons To back thy quarrels, whatsoe’er they be.  [_Exit._]  BASSIANUS. Who have we here? Rome’s royal empress, Unfurnished of her well-beseeming troop? Or is it Dian, habited like her, Who hath abandoned her holy groves To see the general hunting in this forest?  TAMORA. Saucy controller of my private steps! Had I the power that some say Dian had, Thy temples should be planted presently With horns, as was Actaeon’s; and the hounds Should drive upon thy new-transformed limbs, Unmannerly intruder as thou art.  LAVINIA. Under your patience, gentle empress, ’Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning, And to be doubted that your Moor and you Are singled forth to try experiments. Jove shield your husband from his hounds today! ’Tis pity they should take him for a stag.  BASSIANUS. Believe me, queen, your swarthy Cimmerian Doth make your honour of his body’s hue, Spotted, detested, and abominable. Why are you sequestered from all your train, Dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed, And wandered hither to an obscure plot, Accompanied but with a barbarous Moor, If foul desire had not conducted you?  LAVINIA. And, being intercepted in your sport, Great reason that my noble lord be rated For sauciness. I pray you, let us hence, And let her joy her raven-coloured love; This valley fits the purpose passing well.  BASSIANUS. The king my brother shall have notice of this.  LAVINIA. Ay, for these slips have made him noted long. Good king, to be so mightily abused!  TAMORA. Why, I have patience to endure all this.  Enter Chiron and Demetrius.  DEMETRIUS. How now, dear sovereign, and our gracious mother! Why doth your highness look so pale and wan?  TAMORA. Have I not reason, think you, to look pale? These two have ticed me hither to this place, A barren detested vale you see it is; The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean, Overcome with moss and baleful mistletoe. Here never shines the sun, here nothing breeds, Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven. And when they showed me this abhorred pit, They told me, here, at dead time of the night, A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes, Ten thousand swelling toads, as many urchins, Would make such fearful and confused cries As any mortal body hearing it Should straight fall mad, or else die suddenly. No sooner had they told this hellish tale But straight they told me they would bind me here Unto the body of a dismal yew, And leave me to this miserable death. And then they called me foul adulteress, Lascivious Goth, and all the bitterest terms That ever ear did hear to such effect. And had you not by wondrous fortune come, This vengeance on me had they executed. Revenge it, as you love your mother’s life, Or be ye not henceforth called my children.  DEMETRIUS. This is a witness that I am thy son.  [_Stabs Bassianus._]  CHIRON. And this for me, struck home to show my strength.  [_Also stabs Bassianus, who dies._]  LAVINIA. Ay, come, Semiramis, nay, barbarous Tamora, For no name fits thy nature but thy own!  TAMORA. Give me thy poniard; you shall know, my boys, Your mother’s hand shall right your mother’s wrong.  DEMETRIUS. Stay, madam, here is more belongs to her. First thrash the corn, then after burn the straw. This minion stood upon her chastity, Upon her nuptial vow, her loyalty, And with that painted hope braves your mightiness; And shall she carry this unto her grave?  CHIRON. And if she do, I would I were an eunuch. Drag hence her husband to some secret hole, And make his dead trunk pillow to our lust.  TAMORA. But when ye have the honey ye desire, Let not this wasp outlive, us both to sting.  CHIRON. I warrant you, madam, we will make that sure. Come, mistress, now perforce we will enjoy That nice-preserved honesty of yours.  LAVINIA. O Tamora, thou bearest a woman’s face,—  TAMORA. I will not hear her speak; away with her!  LAVINIA. Sweet lords, entreat her hear me but a word.  DEMETRIUS. Listen, fair madam: let it be your glory To see her tears; but be your heart to them As unrelenting flint to drops of rain.  LAVINIA. When did the tiger’s young ones teach the dam? O, do not learn her wrath; she taught it thee; The milk thou suck’st from her did turn to marble; Even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny. Yet every mother breeds not sons alike. [_To Chiron_.] Do thou entreat her show a woman’s pity.  CHIRON. What, wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard?  LAVINIA. ’Tis true the raven doth not hatch a lark. Yet have I heard—O, could I find it now!— The lion, moved with pity, did endure To have his princely paws pared all away. Some say that ravens foster forlorn children, The whilst their own birds famish in their nests. O, be to me, though thy hard heart say no, Nothing so kind, but something pitiful.  TAMORA. I know not what it means; away with her!  LAVINIA. O, let me teach thee! For my father’s sake, That gave thee life when well he might have slain thee, Be not obdurate, open thy deaf ears.  TAMORA. Hadst thou in person ne’er offended me, Even for his sake am I pitiless. Remember, boys, I poured forth tears in vain To save your brother from the sacrifice, But fierce Andronicus would not relent. Therefore away with her, and use her as you will; The worse to her, the better loved of me.  LAVINIA. O Tamora, be called a gentle queen, And with thine own hands kill me in this place! For ’tis not life that I have begged so long; Poor I was slain when Bassianus died.  TAMORA. What begg’st thou, then? Fond woman, let me go.  LAVINIA. ’Tis present death I beg; and one thing more That womanhood denies my tongue to tell. O, keep me from their worse than killing lust, And tumble me into some loathsome pit, Where never man’s eye may behold my body. Do this, and be a charitable murderer.  TAMORA. So should I rob my sweet sons of their fee. No, let them satisfy their lust on thee.  DEMETRIUS. Away, for thou hast stayed us here too long.  LAVINIA. No grace, no womanhood? Ah, beastly creature, The blot and enemy to our general name! Confusion fall—  CHIRON. Nay, then I’ll stop your mouth. Bring thou her husband. This is the hole where Aaron bid us hide him.  [_They put Bassianus’s body in the pit and exit, carrying off Lavinia._]  TAMORA. Farewell, my sons. See that you make her sure. Ne’er let my heart know merry cheer indeed Till all the Andronici be made away. Now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor, And let my spleenful sons this trull deflower.  [_Exit._]  Enter Aaron with two of Titus’ sons, Quintus and Martius.  AARON. Come on, my lords, the better foot before. Straight will I bring you to the loathsome pit Where I espied the panther fast asleep.  QUINTUS. My sight is very dull, whate’er it bodes.  MARTIUS. And mine, I promise you. Were it not for shame, Well could I leave our sport to sleep awhile.  [_He falls into the pit._]  QUINTUS. What, art thou fallen? What subtle hole is this, Whose mouth is covered with rude-growing briers, Upon whose leaves are drops of new-shed blood As fresh as morning dew distilled on flowers? A very fatal place it seems to me. Speak, brother, hast thou hurt thee with the fall?  MARTIUS. O brother, with the dismall’st object hurt That ever eye with sight made heart lament!  AARON. [_Aside_.] Now will I fetch the king to find them here, That he thereby may have a likely guess How these were they that made away his brother.  [_Exit._]  MARTIUS. Why dost not comfort me, and help me out From this unhallowed and blood-stained hole?  QUINTUS. I am surprised with an uncouth fear; A chilling sweat o’er-runs my trembling joints. My heart suspects more than mine eye can see.  MARTIUS. To prove thou hast a true-divining heart, Aaron and thou look down into this den, And see a fearful sight of blood and death.  QUINTUS. Aaron is gone, and my compassionate heart Will not permit mine eyes once to behold The thing whereat it trembles by surmise. O, tell me who it is; for ne’er till now Was I a child to fear I know not what.  MARTIUS. Lord Bassianus lies berayed in blood, All on a heap, like to a slaughtered lamb, In this detested, dark, blood-drinking pit.  QUINTUS. If it be dark, how dost thou know ’tis he?  MARTIUS. Upon his bloody finger he doth wear A precious ring that lightens all the hole, Which, like a taper in some monument, Doth shine upon the dead man’s earthy cheeks, And shows the ragged entrails of the pit. So pale did shine the moon on Pyramus When he by night lay bathed in maiden blood. O brother, help me with thy fainting hand, If fear hath made thee faint, as me it hath, Out of this fell devouring receptacle, As hateful as Cocytus’ misty mouth.  QUINTUS. Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out, Or, wanting strength to do thee so much good, I may be plucked into the swallowing womb Of this deep pit, poor Bassianus’ grave. I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink.  MARTIUS. Nor I no strength to climb without thy help.  QUINTUS. Thy hand once more; I will not loose again, Till thou art here aloft, or I below. Thou canst not come to me. I come to thee.  [_Falls in._]  Enter the Emperor Saturninus and Aaron the Moor.  SATURNINUS. Along with me! I’ll see what hole is here, And what he is that now is leapt into it. Say, who art thou that lately didst descend Into this gaping hollow of the earth?  MARTIUS. The unhappy sons of old Andronicus, Brought hither in a most unlucky hour, To find thy brother Bassianus dead.  SATURNINUS. My brother dead! I know thou dost but jest. He and his lady both are at the lodge Upon the north side of this pleasant chase; ’Tis not an hour since I left them there.  MARTIUS. We know not where you left them all alive; But, out, alas, here have we found him dead.  Enter Tamora, Titus Andronicus and Lucius.  TAMORA. Where is my lord the king?  SATURNINUS. Here, Tamora; though grieved with killing grief.  TAMORA. Where is thy brother Bassianus?  SATURNINUS. Now to the bottom dost thou search my wound. Poor Bassianus here lies murdered.  TAMORA. Then all too late I bring this fatal writ, The complot of this timeless tragedy; And wonder greatly that man’s face can fold In pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny.  [_She giveth Saturnine a letter._]  SATURNINUS. [_Reads_.] _An if we miss to meet him handsomely, Sweet huntsman, Bassianus ’tis we mean, Do thou so much as dig the grave for him; Thou know’st our meaning. Look for thy reward Among the nettles at the elder-tree Which overshades the mouth of that same pit Where we decreed to bury Bassianus. Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends._ O Tamora, was ever heard the like? This is the pit, and this the elder-tree. Look, sirs, if you can find the huntsman out That should have murdered Bassianus here.  AARON. My gracious lord, here is the bag of gold.  [_Showing it._]  SATURNINUS. [_To Titus_.] Two of thy whelps, fell curs of bloody kind, Have here bereft my brother of his life. Sirs, drag them from the pit unto the prison. There let them bide until we have devised Some never-heard-of torturing pain for them.  TAMORA. What, are they in this pit? O wondrous thing! How easily murder is discovered!  TITUS. High emperor, upon my feeble knee I beg this boon, with tears not lightly shed, That this fell fault of my accursed sons, Accursed if the fault be proved in them—  SATURNINUS. If it be proved! You see it is apparent. Who found this letter? Tamora, was it you?  TAMORA. Andronicus himself did take it up.  TITUS. I did, my lord, yet let me be their bail; For by my fathers’ reverend tomb I vow They shall be ready at your highness’ will To answer their suspicion with their lives.  SATURNINUS. Thou shalt not bail them. See thou follow me. Some bring the murdered body, some the murderers. Let them not speak a word; the guilt is plain; For, by my soul, were there worse end than death, That end upon them should be executed.  TAMORA. Andronicus, I will entreat the king. Fear not thy sons; they shall do well enough.  TITUS. Come, Lucius, come; stay not to talk with them.  [_Exeunt severally. Attendants bearing the body._]  SCENE IV. Another part of the Forest  Enter the empress’ sons, Demetrius and Chiron with Lavinia, her hands cut off, and her tongue cut out, and ravished.  DEMETRIUS. So, now go tell, an if thy tongue can speak, Who ’twas that cut thy tongue and ravished thee.  CHIRON. Write down thy mind, bewray thy meaning so, An if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe.  DEMETRIUS. See how with signs and tokens she can scrowl.  CHIRON. Go home, call for sweet water, wash thy hands.  DEMETRIUS. She hath no tongue to call, nor hands to wash; And so let’s leave her to her silent walks.  CHIRON. An ’twere my cause, I should go hang myself.  DEMETRIUS. If thou hadst hands to help thee knit the cord.  [_Exeunt Chiron and Demetrius._]  Enter Marcus, from hunting.  MARCUS. Who is this? My niece, that flies away so fast? Cousin, a word; where is your husband? If I do dream, would all my wealth would wake me! If I do wake, some planet strike me down, That I may slumber an eternal sleep! Speak, gentle niece, what stern ungentle hands Hath lopped and hewed and made thy body bare Of her two branches, those sweet ornaments Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in, And might not gain so great a happiness As half thy love? Why dost not speak to me? Alas, a crimson river of warm blood, Like to a bubbling fountain stirred with wind, Doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips, Coming and going with thy honey breath. But sure some Tereus hath deflowered thee, And, lest thou shouldst detect him, cut thy tongue. Ah, now thou turn’st away thy face for shame, And notwithstanding all this loss of blood, As from a conduit with three issuing spouts, Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan’s face Blushing to be encountered with a cloud. Shall I speak for thee, shall I say ’tis so? O, that I knew thy heart, and knew the beast, That I might rail at him to ease my mind. Sorrow concealed, like an oven stopped, Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is. Fair Philomela, why she but lost her tongue, And in a tedious sampler sewed her mind; But, lovely niece, that mean is cut from thee; A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met, And he hath cut those pretty fingers off That could have better sewed than Philomel. O, had the monster seen those lily hands Tremble like aspen leaves upon a lute, And make the silken strings delight to kiss them, He would not then have touched them for his life. Or had he heard the heavenly harmony Which that sweet tongue hath made, He would have dropped his knife, and fell asleep, As Cerberus at the Thracian poet’s feet. Come, let us go, and make thy father blind, For such a sight will blind a father’s eye. One hour’s storm will drown the fragrant meads; What will whole months of tears thy father’s eyes? Do not draw back, for we will mourn with thee. O, could our mourning ease thy misery!  [_Exeunt._]
  ACT III  SCENE I. Rome. A street
  ACT IV  SCENE I. Rome. Before Titus’s House
Enter Young Lucius and Lavinia running after him, and the boy flies from her with his books under his arm. Enter Titus and Marcus.  YOUNG LUCIUS. Help, grandsire, help! My aunt Lavinia Follows me everywhere, I know not why. Good uncle Marcus, see how swift she comes! Alas, sweet aunt, I know not what you mean.  MARCUS. Stand by me, Lucius. Do not fear thine aunt.  TITUS. She loves thee, boy, too well to do thee harm.  YOUNG LUCIUS Ay, when my father was in Rome she did.  MARCUS. What means my niece Lavinia by these signs?  TITUS. Fear her not, Lucius. Somewhat doth she mean. See, Lucius, see how much she makes of thee. Somewhither would she have thee go with her. Ah, boy, Cornelia never with more care Read to her sons than she hath read to thee Sweet poetry and Tully’s _Orator_.  MARCUS. Canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus?  YOUNG LUCIUS. My lord, I know not, I, nor can I guess, Unless some fit or frenzy do possess her; For I have heard my grandsire say full oft, Extremity of griefs would make men mad; And I have read that Hecuba of Troy Ran mad for sorrow. That made me to fear, Although, my lord, I know my noble aunt Loves me as dear as e’er my mother did, And would not, but in fury, fright my youth; Which made me down to throw my books, and fly, Causeless, perhaps. But pardon me, sweet aunt. And, madam, if my uncle Marcus go, I will most willingly attend your ladyship.  MARCUS. Lucius, I will.  [_Lavinia turns over with her stumps the books which Lucius has let fall._]  TITUS. How now, Lavinia? Marcus, what means this? Some book there is that she desires to see. Which is it, girl, of these? Open them, boy. But thou art deeper read and better skilled. Come and take choice of all my library, And so beguile thy sorrow, till the heavens Reveal the damned contriver of this deed. Why lifts she up her arms in sequence thus?  MARCUS. I think she means that there were more than one Confederate in the fact. Ay, more there was, Or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge.  TITUS. Lucius, what book is that she tosseth so?  YOUNG LUCIUS. Grandsire, ’tis Ovid’s _Metamorphosis_. My mother gave it me.  MARCUS. For love of her that’s gone, Perhaps, she culled it from among the rest.  TITUS. Soft! So busily she turns the leaves! Help her! What would she find? Lavinia, shall I read? This is the tragic tale of Philomel, And treats of Tereus’ treason and his rape; And rape, I fear, was root of thy annoy.  MARCUS. See, brother, see! Note how she quotes the leaves.  TITUS. Lavinia, wert thou thus surprised, sweet girl, Ravished and wronged, as Philomela was, Forced in the ruthless, vast, and gloomy woods? See, see! Ay, such a place there is where we did hunt,— O, had we never, never hunted there!— Patterned by that the poet here describes, By nature made for murders and for rapes.  MARCUS. O, why should nature build so foul a den, Unless the gods delight in tragedies?  TITUS. Give signs, sweet girl, for here are none but friends, What Roman lord it was durst do the deed. Or slunk not Saturnine, as Tarquin erst, That left the camp to sin in Lucrece’ bed?  MARCUS. Sit down, sweet niece. Brother, sit down by me. Apollo, Pallas, Jove, or Mercury, Inspire me, that I may this treason find! My lord, look here. Look here, Lavinia. This sandy plot is plain; guide, if thou canst, This after me. I have writ my name  [_He writes his name with his staff and guides it with feet and mouth._]  Without the help of any hand at all. Cursed be that heart that forced us to this shift! Write thou, good niece, and here display at last What God will have discovered for revenge. Heaven guide thy pen to print thy sorrows plain, That we may know the traitors and the truth!  [_She takes the staff in her mouth, and guides it with her stumps and writes._]  O, do ye read, my lord, what she hath writ?  TITUS. “_Stuprum_. Chiron. Demetrius.”  MARCUS. What, what! The lustful sons of Tamora Performers of this heinous bloody deed?  TITUS. _Magni Dominator poli, Tam lentus audis scelera, tam lentus vides?_  MARCUS. O, calm thee, gentle lord, although I know There is enough written upon this earth To stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts And arm the minds of infants to exclaims. My lord, kneel down with me; Lavinia, kneel; And kneel, sweet boy, the Roman Hector’s hope; And swear with me, as, with the woeful fere And father of that chaste dishonoured dame, Lord Junius Brutus sware for Lucrece’ rape, That we will prosecute, by good advice Mortal revenge upon these traitorous Goths, And see their blood, or die with this reproach.  TITUS. ’Tis sure enough, an you knew how. But if you hunt these bear-whelps, then beware; The dam will wake, and if she wind you once. She’s with the lion deeply still in league, And lulls him whilst she playeth on her back, And when he sleeps will she do what she list. You are a young huntsman, Marcus; let alone; And come, I will go get a leaf of brass, And with a gad of steel will write these words, And lay it by. The angry northern wind Will blow these sands like Sibyl’s leaves abroad, And where’s our lesson, then? Boy, what say you?  YOUNG LUCIUS. I say, my lord, that if I were a man, Their mother’s bedchamber should not be safe For these base bondmen to the yoke of Rome.  MARCUS. Ay, that’s my boy! Thy father hath full oft For his ungrateful country done the like.  YOUNG LUCIUS. And, uncle, so will I, an if I live.  TITUS. Come, go with me into mine armoury. Lucius, I’ll fit thee; and withal, my boy, Shall carry from me to the empress’ sons Presents that I intend to send them both. Come, come; thou’lt do my message, wilt thou not?  YOUNG LUCIUS. Ay, with my dagger in their bosoms, grandsire.  TITUS. No, boy, not so. I’ll teach thee another course. Lavinia, come. Marcus, look to my house. Lucius and I’ll go brave it at the court; Ay, marry, will we, sir; and we’ll be waited on.  [_Exeunt Titus, Lavinia and Young Lucius._]  MARCUS. O heavens, can you hear a good man groan And not relent, or not compassion him? Marcus, attend him in his ecstasy, That hath more scars of sorrow in his heart Than foemen’s marks upon his battered shield, But yet so just that he will not revenge. Revenge ye heavens for old Andronicus!  [_Exit._]  SCENE II. Rome. A Room in the Palace  Enter Aaron, Chiron and Demetrius at one door, and at the other door Young Lucius and another, with a bundle of weapons and verses writ upon them.  CHIRON. Demetrius, here’s the son of Lucius; He hath some message to deliver us.  AARON. Ay, some mad message from his mad grandfather.  YOUNG LUCIUS. My lords, with all the humbleness I may, I greet your honours from Andronicus; [_Aside_.] And pray the Roman gods confound you both.  DEMETRIUS. Gramercy, lovely Lucius. What’s the news?  YOUNG LUCIUS. [_Aside_.] That you are both deciphered, that’s the news, For villains marked with rape. [_Aloud_.] May it please you, My grandsire, well advised, hath sent by me The goodliest weapons of his armoury To gratify your honourable youth, The hope of Rome; for so he bid me say; And so I do, and with his gifts present Your lordships, that, whenever you have need, You may be armed and appointed well. And so I leave you both, [_Aside_.] like bloody villains.  [_Exeunt Young Lucius and Attendant._]  DEMETRIUS. What’s here? A scroll; and written round about? Let’s see: [_Reads_.] _Integer vitae, scelerisque purus, Non eget Mauri iaculis, nec arcu._  CHIRON. O, ’tis a verse in Horace; I know it well. I read it in the grammar long ago.  AARON. Ay, just; a verse in Horace; right, you have it. [_Aside_.] Now, what a thing it is to be an ass! Here’s no sound jest! The old man hath found their guilt, And sends them weapons wrapped about with lines, That wound, beyond their feeling, to the quick. But were our witty empress well afoot, She would applaud Andronicus’ conceit. But let her rest in her unrest awhile.— And now, young lords, was’t not a happy star Led us to Rome, strangers, and more than so, Captives, to be advanced to this height? It did me good before the palace gate To brave the tribune in his brother’s hearing.  DEMETRIUS. But me more good to see so great a lord Basely insinuate and send us gifts.  AARON. Had he not reason, Lord Demetrius? Did you not use his daughter very friendly?  DEMETRIUS. I would we had a thousand Roman dames At such a bay, by turn to serve our lust.  CHIRON. A charitable wish, and full of love.  AARON. Here lacks but your mother for to say amen.  CHIRON. And that would she for twenty thousand more.  DEMETRIUS. Come, let us go and pray to all the gods For our beloved mother in her pains.  AARON. [_Aside_.] Pray to the devils; the gods have given us over.  [_Trumpets sound._]  DEMETRIUS. Why do the emperor’s trumpets flourish thus?  CHIRON. Belike for joy the emperor hath a son.  DEMETRIUS. Soft, who comes here?  Enter Nurse with a blackamoor Child in her arms.  NURSE. Good morrow, lords. O, tell me, did you see Aaron the Moor?  AARON. Well, more or less, or ne’er a whit at all, Here Aaron is; and what with Aaron now?  NURSE. O gentle Aaron, we are all undone! Now help, or woe betide thee evermore!  AARON. Why, what a caterwauling dost thou keep! What dost thou wrap and fumble in thy arms?  NURSE. O, that which I would hide from heaven’s eye, Our empress’ shame and stately Rome’s disgrace. She is delivered, lords, she is delivered.  AARON. To whom?  NURSE. I mean, she’s brought a-bed.  AARON. Well, God give her good rest! What hath he sent her?  NURSE. A devil.  AARON. Why, then she is the devil’s dam. A joyful issue.  NURSE. A joyless, dismal, black, and sorrowful issue. Here is the babe, as loathsome as a toad Amongst the fair-faced breeders of our clime. The empress sends it thee, thy stamp, thy seal, And bids thee christen it with thy dagger’s point.  AARON. Zounds, ye whore, is black so base a hue? Sweet blowse, you are a beauteous blossom sure.  DEMETRIUS. Villain, what hast thou done?  AARON. That which thou canst not undo.  CHIRON. Thou hast undone our mother.  AARON. Villain, I have done thy mother.  DEMETRIUS. And therein, hellish dog, thou hast undone her. Woe to her chance, and damned her loathed choice! Accursed the offspring of so foul a fiend!  CHIRON. It shall not live.  AARON. It shall not die.  NURSE. Aaron, it must; the mother wills it so.  AARON. What, must it, nurse? Then let no man but I Do execution on my flesh and blood.  DEMETRIUS. I’ll broach the tadpole on my rapier’s point. Nurse, give it me; my sword shall soon dispatch it.  AARON. Sooner this sword shall plough thy bowels up.  [_Taking the baby._]  Stay, murderous villains, will you kill your brother? Now, by the burning tapers of the sky That shone so brightly when this boy was got, He dies upon my scimitar’s sharp point That touches this my first-born son and heir. I tell you, younglings, not Enceladus, With all his threatening band of Typhon’s brood, Nor great Alcides, nor the god of war, Shall seize this prey out of his father’s hands. What, what, ye sanguine, shallow-hearted boys! Ye white-limed walls, ye alehouse-painted signs! Coal-black is better than another hue In that it scorns to bear another hue; For all the water in the ocean Can never turn the swan’s black legs to white, Although she lave them hourly in the flood. Tell the empress from me, I am of age To keep mine own, excuse it how she can.  DEMETRIUS. Wilt thou betray thy noble mistress thus?  AARON. My mistress is my mistress; this my self; The vigour and the picture of my youth. This before all the world do I prefer; This maugre all the world will I keep safe, Or some of you shall smoke for it in Rome.  DEMETRIUS. By this our mother is for ever shamed.  CHIRON. Rome will despise her for this foul escape.  NURSE. The emperor in his rage will doom her death.  CHIRON. I blush to think upon this ignomy.  AARON. Why, there’s the privilege your beauty bears. Fie, treacherous hue, that will betray with blushing The close enacts and counsels of thy heart! Here’s a young lad framed of another leer. Look how the black slave smiles upon the father, As who should say “Old lad, I am thine own.” He is your brother, lords, sensibly fed Of that self blood that first gave life to you; And from your womb where you imprisoned were He is enfranchised and come to light. Nay, he is your brother by the surer side, Although my seal be stamped in his face.  NURSE. Aaron, what shall I say unto the empress?  DEMETRIUS. Advise thee, Aaron, what is to be done, And we will all subscribe to thy advice. Save thou the child, so we may all be safe.  AARON. Then sit we down, and let us all consult. My son and I will have the wind of you. Keep there. Now talk at pleasure of your safety.  [_They sit._]  DEMETRIUS. How many women saw this child of his?  AARON. Why, so, brave lords! When we join in league, I am a lamb; but if you brave the Moor, The chafed boar, the mountain lioness, The ocean swells not so as Aaron storms. But say again, how many saw the child?  NURSE. Cornelia the midwife and myself, And no one else but the delivered empress.  AARON. The empress, the midwife, and yourself. Two may keep counsel when the third’s away. Go to the empress; tell her this I said.  [_He kills her._]  “Wheak, wheak!” So cries a pig prepared to the spit.  DEMETRIUS. What mean’st thou, Aaron? Wherefore didst thou this?  AARON. O Lord, sir, ’tis a deed of policy. Shall she live to betray this guilt of ours, A long-tongued babbling gossip? No, lords, no. And now be it known to you my full intent. Not far, one Muliteus lives, my countryman; His wife but yesternight was brought to bed. His child is like to her, fair as you are. Go pack with him, and give the mother gold, And tell them both the circumstance of all, And how by this their child shall be advanced, And be received for the emperor’s heir, And substituted in the place of mine, To calm this tempest whirling in the court; And let the emperor dandle him for his own. Hark ye, lords; ye see I have given her physic,  [_Indicating the Nurse._]  And you must needs bestow her funeral; The fields are near, and you are gallant grooms. This done, see that you take no longer days, But send the midwife presently to me. The midwife and the nurse well made away, Then let the ladies tattle what they please.  CHIRON. Aaron, I see thou wilt not trust the air With secrets.  DEMETRIUS. For this care of Tamora, Herself and hers are highly bound to thee.  [_Exeunt Demetrius and Chiron, carrying the Nurse’s body._]  AARON. Now to the Goths, as swift as swallow flies, There to dispose this treasure in mine arms, And secretly to greet the empress’ friends. Come on, you thick-lipped slave, I’ll bear you hence; For it is you that puts us to our shifts. I’ll make you feed on berries and on roots, And feed on curds and whey, and suck the goat, And cabin in a cave, and bring you up To be a warrior and command a camp.  [_Exit._]  SCENE III. Rome. A public Place  Enter Titus, old Marcus, his son Publius, Young Lucius, and other gentlemen with bows, and Titus bears the arrows with letters on the ends of them.  TITUS. Come, Marcus, come. Kinsmen, this is the way. Sir boy, let me see your archery. Look ye draw home enough, and ’tis there straight. _Terras Astraea reliquit._ Be you remembered, Marcus, she’s gone, she’s fled. Sirs, take you to your tools. You, cousins, shall Go sound the ocean and cast your nets; Happily you may catch her in the sea; Yet there’s as little justice as at land. No; Publius and Sempronius, you must do it; ’Tis you must dig with mattock and with spade, And pierce the inmost centre of the earth. Then, when you come to Pluto’s region, I pray you, deliver him this petition; Tell him it is for justice and for aid, And that it comes from old Andronicus, Shaken with sorrows in ungrateful Rome. Ah, Rome! Well, well, I made thee miserable What time I threw the people’s suffrages On him that thus doth tyrannize o’er me. Go, get you gone; and pray be careful all, And leave you not a man-of-war unsearched. This wicked emperor may have shipped her hence; And, kinsmen, then we may go pipe for justice.  MARCUS. O Publius, is not this a heavy case, To see thy noble uncle thus distract?  PUBLIUS. Therefore, my lords, it highly us concerns By day and night to attend him carefully, And feed his humour kindly as we may, Till time beget some careful remedy.  MARCUS. Kinsmen, his sorrows are past remedy, But . . . . Join with the Goths, and with revengeful war Take wreak on Rome for this ingratitude, And vengeance on the traitor Saturnine.  TITUS. Publius, how now? How now, my masters? What, have you met with her?  PUBLIUS. No, my good lord; but Pluto sends you word, If you will have Revenge from hell, you shall. Marry, for Justice, she is so employed, He thinks, with Jove in heaven, or somewhere else, So that perforce you must needs stay a time.  TITUS. He doth me wrong to feed me with delays. I’ll dive into the burning lake below, And pull her out of Acheron by the heels. Marcus, we are but shrubs, no cedars we, No big-boned men framed of the Cyclops’ size; But metal, Marcus, steel to the very back, Yet wrung with wrongs more than our backs can bear; And sith there’s no justice in earth nor hell, We will solicit heaven and move the gods To send down Justice for to wreak our wrongs. Come, to this gear. You are a good archer, Marcus.  [_He gives them the arrows._]  “_Ad Jovem,_” that’s for you; here, “_Ad Apollinem_”; “_Ad Martem,_” that’s for myself; Here, boy, “to Pallas”; here, “to Mercury”; “To Saturn,” Caius, not to Saturnine; You were as good to shoot against the wind. To it, boy.—Marcus, loose when I bid.— Of my word, I have written to effect; There’s not a god left unsolicited.  MARCUS. Kinsmen, shoot all your shafts into the court. We will afflict the emperor in his pride.  TITUS. Now, masters, draw. [_They shoot_.] O, well said, Lucius! Good boy, in Virgo’s lap! Give it Pallas.  MARCUS. My lord, I aim a mile beyond the moon. Your letter is with Jupiter by this.  TITUS. Ha! ha! Publius, Publius, what hast thou done? See, see, thou hast shot off one of Taurus’ horns.  MARCUS. This was the sport, my lord; when Publius shot, The Bull, being galled, gave Aries such a knock That down fell both the Ram’s horns in the court; And who should find them but the empress’ villain? She laughed, and told the Moor he should not choose But give them to his master for a present.  TITUS. Why, there it goes. God give his lordship joy!  Enter the Clown with a basket and two pigeons in it.  News, news from heaven! Marcus, the post is come. Sirrah, what tidings? Have you any letters? Shall I have justice? What says Jupiter?  CLOWN. Ho, the gibbet-maker? He says that he hath taken them down again, for the man must not be hanged till the next week.  TITUS. But what says Jupiter, I ask thee?  CLOWN. Alas, sir, I know not Jubiter; I never drank with him in all my life.  TITUS. Why, villain, art not thou the carrier?  CLOWN. Ay, of my pigeons, sir; nothing else.  TITUS. Why, didst thou not come from heaven?  CLOWN. From heaven? Alas, sir, I never came there. God forbid I should be so bold to press to heaven in my young days. Why, I am going with my pigeons to the tribunal plebs, to take up a matter of brawl betwixt my uncle and one of the emperal’s men.  MARCUS. Why, sir, that is as fit as can be to serve for your oration; and let him deliver the pigeons to the emperor from you.  TITUS. Tell me, can you deliver an oration to the emperor with a grace?  CLOWN. Nay, truly, sir, I could never say grace in all my life.  TITUS. Sirrah, come hither. Make no more ado, But give your pigeons to the emperor. By me thou shalt have justice at his hands. Hold, hold; meanwhile here’s money for thy charges. Give me pen and ink. Sirrah, can you with a grace deliver up a supplication?  CLOWN. Ay, sir.  TITUS. Then here is a supplication for you. And when you come to him, at the first approach you must kneel; then kiss his foot; then deliver up your pigeons; and then look for your reward. I’ll be at hand, sir; see you do it bravely.  CLOWN. I warrant you, sir; let me alone.  TITUS. Sirrah, hast thou a knife? Come let me see it. Here, Marcus, fold it in the oration; For thou hast made it like a humble suppliant. And when thou hast given it to the emperor, Knock at my door, and tell me what he says.  CLOWN. God be with you, sir; I will.  [_Exit._]  TITUS. Come, Marcus, let us go. Publius, follow me.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IV. Rome. Before the Palace  Enter Emperor Saturninus and Empress Tamora and her two sons Chiron and Demetrius, with Attendants. The Emperor brings the arrows in his hand that Titus shot at him.  SATURNINUS. Why, lords, what wrongs are these! Was ever seen An emperor in Rome thus overborne, Troubled, confronted thus; and, for the extent Of legal justice, used in such contempt? My lords, you know, as know the mightful gods, However these disturbers of our peace Buzz in the people’s ears, there naught hath passed But even with law against the wilful sons Of old Andronicus. And what an if His sorrows have so overwhelmed his wits? Shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks, His fits, his frenzy, and his bitterness? And now he writes to heaven for his redress! See, here’s “to Jove,” and this “to Mercury,” This “to Apollo,” this to the god of war. Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome! What’s this but libelling against the senate, And blazoning our injustice everywhere? A goodly humour, is it not, my lords? As who would say, in Rome no justice were. But if I live, his feigned ecstasies Shall be no shelter to these outrages; But he and his shall know that justice lives In Saturninus’ health; whom, if she sleep, He’ll so awake as he in fury shall Cut off the proud’st conspirator that lives.  TAMORA. My gracious lord, my lovely Saturnine, Lord of my life, commander of my thoughts, Calm thee, and bear the faults of Titus’ age, Th’ effects of sorrow for his valiant sons, Whose loss hath pierced him deep and scarred his heart; And rather comfort his distressed plight Than prosecute the meanest or the best For these contempts. [_Aside_.] Why, thus it shall become High-witted Tamora to gloze with all. But, Titus, I have touched thee to the quick; Thy life-blood out, if Aaron now be wise, Then is all safe, the anchor in the port.  Enter Clown.  How now, good fellow, wouldst thou speak with us?  CLOWN. Yes, forsooth, an your mistresship be emperial.  TAMORA. Empress I am, but yonder sits the emperor.  CLOWN. ’Tis he. God and Saint Stephen give you good e’en. I have brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons here.  [_Saturninus reads the letter._]  SATURNINUS. Go take him away, and hang him presently.  CLOWN. How much money must I have?  TAMORA. Come, sirrah, you must be hanged.  CLOWN. Hanged! by’r Lady, then I have brought up a neck to a fair end.  [_Exit guarded._]  SATURNINUS. Despiteful and intolerable wrongs! Shall I endure this monstrous villainy? I know from whence this same device proceeds. May this be borne as if his traitorous sons, That died by law for murder of our brother, Have by my means been butchered wrongfully? Go, drag the villain hither by the hair; Nor age nor honour shall shape privilege. For this proud mock I’ll be thy slaughterman, Sly frantic wretch, that holp’st to make me great, In hope thyself should govern Rome and me.  Enter Aemilius.  What news with thee, Aemilius?  AEMILIUS. Arm, my lord! Rome never had more cause. The Goths have gathered head, and with a power Of high-resolved men, bent to the spoil, They hither march amain, under conduct Of Lucius, son to old Andronicus; Who threats, in course of this revenge, to do As much as ever Coriolanus did.  SATURNINUS. Is warlike Lucius general of the Goths? These tidings nip me, and I hang the head As flowers with frost, or grass beat down with storms. Ay, now begins our sorrows to approach. ’Tis he the common people love so much; Myself hath often overheard them say, When I have walked like a private man, That Lucius’ banishment was wrongfully, And they have wished that Lucius were their emperor.  TAMORA. Why should you fear? Is not your city strong?  SATURNINUS. Ay, but the citizens favour Lucius, And will revolt from me to succour him.  TAMORA. King, be thy thoughts imperious like thy name. Is the sun dimmed, that gnats do fly in it? The eagle suffers little birds to sing, And is not careful what they mean thereby, Knowing that with the shadow of his wings He can at pleasure stint their melody; Even so mayest thou the giddy men of Rome. Then cheer thy spirit; for know, thou emperor, I will enchant the old Andronicus With words more sweet, and yet more dangerous, Than baits to fish or honey-stalks to sheep, Whenas the one is wounded with the bait, The other rotted with delicious feed.  SATURNINUS. But he will not entreat his son for us.  TAMORA. If Tamora entreat him, then he will, For I can smooth and fill his aged ears With golden promises, that, were his heart Almost impregnable, his old ears deaf, Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue. [_to Aemilius_] Go thou before, be our ambassador. Say that the emperor requests a parley Of warlike Lucius, and appoint the meeting Even at his father’s house, the old Andronicus.  SATURNINUS. Aemilius, do this message honourably, And if he stand on hostage for his safety, Bid him demand what pledge will please him best.  AEMILIUS. Your bidding shall I do effectually.  [_Exit._]  TAMORA. Now will I to that old Andronicus, And temper him with all the art I have, To pluck proud Lucius from the warlike Goths. And now, sweet emperor, be blithe again, And bury all thy fear in my devices.  SATURNINUS. Then go successantly, and plead to him.  [_Exeunt._]

  PROLOGUE
In Troy, there lies the scene. From isles of Greece The princes orgulous, their high blood chaf’d, Have to the port of Athens sent their ships Fraught with the ministers and instruments Of cruel war. Sixty and nine that wore Their crownets regal from the Athenian bay Put forth toward Phrygia; and their vow is made To ransack Troy, within whose strong immures The ravish’d Helen, Menelaus’ queen, With wanton Paris sleeps—and that’s the quarrel. To Tenedos they come, And the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge Their war-like fraughtage. Now on Dardan plains The fresh and yet unbruised Greeks do pitch Their brave pavilions: Priam’s six-gated city, Dardan, and Tymbria, Ilias, Chetas, Troien, And Antenorides, with massy staples And corresponsive and fulfilling bolts, Stir up the sons of Troy. Now expectation, tickling skittish spirits On one and other side, Trojan and Greek, Sets all on hazard. And hither am I come A prologue arm’d, but not in confidence Of author’s pen or actor’s voice, but suited In like conditions as our argument, To tell you, fair beholders, that our play Leaps o’er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils, Beginning in the middle; starting thence away, To what may be digested in a play. Like or find fault; do as your pleasures are; Now good or bad, ’tis but the chance of war.
  ACT I  SCENE I. Troy. Before Priam’s palace.
  ACT II  SCENE I. The Grecian camp.
 Enter Ajax and Thersites.  AJAX. Thersites!  THERSITES. Agamemnon—how if he had boils, full, all over, generally?  AJAX. Thersites!  THERSITES. And those boils did run—say so. Did not the general run then? Were not that a botchy core?  AJAX. Dog!  THERSITES. Then there would come some matter from him; I see none now.  AJAX. Thou bitch-wolf’s son, canst thou not hear? Feel, then.   [_Strikes him_.]  THERSITES. The plague of Greece upon thee, thou mongrel beef-witted lord!  AJAX. Speak, then, thou unsalted leaven, speak. I will beat thee into handsomeness.  THERSITES. I shall sooner rail thee into wit and holiness; but I think thy horse will sooner con an oration than thou learn a prayer without book. Thou canst strike, canst thou? A red murrain o’ thy jade’s tricks!  AJAX. Toadstool, learn me the proclamation.  THERSITES. Dost thou think I have no sense, thou strikest me thus?  AJAX. The proclamation!  THERSITES. Thou art proclaim’d fool, I think.  AJAX. Do not, porpentine, do not; my fingers itch.  THERSITES. I would thou didst itch from head to foot and I had the scratching of thee; I would make thee the loathsomest scab in Greece. When thou art forth in the incursions, thou strikest as slow as another.  AJAX. I say, the proclamation.  THERSITES. Thou grumblest and railest every hour on Achilles; and thou art as full of envy at his greatness as Cerberus is at Proserpina’s beauty—ay, that thou bark’st at him.  AJAX. Mistress Thersites!  THERSITES. Thou shouldst strike him.  AJAX. Cobloaf!  THERSITES. He would pun thee into shivers with his fist, as a sailor breaks a biscuit.  AJAX. You whoreson cur!   [_Strikes him_.]  THERSITES. Do, do.  AJAX. Thou stool for a witch!  THERSITES. Ay, do, do; thou sodden-witted lord! Thou hast no more brain than I have in mine elbows; an asinico may tutor thee. You scurvy valiant ass! Thou art here but to thrash Trojans, and thou art bought and sold among those of any wit like a barbarian slave. If thou use to beat me, I will begin at thy heel and tell what thou art by inches, thou thing of no bowels, thou!  AJAX. You dog!  THERSITES. You scurvy lord!  AJAX. You cur!   [_Strikes him_.]  THERSITES. Mars his idiot! Do, rudeness; do, camel; do, do.   Enter Achilles and Patroclus.  ACHILLES. Why, how now, Ajax! Wherefore do ye thus? How now, Thersites! What’s the matter, man?  THERSITES. You see him there, do you?  ACHILLES. Ay; what’s the matter?  THERSITES. Nay, look upon him.  ACHILLES. So I do. What’s the matter?  THERSITES. Nay, but regard him well.  ACHILLES. Well! why, so I do.  THERSITES. But yet you look not well upon him; for whosomever you take him to be, he is Ajax.  ACHILLES. I know that, fool.  THERSITES. Ay, but that fool knows not himself.  AJAX. Therefore I beat thee.  THERSITES. Lo, lo, lo, lo, what modicums of wit he utters! His evasions have ears thus long. I have bobb’d his brain more than he has beat my bones. I will buy nine sparrows for a penny, and his pia mater is not worth the ninth part of a sparrow. This lord, Achilles—Ajax, who wears his wit in his belly and his guts in his head—I’ll tell you what I say of him.  ACHILLES. What?  THERSITES. I say this Ajax—   [_Ajax offers to strike him_.]  ACHILLES. Nay, good Ajax.  THERSITES. Has not so much wit—  ACHILLES. Nay, I must hold you.  THERSITES. As will stop the eye of Helen’s needle, for whom he comes to fight.  ACHILLES. Peace, fool.  THERSITES. I would have peace and quietness, but the fool will not— he there; that he; look you there.  AJAX. O thou damned cur! I shall—  ACHILLES. Will you set your wit to a fool’s?  THERSITES. No, I warrant you, the fool’s will shame it.  PATROCLUS. Good words, Thersites.  ACHILLES. What’s the quarrel?  AJAX. I bade the vile owl go learn me the tenour of the proclamation, and he rails upon me.  THERSITES. I serve thee not.  AJAX. Well, go to, go to.  THERSITES. I serve here voluntary.  ACHILLES. Your last service was suff’rance; ’twas not voluntary. No man is beaten voluntary. Ajax was here the voluntary, and you as under an impress.  THERSITES. E’en so; a great deal of your wit too lies in your sinews, or else there be liars. Hector shall have a great catch and knock out either of your brains: a’ were as good crack a fusty nut with no kernel.  ACHILLES. What, with me too, Thersites?  THERSITES. There’s Ulysses and old Nestor—whose wit was mouldy ere your grandsires had nails on their toes—yoke you like draught oxen, and make you plough up the wars.  ACHILLES. What, what?  THERSITES. Yes, good sooth. To Achilles, to Ajax, to—  AJAX. I shall cut out your tongue.  THERSITES. ’Tis no matter; I shall speak as much as thou afterwards.  PATROCLUS. No more words, Thersites; peace!  THERSITES. I will hold my peace when Achilles’ brach bids me, shall I?  ACHILLES. There’s for you, Patroclus.  THERSITES. I will see you hang’d like clotpoles ere I come any more to your tents. I will keep where there is wit stirring, and leave the faction of fools.   [_Exit_.]  PATROCLUS. A good riddance.  ACHILLES. Marry, this, sir, is proclaim’d through all our host, That Hector, by the fifth hour of the sun, Will with a trumpet ’twixt our tents and Troy, Tomorrow morning, call some knight to arms That hath a stomach; and such a one that dare Maintain I know not what; ’tis trash. Farewell.  AJAX. Farewell. Who shall answer him?  ACHILLES. I know not; ’tis put to lott’ry, otherwise, He knew his man.  AJAX. O, meaning you? I will go learn more of it.   [_Exeunt_.]  SCENE II. Troy. Priam’s palace.   Enter Priam, Hector, Troilus, Paris and Helenus.  PRIAM. After so many hours, lives, speeches spent, Thus once again says Nestor from the Greeks: ‘Deliver Helen, and all damage else— As honour, loss of time, travail, expense, Wounds, friends, and what else dear that is consum’d In hot digestion of this cormorant war— Shall be struck off.’ Hector, what say you to’t?  HECTOR. Though no man lesser fears the Greeks than I, As far as toucheth my particular, Yet, dread Priam, There is no lady of more softer bowels, More spongy to suck in the sense of fear, More ready to cry out ‘Who knows what follows?’ Than Hector is. The wound of peace is surety, Surety secure; but modest doubt is call’d The beacon of the wise, the tent that searches To th’ bottom of the worst. Let Helen go. Since the first sword was drawn about this question, Every tithe soul ’mongst many thousand dismes Hath been as dear as Helen—I mean, of ours. If we have lost so many tenths of ours To guard a thing not ours, nor worth to us, Had it our name, the value of one ten, What merit’s in that reason which denies The yielding of her up?  TROILUS. Fie, fie, my brother! Weigh you the worth and honour of a king, So great as our dread father’s, in a scale Of common ounces? Will you with counters sum The past-proportion of his infinite, And buckle in a waist most fathomless With spans and inches so diminutive As fears and reasons? Fie, for godly shame!  HELENUS. No marvel though you bite so sharp of reasons, You are so empty of them. Should not our father Bear the great sway of his affairs with reason, Because your speech hath none that tells him so?  TROILUS. You are for dreams and slumbers, brother priest; You fur your gloves with reason. Here are your reasons: You know an enemy intends you harm; You know a sword employ’d is perilous, And reason flies the object of all harm. Who marvels, then, when Helenus beholds A Grecian and his sword, if he do set The very wings of reason to his heels And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove, Or like a star disorb’d? Nay, if we talk of reason, Let’s shut our gates and sleep. Manhood and honour Should have hare hearts, would they but fat their thoughts With this cramm’d reason. Reason and respect Make livers pale and lustihood deject.  HECTOR. Brother, she is not worth what she doth cost the keeping.  TROILUS. What’s aught but as ’tis valued?  HECTOR. But value dwells not in particular will: It holds his estimate and dignity As well wherein ’tis precious of itself As in the prizer. ’Tis mad idolatry To make the service greater than the god, And the will dotes that is attributive To what infectiously itself affects, Without some image of th’affected merit.  TROILUS. I take today a wife, and my election Is led on in the conduct of my will; My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears, Two traded pilots ’twixt the dangerous shores Of will and judgement: how may I avoid, Although my will distaste what it elected, The wife I chose? There can be no evasion To blench from this and to stand firm by honour. We turn not back the silks upon the merchant When we have soil’d them; nor the remainder viands We do not throw in unrespective sieve, Because we now are full. It was thought meet Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks; Your breath with full consent bellied his sails; The seas and winds, old wranglers, took a truce, And did him service. He touch’d the ports desir’d; And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive He brought a Grecian queen, whose youth and freshness Wrinkles Apollo’s, and makes stale the morning. Why keep we her? The Grecians keep our aunt. Is she worth keeping? Why, she is a pearl Whose price hath launch’d above a thousand ships, And turn’d crown’d kings to merchants. If you’ll avouch ’twas wisdom Paris went— As you must needs, for you all cried ‘Go, go’— If you’ll confess he brought home worthy prize— As you must needs, for you all clapp’d your hands, And cried ‘Inestimable!’—why do you now The issue of your proper wisdoms rate, And do a deed that never Fortune did— Beggar the estimation which you priz’d Richer than sea and land? O theft most base, That we have stol’n what we do fear to keep! But thieves unworthy of a thing so stol’n That in their country did them that disgrace We fear to warrant in our native place!  CASSANDRA. [_Within_.] Cry, Trojans, cry.  PRIAM. What noise, what shriek is this?  TROILUS. ’Tis our mad sister; I do know her voice.  CASSANDRA. [_Within_.] Cry, Trojans.  HECTOR. It is Cassandra.   Enter Cassandra, raving.  CASSANDRA. Cry, Trojans, cry. Lend me ten thousand eyes, And I will fill them with prophetic tears.  HECTOR. Peace, sister, peace.  CASSANDRA. Virgins and boys, mid-age and wrinkled eld, Soft infancy, that nothing canst but cry, Add to my clamours. Let us pay betimes A moiety of that mass of moan to come. Cry, Trojans, cry. Practise your eyes with tears. Troy must not be, nor goodly Ilion stand; Our firebrand brother, Paris, burns us all. Cry, Trojans, cry, A Helen and a woe! Cry, cry. Troy burns, or else let Helen go.   [_Exit_.]  HECTOR. Now, youthful Troilus, do not these high strains Of divination in our sister work Some touches of remorse? Or is your blood So madly hot, that no discourse of reason, Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause, Can qualify the same?  TROILUS. Why, brother Hector, We may not think the justness of each act Such and no other than event doth form it; Nor once deject the courage of our minds Because Cassandra’s mad. Her brain-sick raptures Cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel Which hath our several honours all engag’d To make it gracious. For my private part, I am no more touch’d than all Priam’s sons; And Jove forbid there should be done amongst us Such things as might offend the weakest spleen To fight for and maintain.  PARIS. Else might the world convince of levity As well my undertakings as your counsels; But I attest the gods, your full consent Gave wings to my propension, and cut off All fears attending on so dire a project. For what, alas, can these my single arms? What propugnation is in one man’s valour To stand the push and enmity of those This quarrel would excite? Yet I protest, Were I alone to pass the difficulties, And had as ample power as I have will, Paris should ne’er retract what he hath done, Nor faint in the pursuit.  PRIAM. Paris, you speak Like one besotted on your sweet delights. You have the honey still, but these the gall; So to be valiant is no praise at all.  PARIS. Sir, I propose not merely to myself The pleasures such a beauty brings with it; But I would have the soil of her fair rape Wip’d off in honourable keeping her. What treason were it to the ransack’d queen, Disgrace to your great worths, and shame to me, Now to deliver her possession up On terms of base compulsion! Can it be, That so degenerate a strain as this Should once set footing in your generous bosoms? There’s not the meanest spirit on our party Without a heart to dare or sword to draw When Helen is defended; nor none so noble Whose life were ill bestow’d or death unfam’d, Where Helen is the subject. Then, I say, Well may we fight for her whom we know well The world’s large spaces cannot parallel.  HECTOR. Paris and Troilus, you have both said well; And on the cause and question now in hand Have gloz’d, but superficially; not much Unlike young men, whom Aristotle thought Unfit to hear moral philosophy. The reasons you allege do more conduce To the hot passion of distemp’red blood Than to make up a free determination ’Twixt right and wrong; for pleasure and revenge Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice Of any true decision. Nature craves All dues be rend’red to their owners. Now, What nearer debt in all humanity Than wife is to the husband? If this law Of nature be corrupted through affection; And that great minds, of partial indulgence To their benumbed wills, resist the same; There is a law in each well-order’d nation To curb those raging appetites that are Most disobedient and refractory. If Helen, then, be wife to Sparta’s king— As it is known she is—these moral laws Of nature and of nations speak aloud To have her back return’d. Thus to persist In doing wrong extenuates not wrong, But makes it much more heavy. Hector’s opinion Is this, in way of truth. Yet, ne’ertheless, My spritely brethren, I propend to you In resolution to keep Helen still; For ’tis a cause that hath no mean dependence Upon our joint and several dignities.  TROILUS. Why, there you touch’d the life of our design. Were it not glory that we more affected Than the performance of our heaving spleens, I would not wish a drop of Trojan blood Spent more in her defence. But, worthy Hector, She is a theme of honour and renown, A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds, Whose present courage may beat down our foes, And fame in time to come canonize us; For I presume brave Hector would not lose So rich advantage of a promis’d glory As smiles upon the forehead of this action For the wide world’s revenue.  HECTOR. I am yours, You valiant offspring of great Priamus. I have a roisting challenge sent amongst The dull and factious nobles of the Greeks Will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits. I was advertis’d their great general slept, Whilst emulation in the army crept. This, I presume, will wake him.   [_Exeunt_.]  SCENE III. The Grecian camp. Before the tent of Achilles.   Enter Thersites, solus.  THERSITES. How now, Thersites! What, lost in the labyrinth of thy fury? Shall the elephant Ajax carry it thus? He beats me, and I rail at him. O worthy satisfaction! Would it were otherwise: that I could beat him, whilst he rail’d at me! ‘Sfoot, I’ll learn to conjure and raise devils, but I’ll see some issue of my spiteful execrations. Then there’s Achilles, a rare engineer! If Troy be not taken till these two undermine it, the walls will stand till they fall of themselves. O thou great thunder-darter of Olympus, forget that thou art Jove, the king of gods, and, Mercury, lose all the serpentine craft of thy caduceus, if ye take not that little little less than little wit from them that they have! which short-arm’d ignorance itself knows is so abundant scarce, it will not in circumvention deliver a fly from a spider without drawing their massy irons and cutting the web. After this, the vengeance on the whole camp! or, rather, the Neapolitan bone-ache! for that, methinks, is the curse depending on those that war for a placket. I have said my prayers; and devil Envy say ‘Amen.’ What ho! my Lord Achilles!   Enter Patroclus.  PATROCLUS. Who’s there? Thersites! Good Thersites, come in and rail.  THERSITES. If I could a’ rememb’red a gilt counterfeit, thou wouldst not have slipp’d out of my contemplation; but it is no matter; thyself upon thyself! The common curse of mankind, folly and ignorance, be thine in great revenue! Heaven bless thee from a tutor, and discipline come not near thee! Let thy blood be thy direction till thy death. Then if she that lays thee out says thou art a fair corse, I’ll be sworn and sworn upon’t she never shrouded any but lazars. Amen. Where’s Achilles?  PATROCLUS. What, art thou devout? Wast thou in prayer?  THERSITES. Ay, the heavens hear me!  PATROCLUS. Amen.   Enter Achilles.  ACHILLES. Who’s there?  PATROCLUS. Thersites, my lord.  ACHILLES. Where, where? O, where? Art thou come? Why, my cheese, my digestion, why hast thou not served thyself in to my table so many meals? Come, what’s Agamemnon?  THERSITES. Thy commander, Achilles. Then tell me, Patroclus, what’s Achilles?  PATROCLUS. Thy lord, Thersites. Then tell me, I pray thee, what’s Thersites?  THERSITES. Thy knower, Patroclus. Then tell me, Patroclus, what art thou?  PATROCLUS. Thou must tell that knowest.  ACHILLES. O, tell, tell,  THERSITES. I’ll decline the whole question. Agamemnon commands Achilles; Achilles is my lord; I am Patroclus’ knower; and Patroclus is a fool.  PATROCLUS. You rascal!  THERSITES. Peace, fool! I have not done.  ACHILLES. He is a privileg’d man. Proceed, Thersites.  THERSITES. Agamemnon is a fool; Achilles is a fool; Thersites is a fool; and, as aforesaid, Patroclus is a fool.  ACHILLES. Derive this; come.  THERSITES. Agamemnon is a fool to offer to command Achilles; Achilles is a fool to be commanded of Agamemnon; Thersites is a fool to serve such a fool; and this Patroclus is a fool positive.  PATROCLUS. Why am I a fool?  THERSITES. Make that demand of the Creator. It suffices me thou art. Look you, who comes here?   Enter Agamemnon, Ulysses, Nestor, Diomedes, Ajax and Calchas.  ACHILLES. Come, Patroclus, I’ll speak with nobody. Come in with me, Thersites.   [_Exit_.]  THERSITES. Here is such patchery, such juggling, and such knavery. All the argument is a whore and a cuckold—a good quarrel to draw emulous factions and bleed to death upon. Now the dry serpigo on the subject, and war and lechery confound all!   [_Exit_.]  AGAMEMNON. Where is Achilles?  PATROCLUS. Within his tent; but ill-dispos’d, my lord.  AGAMEMNON. Let it be known to him that we are here. He shent our messengers; and we lay by Our appertainings, visiting of him. Let him be told so; lest, perchance, he think We dare not move the question of our place Or know not what we are.  PATROCLUS. I shall say so to him.   [_Exit_.]  ULYSSES. We saw him at the opening of his tent. He is not sick.  AJAX. Yes, lion-sick, sick of proud heart. You may call it melancholy, if you will favour the man; but, by my head, ’tis pride. But why, why? Let him show us a cause. A word, my lord.   [_Takes Agamemnon aside_.]  NESTOR. What moves Ajax thus to bay at him?  ULYSSES. Achilles hath inveigled his fool from him.  NESTOR. Who, Thersites?  ULYSSES. He.  NESTOR. Then will Ajax lack matter, if he have lost his argument.  ULYSSES. No; you see he is his argument that has his argument, Achilles.  NESTOR. All the better; their fraction is more our wish than their faction. But it was a strong composure a fool could disunite!  ULYSSES. The amity that wisdom knits not, folly may easily untie.   Re-enter Patroclus.  Here comes Patroclus.  NESTOR. No Achilles with him.  ULYSSES. The elephant hath joints, but none for courtesy; his legs are legs for necessity, not for flexure.  PATROCLUS. Achilles bids me say he is much sorry If any thing more than your sport and pleasure Did move your greatness and this noble state To call upon him; he hopes it is no other But for your health and your digestion sake, An after-dinner’s breath.  AGAMEMNON. Hear you, Patroclus. We are too well acquainted with these answers; But his evasion, wing’d thus swift with scorn, Cannot outfly our apprehensions. Much attribute he hath, and much the reason Why we ascribe it to him. Yet all his virtues, Not virtuously on his own part beheld, Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss; Yea, like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish, Are like to rot untasted. Go and tell him We come to speak with him; and you shall not sin If you do say we think him over-proud And under-honest, in self-assumption greater Than in the note of judgement; and worthier than himself Here tend the savage strangeness he puts on, Disguise the holy strength of their command, And underwrite in an observing kind His humorous predominance; yea, watch His course and time, his ebbs and flows, as if The passage and whole stream of this commencement Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add That if he overhold his price so much We’ll none of him, but let him, like an engine Not portable, lie under this report: Bring action hither; this cannot go to war. A stirring dwarf we do allowance give Before a sleeping giant. Tell him so.  PATROCLUS. I shall, and bring his answer presently.   [_Exit_.]  AGAMEMNON. In second voice we’ll not be satisfied; We come to speak with him. Ulysses, enter you.   [_Exit_ Ulysses.]  AJAX. What is he more than another?  AGAMEMNON. No more than what he thinks he is.  AJAX. Is he so much? Do you not think he thinks himself a better man than I am?  AGAMEMNON. No question.  AJAX. Will you subscribe his thought and say he is?  AGAMEMNON. No, noble Ajax; you are as strong, as valiant, as wise, no less noble, much more gentle, and altogether more tractable.  AJAX. Why should a man be proud? How doth pride grow? I know not what pride is.  AGAMEMNON. Your mind is the clearer, Ajax, and your virtues the fairer. He that is proud eats up himself. Pride is his own glass, his own trumpet, his own chronicle; and whatever praises itself but in the deed devours the deed in the praise.   Re-enter Ulysses.  AJAX. I do hate a proud man as I do hate the engend’ring of toads.  NESTOR. [_Aside._] And yet he loves himself: is’t not strange?  ULYSSES. Achilles will not to the field tomorrow.  AGAMEMNON. What’s his excuse?  ULYSSES. He doth rely on none; But carries on the stream of his dispose, Without observance or respect of any, In will peculiar and in self-admission.  AGAMEMNON. Why will he not, upon our fair request, Untent his person and share th’air with us?  ULYSSES. Things small as nothing, for request’s sake only, He makes important; possess’d he is with greatness, And speaks not to himself but with a pride That quarrels at self-breath. Imagin’d worth Holds in his blood such swol’n and hot discourse That ’twixt his mental and his active parts Kingdom’d Achilles in commotion rages, And batters down himself. What should I say? He is so plaguy proud that the death tokens of it Cry ‘No recovery.’  AGAMEMNON. Let Ajax go to him. Dear lord, go you and greet him in his tent. ’Tis said he holds you well; and will be led At your request a little from himself.  ULYSSES. O Agamemnon, let it not be so! We’ll consecrate the steps that Ajax makes When they go from Achilles. Shall the proud lord That bastes his arrogance with his own seam And never suffers matter of the world Enter his thoughts, save such as doth revolve And ruminate himself—shall he be worshipp’d Of that we hold an idol more than he? No, this thrice worthy and right valiant lord Shall not so stale his palm, nobly acquir’d, Nor, by my will, assubjugate his merit, As amply titled as Achilles is, By going to Achilles. That were to enlard his fat-already pride, And add more coals to Cancer when he burns With entertaining great Hyperion. This lord go to him! Jupiter forbid, And say in thunder ‘Achilles go to him.’  NESTOR. [_Aside_.] O, this is well! He rubs the vein of him.  DIOMEDES. [_Aside_.] And how his silence drinks up this applause!  AJAX. If I go to him, with my armed fist I’ll pash him o’er the face.  AGAMEMNON. O, no, you shall not go.  AJAX. An a’ be proud with me I’ll pheeze his pride. Let me go to him.  ULYSSES. Not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel.  AJAX. A paltry, insolent fellow!  NESTOR. [_Aside_.] How he describes himself!  AJAX. Can he not be sociable?  ULYSSES. [_Aside_.] The raven chides blackness.  AJAX. I’ll let his humours blood.  AGAMEMNON. [_Aside_.] He will be the physician that should be the patient.  AJAX. And all men were o’ my mind—  ULYSSES. [_Aside_.] Wit would be out of fashion.  AJAX. A’ should not bear it so, a’ should eat’s words first. Shall pride carry it?  NESTOR. [_Aside_.] And ’twould, you’d carry half.  ULYSSES. [_Aside_.] A’ would have ten shares.  AJAX. I will knead him, I’ll make him supple.  NESTOR. [_Aside_.] He’s not yet through warm. Force him with praises; pour in, pour in; his ambition is dry.  ULYSSES. [_To Agamemnon_.] My lord, you feed too much on this dislike.  NESTOR. Our noble general, do not do so.  DIOMEDES. You must prepare to fight without Achilles.  ULYSSES. Why ’tis this naming of him does him harm. Here is a man—but ’tis before his face; I will be silent.  NESTOR. Wherefore should you so? He is not emulous, as Achilles is.  ULYSSES. Know the whole world, he is as valiant.  AJAX. A whoreson dog, that shall palter with us thus! Would he were a Trojan!  NESTOR. What a vice were it in Ajax now—  ULYSSES. If he were proud.  DIOMEDES. Or covetous of praise.  ULYSSES. Ay, or surly borne.  DIOMEDES. Or strange, or self-affected.  ULYSSES. Thank the heavens, lord, thou art of sweet composure. Praise him that gat thee, she that gave thee suck; Fam’d be thy tutor, and thy parts of nature Thrice fam’d beyond, beyond all erudition; But he that disciplin’d thine arms to fight— Let Mars divide eternity in twain And give him half; and, for thy vigour, Bull-bearing Milo his addition yield To sinewy Ajax. I will not praise thy wisdom, Which, like a bourn, a pale, a shore, confines Thy spacious and dilated parts. Here’s Nestor, Instructed by the antiquary times— He must, he is, he cannot but be wise; But pardon, father Nestor, were your days As green as Ajax’ and your brain so temper’d, You should not have the eminence of him, But be as Ajax.  AJAX. Shall I call you father?  NESTOR. Ay, my good son.  DIOMEDES. Be rul’d by him, Lord Ajax.  ULYSSES. There is no tarrying here; the hart Achilles Keeps thicket. Please it our great general To call together all his state of war; Fresh kings are come to Troy. Tomorrow We must with all our main of power stand fast; And here’s a lord—come knights from east to west And cull their flower, Ajax shall cope the best.  AGAMEMNON. Go we to council. Let Achilles sleep. Light boats sail swift, though greater hulks draw deep.   [_Exeunt_.]
  ACT III  SCENE I. Troy. Priam’s palace.
 Music sounds within. Enter Pandarus and a Servant.  PANDARUS. Friend, you—pray you, a word. Do you not follow the young Lord Paris?  SERVANT. Ay, sir, when he goes before me.  PANDARUS. You depend upon him, I mean?  SERVANT. Sir, I do depend upon the Lord.  PANDARUS. You depend upon a notable gentleman; I must needs praise him.  SERVANT. The Lord be praised!  PANDARUS. You know me, do you not?  SERVANT. Faith, sir, superficially.  PANDARUS. Friend, know me better: I am the Lord Pandarus.  SERVANT. I hope I shall know your honour better.  PANDARUS. I do desire it.  SERVANT. You are in the state of grace?  PANDARUS. Grace? Not so, friend; honour and lordship are my titles. What music is this?  SERVANT. I do but partly know, sir; it is music in parts.  PANDARUS. Know you the musicians?  SERVANT. Wholly, sir.  PANDARUS. Who play they to?  SERVANT. To the hearers, sir.  PANDARUS. At whose pleasure, friend?  SERVANT. At mine, sir, and theirs that love music.  PANDARUS. Command, I mean, friend.  SERVANT. Who shall I command, sir?  PANDARUS. Friend, we understand not one another: I am too courtly, and thou art too cunning. At whose request do these men play?  SERVANT. That’s to’t, indeed, sir. Marry, sir, at the request of Paris my lord, who is there in person; with him the mortal Venus, the heart-blood of beauty, love’s invisible soul—  PANDARUS. Who, my cousin, Cressida?  SERVANT. No, sir, Helen. Could not you find out that by her attributes?  PANDARUS. It should seem, fellow, that thou hast not seen the Lady Cressida. I come to speak with Paris from the Prince Troilus; I will make a complimental assault upon him, for my business seethes.  SERVANT. Sodden business! There’s a stew’d phrase indeed!   Enter Paris and Helen, attended.  PANDARUS. Fair be to you, my lord, and to all this fair company! Fair desires, in all fair measure, fairly guide them—especially to you, fair queen! Fair thoughts be your fair pillow.  HELEN. Dear lord, you are full of fair words.  PANDARUS. You speak your fair pleasure, sweet queen. Fair prince, here is good broken music.  PARIS. You have broke it, cousin; and by my life, you shall make it whole again; you shall piece it out with a piece of your performance.  HELEN. He is full of harmony.  PANDARUS. Truly, lady, no.  HELEN. O, sir—  PANDARUS. Rude, in sooth; in good sooth, very rude.  PARIS. Well said, my lord. Well, you say so in fits.  PANDARUS. I have business to my lord, dear queen. My lord, will you vouchsafe me a word?  HELEN. Nay, this shall not hedge us out. We’ll hear you sing, certainly—  PANDARUS. Well sweet queen, you are pleasant with me. But, marry, thus, my lord: my dear lord and most esteemed friend, your brother Troilus—  HELEN. My Lord Pandarus, honey-sweet lord—  PANDARUS. Go to, sweet queen, go to—commends himself most affectionately to you—  HELEN. You shall not bob us out of our melody. If you do, our melancholy upon your head!  PANDARUS. Sweet queen, sweet queen; that’s a sweet queen, i’ faith.  HELEN. And to make a sweet lady sad is a sour offence.  PANDARUS. Nay, that shall not serve your turn; that shall it not, in truth, la. Nay, I care not for such words; no, no.—And, my lord, he desires you that, if the King call for him at supper, you will make his excuse.  HELEN. My Lord Pandarus!  PANDARUS. What says my sweet queen, my very very sweet queen?  PARIS. What exploit’s in hand? Where sups he tonight?  HELEN. Nay, but, my lord—  PANDARUS. What says my sweet queen?—My cousin will fall out with you.  HELEN. You must not know where he sups.  PARIS. I’ll lay my life, with my disposer Cressida.  PANDARUS. No, no, no such matter; you are wide. Come, your disposer is sick.  PARIS. Well, I’ll make’s excuse.  PANDARUS. Ay, good my lord. Why should you say Cressida? No, your poor disposer’s sick.  PARIS. I spy.  PANDARUS. You spy! What do you spy?—Come, give me an instrument. Now, sweet queen.  HELEN. Why, this is kindly done.  PANDARUS. My niece is horribly in love with a thing you have, sweet queen.  HELEN. She shall have it, my lord, if it be not my Lord Paris.  PANDARUS. He? No, she’ll none of him; they two are twain.  HELEN. Falling in, after falling out, may make them three.  PANDARUS. Come, come. I’ll hear no more of this; I’ll sing you a song now.  HELEN. Ay, ay, prithee now. By my troth, sweet lord, thou hast a fine forehead.  PANDARUS. Ay, you may, you may.  HELEN. Let thy song be love. This love will undo us all. O Cupid, Cupid, Cupid!  PANDARUS. Love! Ay, that it shall, i’ faith.  PARIS. Ay, good now, love, love, nothing but love.  PANDARUS. In good troth, it begins so.   [_Sings_.]
  ACT IV  SCENE I. Troy. A street.
 Enter, at one side, Aeneas and servant with a torch; at another Paris,  Deiphobus, Antenor, Diomedes the Grecian, and others, with torches.  PARIS. See, ho! Who is that there?  DEIPHOBUS. It is the Lord Aeneas.  AENEAS. Is the Prince there in person? Had I so good occasion to lie long As you, Prince Paris, nothing but heavenly business Should rob my bed-mate of my company.  DIOMEDES. That’s my mind too. Good morrow, Lord Aeneas.  PARIS. A valiant Greek, Aeneas—take his hand: Witness the process of your speech, wherein You told how Diomed, a whole week by days, Did haunt you in the field.  AENEAS. Health to you, valiant sir, During all question of the gentle truce; But when I meet you arm’d, as black defiance As heart can think or courage execute.  DIOMEDES. The one and other Diomed embraces. Our bloods are now in calm; and so long health! But when contention and occasion meet, By Jove, I’ll play the hunter for thy life With all my force, pursuit, and policy.  AENEAS. And thou shalt hunt a lion that will fly With his face backward. In humane gentleness, Welcome to Troy! Now, by Anchises’ life, Welcome indeed! By Venus’ hand I swear No man alive can love in such a sort The thing he means to kill, more excellently.  DIOMEDES. We sympathise. Jove let Aeneas live, If to my sword his fate be not the glory, A thousand complete courses of the sun! But in mine emulous honour let him die With every joint a wound, and that tomorrow!  AENEAS. We know each other well.  DIOMEDES. We do; and long to know each other worse.  PARIS. This is the most despiteful gentle greeting, The noblest hateful love, that e’er I heard of. What business, lord, so early?  AENEAS. I was sent for to the King; but why, I know not.  PARIS. His purpose meets you: ’twas to bring this Greek To Calchas’ house, and there to render him, For the enfreed Antenor, the fair Cressid. Let’s have your company; or, if you please, Haste there before us. I constantly believe— Or rather call my thought a certain knowledge— My brother Troilus lodges there tonight. Rouse him and give him note of our approach, With the whole quality wherefore; I fear We shall be much unwelcome.  AENEAS. That I assure you: Troilus had rather Troy were borne to Greece Than Cressid borne from Troy.  PARIS. There is no help; The bitter disposition of the time Will have it so. On, lord; we’ll follow you.  AENEAS. Good morrow, all.   [_Exit with servant_.]  PARIS. And tell me, noble Diomed, faith, tell me true, Even in the soul of sound good-fellowship, Who in your thoughts deserves fair Helen best, Myself, or Menelaus?  DIOMEDES. Both alike: He merits well to have her that doth seek her, Not making any scruple of her soilure, With such a hell of pain and world of charge; And you as well to keep her that defend her, Not palating the taste of her dishonour, With such a costly loss of wealth and friends. He like a puling cuckold would drink up The lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece; You, like a lecher, out of whorish loins Are pleas’d to breed out your inheritors. Both merits pois’d, each weighs nor less nor more, But he as he, the heavier for a whore.  PARIS. You are too bitter to your country-woman.  DIOMEDES. She’s bitter to her country. Hear me, Paris: For every false drop in her bawdy veins A Grecian’s life hath sunk; for every scruple Of her contaminated carrion weight A Trojan hath been slain. Since she could speak, She hath not given so many good words breath As for her Greeks and Trojans suff’red death.  PARIS. Fair Diomed, you do as chapmen do, Dispraise the thing that you desire to buy; But we in silence hold this virtue well, We’ll not commend what we intend to sell. Here lies our way.   [_Exeunt_.]  SCENE II. Troy. The court of Pandarus’ house.   Enter Troilus and Cressida.  TROILUS. Dear, trouble not yourself; the morn is cold.  CRESSIDA. Then, sweet my lord, I’ll call mine uncle down; He shall unbolt the gates.  TROILUS. Trouble him not; To bed, to bed! Sleep kill those pretty eyes, And give as soft attachment to thy senses As infants empty of all thought!  CRESSIDA. Good morrow, then.  TROILUS. I prithee now, to bed.  CRESSIDA. Are you aweary of me?  TROILUS. O Cressida! but that the busy day, Wak’d by the lark, hath rous’d the ribald crows, And dreaming night will hide our joys no longer, I would not from thee.  CRESSIDA. Night hath been too brief.  TROILUS. Beshrew the witch! with venomous wights she stays As tediously as hell, but flies the grasps of love With wings more momentary-swift than thought. You will catch cold, and curse me.  CRESSIDA. Prithee tarry. You men will never tarry. O foolish Cressid! I might have still held off, And then you would have tarried. Hark! there’s one up.  PANDARUS. [_Within._] What’s all the doors open here?  TROILUS. It is your uncle.   Enter Pandarus.  CRESSIDA. A pestilence on him! Now will he be mocking. I shall have such a life!  PANDARUS. How now, how now! How go maidenheads? Here, you maid! Where’s my cousin Cressid?  CRESSIDA. Go hang yourself, you naughty mocking uncle. You bring me to do, and then you flout me too.  PANDARUS. To do what? to do what? Let her say what. What have I brought you to do?  CRESSIDA. Come, come, beshrew your heart! You’ll ne’er be good, nor suffer others.  PANDARUS. Ha, ha! Alas, poor wretch! Ah, poor capocchia! Hast not slept tonight? Would he not, a naughty man, let it sleep? A bugbear take him!  CRESSIDA. Did not I tell you? Would he were knock’d i’ th’ head!   [_One knocks_.]  Who’s that at door? Good uncle, go and see. My lord, come you again into my chamber. You smile and mock me, as if I meant naughtily.  TROILUS. Ha! ha!  CRESSIDA. Come, you are deceiv’d, I think of no such thing.   [_Knock_.]  How earnestly they knock! Pray you come in: I would not for half Troy have you seen here.   [_Exeunt Troilus and Cressida_.]  PANDARUS. Who’s there? What’s the matter? Will you beat down the door? How now? What’s the matter?   Enter Aeneas.  AENEAS. Good morrow, lord, good morrow.  PANDARUS. Who’s there? My lord Aeneas? By my troth, I knew you not. What news with you so early?  AENEAS. Is not Prince Troilus here?  PANDARUS. Here! What should he do here?  AENEAS. Come, he is here, my lord; do not deny him. It doth import him much to speak with me.  PANDARUS. Is he here, say you? It’s more than I know, I’ll be sworn. For my own part, I came in late. What should he do here?  AENEAS. Who, nay then! Come, come, you’ll do him wrong ere you are ware; you’ll be so true to him to be false to him. Do not you know of him, but yet go fetch him hither; go.   Re-enter Troilus.  TROILUS. How now! What’s the matter?  AENEAS. My lord, I scarce have leisure to salute you, My matter is so rash. There is at hand Paris your brother, and Deiphobus, The Grecian Diomed, and our Antenor Deliver’d to us; and for him forthwith, Ere the first sacrifice, within this hour, We must give up to Diomedes’ hand The Lady Cressida.  TROILUS. Is it so concluded?  AENEAS. By Priam and the general state of Troy. They are at hand, and ready to effect it.  TROILUS. How my achievements mock me! I will go meet them; and, my Lord Aeneas, We met by chance; you did not find me here.  AENEAS. Good, good, my lord, the secrets of neighbour Pandar Have not more gift in taciturnity.   [_Exeunt Troilus and Aeneas_.]  PANDARUS. Is’t possible? No sooner got but lost? The devil take Antenor! The young prince will go mad. A plague upon Antenor! I would they had broke’s neck.   Re-enter Cressida.  CRESSIDA. How now! What’s the matter? Who was here?  PANDARUS. Ah, ah!  CRESSIDA. Why sigh you so profoundly? Where’s my lord? Gone? Tell me, sweet uncle, what’s the matter?  PANDARUS. Would I were as deep under the earth as I am above!  CRESSIDA. O the gods! What’s the matter?  PANDARUS. Pray thee get thee in. Would thou hadst ne’er been born! I knew thou wouldst be his death! O, poor gentleman! A plague upon Antenor!  CRESSIDA. Good uncle, I beseech you, on my knees I beseech you, what’s the matter?  PANDARUS. Thou must be gone, wench, thou must be gone; thou art chang’d for Antenor; thou must to thy father, and be gone from Troilus. ’Twill be his death; ’twill be his bane; he cannot bear it.  CRESSIDA. O you immortal gods! I will not go.  PANDARUS. Thou must.  CRESSIDA. I will not, uncle. I have forgot my father; I know no touch of consanguinity, No kin, no love, no blood, no soul so near me As the sweet Troilus. O you gods divine, Make Cressid’s name the very crown of falsehood, If ever she leave Troilus! Time, force, and death, Do to this body what extremes you can, But the strong base and building of my love Is as the very centre of the earth, Drawing all things to it. I’ll go in and weep—  PANDARUS. Do, do.  CRESSIDA. Tear my bright hair, and scratch my praised cheeks, Crack my clear voice with sobs and break my heart, With sounding ‘Troilus.’ I will not go from Troy.   [_Exeunt_.]  SCENE III. Troy. A street before Pandarus’ house.   Enter Paris, Troilus, Aeneas, Deiphobus, Antenor and Diomedes.  PARIS. It is great morning; and the hour prefix’d For her delivery to this valiant Greek Comes fast upon. Good my brother Troilus, Tell you the lady what she is to do And haste her to the purpose.  TROILUS. Walk into her house. I’ll bring her to the Grecian presently; And to his hand when I deliver her, Think it an altar, and thy brother Troilus A priest, there off’ring to it his own heart.   [_Exit_.]  PARIS. I know what ’tis to love, And would, as I shall pity, I could help! Please you walk in, my lords?   [_Exeunt_.]  SCENE IV. Troy. Pandarus’ house.   Enter Pandarus and Cressida.  PANDARUS. Be moderate, be moderate.  CRESSIDA. Why tell you me of moderation? The grief is fine, full, perfect, that I taste, And violenteth in a sense as strong As that which causeth it. How can I moderate it? If I could temporize with my affections Or brew it to a weak and colder palate, The like allayment could I give my grief. My love admits no qualifying dross; No more my grief, in such a precious loss.   Enter Troilus.  PANDARUS. Here, here, here he comes. Ah, sweet ducks!  CRESSIDA. [_Embracing him_.] O Troilus! Troilus!  PANDARUS. What a pair of spectacles is here! Let me embrace too. ‘O heart,’ as the goodly saying is,—    O heart, heavy heart,   Why sigh’st thou without breaking?  where he answers again    Because thou canst not ease thy smart   By friendship nor by speaking.  There was never a truer rhyme. Let us cast away nothing, for we may live to have need of such a verse. We see it, we see it. How now, lambs!  TROILUS. Cressid, I love thee in so strain’d a purity That the bless’d gods, as angry with my fancy, More bright in zeal than the devotion which Cold lips blow to their deities, take thee from me.  CRESSIDA. Have the gods envy?  PANDARUS. Ay, ay, ay, ay; ’tis too plain a case.  CRESSIDA. And is it true that I must go from Troy?  TROILUS. A hateful truth.  CRESSIDA. What! and from Troilus too?  TROILUS. From Troy and Troilus.  CRESSIDA. Is’t possible?  TROILUS. And suddenly; where injury of chance Puts back leave-taking, justles roughly by All time of pause, rudely beguiles our lips Of all rejoindure, forcibly prevents Our lock’d embrasures, strangles our dear vows Even in the birth of our own labouring breath. We two, that with so many thousand sighs Did buy each other, must poorly sell ourselves With the rude brevity and discharge of one. Injurious time now with a robber’s haste Crams his rich thiev’ry up, he knows not how. As many farewells as be stars in heaven, With distinct breath and consign’d kisses to them, He fumbles up into a loose adieu, And scants us with a single famish’d kiss, Distasted with the salt of broken tears.  AENEAS. [_Within_.] My lord, is the lady ready?  TROILUS. Hark! you are call’d. Some say the Genius Cries so to him that instantly must die. Bid them have patience; she shall come anon.  PANDARUS. Where are my tears? Rain, to lay this wind, or my heart will be blown up by my throat!   [_Exit_.]  CRESSIDA. I must then to the Grecians?  TROILUS. No remedy.  CRESSIDA. A woeful Cressid ’mongst the merry Greeks! When shall we see again?  TROILUS. Hear me, my love. Be thou but true of heart.  CRESSIDA. I true? How now! What wicked deem is this?  TROILUS. Nay, we must use expostulation kindly, For it is parting from us. I speak not ‘Be thou true’ as fearing thee, For I will throw my glove to Death himself That there’s no maculation in thy heart; But ‘Be thou true’ say I to fashion in My sequent protestation: be thou true, And I will see thee.  CRESSIDA. O! you shall be expos’d, my lord, to dangers As infinite as imminent! But I’ll be true.  TROILUS. And I’ll grow friend with danger. Wear this sleeve.  CRESSIDA. And you this glove. When shall I see you?  TROILUS. I will corrupt the Grecian sentinels To give thee nightly visitation. But yet be true.  CRESSIDA. O heavens! ‘Be true’ again!  TROILUS. Hear why I speak it, love. The Grecian youths are full of quality; They’re loving, well compos’d, with gifts of nature, Flowing and swelling o’er with arts and exercise. How novelty may move, and parts with person, Alas, a kind of godly jealousy, Which, I beseech you, call a virtuous sin, Makes me afear’d.  CRESSIDA. O heavens! you love me not!  TROILUS. Die I a villain then! In this I do not call your faith in question So mainly as my merit. I cannot sing, Nor heel the high lavolt, nor sweeten talk, Nor play at subtle games; fair virtues all, To which the Grecians are most prompt and pregnant; But I can tell that in each grace of these There lurks a still and dumb-discoursive devil That tempts most cunningly. But be not tempted.  CRESSIDA. Do you think I will?  TROILUS. No. But something may be done that we will not; And sometimes we are devils to ourselves, When we will tempt the frailty of our powers, Presuming on their changeful potency.  AENEAS. [_Within_.] Nay, good my lord!  TROILUS. Come, kiss; and let us part.  PARIS. [_Within_.] Brother Troilus!  TROILUS. Good brother, come you hither; And bring Aeneas and the Grecian with you.  CRESSIDA. My lord, will you be true?  TROILUS. Who, I? Alas, it is my vice, my fault! Whiles others fish with craft for great opinion, I with great truth catch mere simplicity; Whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns, With truth and plainness I do wear mine bare. Fear not my truth: the moral of my wit Is plain and true; there’s all the reach of it.   Enter Aeneas, Paris, Antenor, Deiphobus and Diomedes.  Welcome, Sir Diomed! Here is the lady Which for Antenor we deliver you; At the port, lord, I’ll give her to thy hand, And by the way possess thee what she is. Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek, If e’er thou stand at mercy of my sword, Name Cressid, and thy life shall be as safe As Priam is in Ilion.  DIOMEDES. Fair Lady Cressid, So please you, save the thanks this prince expects. The lustre in your eye, heaven in your cheek, Pleads your fair usage; and to Diomed You shall be mistress, and command him wholly.  TROILUS. Grecian, thou dost not use me courteously To shame the zeal of my petition to thee In praising her. I tell thee, lord of Greece, She is as far high-soaring o’er thy praises As thou unworthy to be call’d her servant. I charge thee use her well, even for my charge; For, by the dreadful Pluto, if thou dost not, Though the great bulk Achilles be thy guard, I’ll cut thy throat.  DIOMEDES. O, be not mov’d, Prince Troilus. Let me be privileg’d by my place and message To be a speaker free: when I am hence I’ll answer to my lust. And know you, lord, I’ll nothing do on charge: to her own worth She shall be priz’d. But that you say ‘Be’t so,’ I speak it in my spirit and honour, ‘No.’  TROILUS. Come, to the port. I’ll tell thee, Diomed, This brave shall oft make thee to hide thy head. Lady, give me your hand; and, as we walk, To our own selves bend we our needful talk.   [_Exeunt Troilus, Cressida and Diomedes_.]   [_Sound trumpet_.]  PARIS. Hark! Hector’s trumpet.  AENEAS. How have we spent this morning! The Prince must think me tardy and remiss, That swore to ride before him to the field.  PARIS. ’Tis Troilus’ fault. Come, come to field with him.  DEIPHOBUS. Let us make ready straight.  AENEAS. Yea, with a bridegroom’s fresh alacrity Let us address to tend on Hector’s heels. The glory of our Troy doth this day lie On his fair worth and single chivalry.   [_Exeunt_.]  SCENE V. The Grecian camp. Lists set out.   Enter Ajax, armed; Agamemnon, Achilles, Patroclus, Menelaus, Ulysses,  Nestor and others.  AGAMEMNON. Here art thou in appointment fresh and fair, Anticipating time with starting courage. Give with thy trumpet a loud note to Troy, Thou dreadful Ajax, that the appalled air May pierce the head of the great combatant, And hale him hither.  AJAX. Thou, trumpet, there’s my purse. Now crack thy lungs and split thy brazen pipe; Blow, villain, till thy sphered bias cheek Out-swell the colic of puff’d Aquilon. Come, stretch thy chest, and let thy eyes spout blood: Thou blowest for Hector.   [_Trumpet sounds_.]  ULYSSES. No trumpet answers.  ACHILLES. ’Tis but early days.  AGAMEMNON. Is not yond Diomed, with Calchas’ daughter?  ULYSSES. ’Tis he, I ken the manner of his gait: He rises on the toe. That spirit of his In aspiration lifts him from the earth.   Enter Diomedes and Cressida.  AGAMEMNON. Is this the Lady Cressid?  DIOMEDES. Even she.  AGAMEMNON. Most dearly welcome to the Greeks, sweet lady.  NESTOR. Our general doth salute you with a kiss.  ULYSSES. Yet is the kindness but particular; ’Twere better she were kiss’d in general.  NESTOR. And very courtly counsel: I’ll begin. So much for Nestor.  ACHILLES. I’ll take that winter from your lips, fair lady. Achilles bids you welcome.  MENELAUS. I had good argument for kissing once.  PATROCLUS. But that’s no argument for kissing now; For thus popp’d Paris in his hardiment, And parted thus you and your argument.  ULYSSES. O deadly gall, and theme of all our scorns! For which we lose our heads to gild his horns.  PATROCLUS. The first was Menelaus’ kiss; this, mine: Patroclus kisses you.  MENELAUS. O, this is trim!  PATROCLUS. Paris and I kiss evermore for him.  MENELAUS. I’ll have my kiss, sir. Lady, by your leave.  CRESSIDA. In kissing, do you render or receive?  PATROCLUS. Both take and give.  CRESSIDA. I’ll make my match to live, The kiss you take is better than you give; Therefore no kiss.  MENELAUS. I’ll give you boot; I’ll give you three for one.  CRESSIDA. You are an odd man; give even or give none.  MENELAUS. An odd man, lady! Every man is odd.  CRESSIDA. No, Paris is not; for you know ’tis true That you are odd, and he is even with you.  MENELAUS. You fillip me o’ th’head.  CRESSIDA. No, I’ll be sworn.  ULYSSES. It were no match, your nail against his horn. May I, sweet lady, beg a kiss of you?  CRESSIDA. You may.  ULYSSES. I do desire it.  CRESSIDA. Why, beg then.  ULYSSES. Why then, for Venus’ sake give me a kiss When Helen is a maid again, and his.  CRESSIDA. I am your debtor; claim it when ’tis due.  ULYSSES. Never’s my day, and then a kiss of you.  DIOMEDES. Lady, a word. I’ll bring you to your father.   [_Exit with_ Cressida.]  NESTOR. A woman of quick sense.  ULYSSES. Fie, fie upon her! There’s language in her eye, her cheek, her lip, Nay, her foot speaks; her wanton spirits look out At every joint and motive of her body. O! these encounterers so glib of tongue That give a coasting welcome ere it comes, And wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts To every tickling reader! Set them down For sluttish spoils of opportunity, And daughters of the game.   [_Trumpet within_.]  ALL. The Trojans’ trumpet.  AGAMEMNON. Yonder comes the troop.   Enter Hector, armed; Aeneas, Troilus, Paris, Deiphobus and other Trojans, with attendants.  AENEAS. Hail, all you state of Greece! What shall be done To him that victory commands? Or do you purpose A victor shall be known? Will you the knights Shall to the edge of all extremity Pursue each other, or shall be divided By any voice or order of the field? Hector bade ask.  AGAMEMNON. Which way would Hector have it?  AENEAS. He cares not; he’ll obey conditions.  AGAMEMNON. ’Tis done like Hector.  ACHILLES. But securely done, A little proudly, and great deal misprising The knight oppos’d.  AENEAS. If not Achilles, sir, What is your name?  ACHILLES. If not Achilles, nothing.  AENEAS. Therefore Achilles. But whate’er, know this: In the extremity of great and little Valour and pride excel themselves in Hector; The one almost as infinite as all, The other blank as nothing. Weigh him well, And that which looks like pride is courtesy. This Ajax is half made of Hector’s blood; In love whereof half Hector stays at home; Half heart, half hand, half Hector comes to seek This blended knight, half Trojan and half Greek.  ACHILLES. A maiden battle then? O! I perceive you.   Re-enter Diomedes.  AGAMEMNON. Here is Sir Diomed. Go, gentle knight, Stand by our Ajax. As you and Lord Aeneas Consent upon the order of their fight, So be it; either to the uttermost, Or else a breath. The combatants being kin Half stints their strife before their strokes begin.  Ajax and Hector enter the lists.  ULYSSES. They are oppos’d already.  AGAMEMNON. What Trojan is that same that looks so heavy?  ULYSSES. The youngest son of Priam, a true knight; Not yet mature, yet matchless; firm of word; Speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue; Not soon provok’d, nor being provok’d soon calm’d; His heart and hand both open and both free; For what he has he gives, what thinks he shows, Yet gives he not till judgement guide his bounty, Nor dignifies an impure thought with breath; Manly as Hector, but more dangerous; For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes To tender objects, but he in heat of action Is more vindicative than jealous love. They call him Troilus, and on him erect A second hope as fairly built as Hector. Thus says Aeneas, one that knows the youth Even to his inches, and, with private soul, Did in great Ilion thus translate him to me.   [_Alarum. Hector and Ajax fight._]  AGAMEMNON. They are in action.  NESTOR. Now, Ajax, hold thine own!  TROILUS. Hector, thou sleep’st; awake thee!  AGAMEMNON. His blows are well dispos’d. There, Ajax!   [_Trumpets cease_.]  DIOMEDES. You must no more.  AENEAS. Princes, enough, so please you.  AJAX. I am not warm yet; let us fight again.  DIOMEDES. As Hector pleases.  HECTOR. Why, then will I no more. Thou art, great lord, my father’s sister’s son, A cousin-german to great Priam’s seed; The obligation of our blood forbids A gory emulation ’twixt us twain: Were thy commixtion Greek and Trojan so That thou could’st say ‘This hand is Grecian all, And this is Trojan; the sinews of this leg All Greek, and this all Troy; my mother’s blood Runs on the dexter cheek, and this sinister Bounds in my father’s; by Jove multipotent, Thou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish member Wherein my sword had not impressure made Of our rank feud; but the just gods gainsay That any drop thou borrow’dst from thy mother, My sacred aunt, should by my mortal sword Be drained! Let me embrace thee, Ajax. By him that thunders, thou hast lusty arms; Hector would have them fall upon him thus. Cousin, all honour to thee!  AJAX. I thank thee, Hector. Thou art too gentle and too free a man. I came to kill thee, cousin, and bear hence A great addition earned in thy death.  HECTOR. Not Neoptolemus so mirable, On whose bright crest Fame with her loud’st Oyes Cries ‘This is he!’ could promise to himself A thought of added honour torn from Hector.  AENEAS. There is expectance here from both the sides What further you will do.  HECTOR. We’ll answer it: The issue is embracement. Ajax, farewell.  AJAX. If I might in entreaties find success, As seld’ I have the chance, I would desire My famous cousin to our Grecian tents.  DIOMEDES. ’Tis Agamemnon’s wish; and great Achilles Doth long to see unarm’d the valiant Hector.  HECTOR. Aeneas, call my brother Troilus to me, And signify this loving interview To the expecters of our Trojan part; Desire them home. Give me thy hand, my cousin; I will go eat with thee, and see your knights.  Agamemnon and the rest of the Greeks come forward.  AJAX. Great Agamemnon comes to meet us here.  HECTOR. The worthiest of them tell me name by name; But for Achilles, my own searching eyes Shall find him by his large and portly size.  AGAMEMNON. Worthy all arms! as welcome as to one That would be rid of such an enemy. But that’s no welcome. Understand more clear, What’s past and what’s to come is strew’d with husks And formless ruin of oblivion; But in this extant moment, faith and troth, Strain’d purely from all hollow bias-drawing, Bids thee with most divine integrity, From heart of very heart, great Hector, welcome.  HECTOR. I thank thee, most imperious Agamemnon.  AGAMEMNON. [_To Troilus._] My well-fam’d lord of Troy, no less to you.  MENELAUS. Let me confirm my princely brother’s greeting. You brace of warlike brothers, welcome hither.  HECTOR. Who must we answer?  AENEAS. The noble Menelaus.  HECTOR. O you, my lord? By Mars his gauntlet, thanks! Mock not that I affect the untraded oath; Your quondam wife swears still by Venus’ glove. She’s well, but bade me not commend her to you.  MENELAUS. Name her not now, sir; she’s a deadly theme.  HECTOR. O, pardon; I offend.  NESTOR. I have, thou gallant Trojan, seen thee oft, Labouring for destiny, make cruel way Through ranks of Greekish youth; and I have seen thee, As hot as Perseus, spur thy Phrygian steed, Despising many forfeits and subduements, When thou hast hung thy advanced sword i’ th’air, Not letting it decline on the declined; That I have said to some my standers-by ‘Lo, Jupiter is yonder, dealing life!’ And I have seen thee pause and take thy breath, When that a ring of Greeks have shrap’d thee in, Like an Olympian wrestling. This have I seen; But this thy countenance, still lock’d in steel, I never saw till now. I knew thy grandsire, And once fought with him. He was a soldier good, But, by great Mars, the captain of us all, Never like thee. O, let an old man embrace thee; And, worthy warrior, welcome to our tents.  AENEAS. ’Tis the old Nestor.  HECTOR. Let me embrace thee, good old chronicle, That hast so long walk’d hand in hand with time. Most reverend Nestor, I am glad to clasp thee.  NESTOR. I would my arms could match thee in contention As they contend with thee in courtesy.  HECTOR. I would they could.  NESTOR. Ha! By this white beard, I’d fight with thee tomorrow. Well, welcome, welcome! I have seen the time.  ULYSSES. I wonder now how yonder city stands, When we have here her base and pillar by us.  HECTOR. I know your favour, Lord Ulysses, well. Ah, sir, there’s many a Greek and Trojan dead, Since first I saw yourself and Diomed In Ilion on your Greekish embassy.  ULYSSES. Sir, I foretold you then what would ensue. My prophecy is but half his journey yet; For yonder walls, that pertly front your town, Yon towers, whose wanton tops do buss the clouds, Must kiss their own feet.  HECTOR. I must not believe you. There they stand yet; and modestly I think The fall of every Phrygian stone will cost A drop of Grecian blood. The end crowns all; And that old common arbitrator, Time, Will one day end it.  ULYSSES. So to him we leave it. Most gentle and most valiant Hector, welcome. After the General, I beseech you next To feast with me and see me at my tent.  ACHILLES. I shall forestall thee, Lord Ulysses, thou! Now, Hector, I have fed mine eyes on thee; I have with exact view perus’d thee, Hector, And quoted joint by joint.  HECTOR. Is this Achilles?  ACHILLES. I am Achilles.  HECTOR. Stand fair, I pray thee; let me look on thee.  ACHILLES. Behold thy fill.  HECTOR. Nay, I have done already.  ACHILLES. Thou art too brief. I will the second time, As I would buy thee, view thee limb by limb.  HECTOR. O, like a book of sport thou’lt read me o’er; But there’s more in me than thou understand’st. Why dost thou so oppress me with thine eye?  ACHILLES. Tell me, you heavens, in which part of his body Shall I destroy him? Whether there, or there, or there? That I may give the local wound a name, And make distinct the very breach whereout Hector’s great spirit flew. Answer me, heavens.  HECTOR. It would discredit the blest gods, proud man, To answer such a question. Stand again. Think’st thou to catch my life so pleasantly As to prenominate in nice conjecture Where thou wilt hit me dead?  ACHILLES. I tell thee yea.  HECTOR. Wert thou an oracle to tell me so, I’d not believe thee. Henceforth guard thee well; For I’ll not kill thee there, nor there, nor there; But, by the forge that stithied Mars his helm, I’ll kill thee everywhere, yea, o’er and o’er. You wisest Grecians, pardon me this brag. His insolence draws folly from my lips; But I’ll endeavour deeds to match these words, Or may I never—  AJAX. Do not chafe thee, cousin; And you, Achilles, let these threats alone Till accident or purpose bring you to’t. You may have every day enough of Hector, If you have stomach. The general state, I fear, Can scarce entreat you to be odd with him.  HECTOR. I pray you let us see you in the field; We have had pelting wars since you refus’d The Grecians’ cause.  ACHILLES. Dost thou entreat me, Hector? Tomorrow do I meet thee, fell as death; Tonight all friends.  HECTOR. Thy hand upon that match.  AGAMEMNON. First, all you peers of Greece, go to my tent; There in the full convive we; afterwards, As Hector’s leisure and your bounties shall Concur together, severally entreat him. Beat loud the tambourines, let the trumpets blow, That this great soldier may his welcome know.   [_Exeunt all but Troilus and Ulysses_.]  TROILUS. My Lord Ulysses, tell me, I beseech you, In what place of the field doth Calchas keep?  ULYSSES. At Menelaus’ tent, most princely Troilus. There Diomed doth feast with him tonight, Who neither looks upon the heaven nor earth, But gives all gaze and bent of amorous view On the fair Cressid.  TROILUS. Shall I, sweet lord, be bound to you so much, After we part from Agamemnon’s tent, To bring me thither?  ULYSSES. You shall command me, sir. As gentle tell me of what honour was This Cressida in Troy? Had she no lover there That wails her absence?  TROILUS. O, sir, to such as boasting show their scars A mock is due. Will you walk on, my lord? She was belov’d, she lov’d; she is, and doth; But still sweet love is food for fortune’s tooth.   [_Exeunt_.]
  ACT V  SCENE I. The Grecian camp. Before the tent of Achilles.
 Enter Achilles and Patroclus.  ACHILLES. I’ll heat his blood with Greekish wine tonight, Which with my scimitar I’ll cool tomorrow. Patroclus, let us feast him to the height.  PATROCLUS. Here comes Thersites.   Enter Thersites.  ACHILLES. How now, thou core of envy! Thou crusty batch of nature, what’s the news?  THERSITES. Why, thou picture of what thou seemest, and idol of idiot worshippers, here’s a letter for thee.  ACHILLES. From whence, fragment?  THERSITES. Why, thou full dish of fool, from Troy.  PATROCLUS. Who keeps the tent now?  THERSITES. The surgeon’s box or the patient’s wound.  PATROCLUS. Well said, adversity! And what needs these tricks?  THERSITES. Prithee, be silent, boy; I profit not by thy talk; thou art said to be Achilles’ male varlet.  PATROCLUS. Male varlet, you rogue! What’s that?  THERSITES. Why, his masculine whore. Now, the rotten diseases of the south, the guts-griping ruptures, catarrhs, loads o’ gravel in the back, lethargies, cold palsies, raw eyes, dirt-rotten livers, wheezing lungs, bladders full of imposthume, sciaticas, lime-kilns i’ th’ palm, incurable bone-ache, and the rivelled fee-simple of the tetter, take and take again such preposterous discoveries!  PATROCLUS. Why, thou damnable box of envy, thou, what meanest thou to curse thus?  THERSITES. Do I curse thee?  PATROCLUS. Why, no, you ruinous butt; you whoreson indistinguishable cur, no.  THERSITES. No! Why art thou, then, exasperate, thou idle immaterial skein of sleave silk, thou green sarcenet flap for a sore eye, thou tassel of a prodigal’s purse, thou? Ah, how the poor world is  pestered with such water-flies, diminutives of nature!  PATROCLUS. Out, gall!  THERSITES. Finch egg!  ACHILLES. My sweet Patroclus, I am thwarted quite From my great purpose in tomorrow’s battle. Here is a letter from Queen Hecuba, A token from her daughter, my fair love, Both taxing me and gaging me to keep An oath that I have sworn. I will not break it. Fall Greeks; fail fame; honour or go or stay; My major vow lies here, this I’ll obey. Come, come, Thersites, help to trim my tent; This night in banqueting must all be spent. Away, Patroclus!   [_Exit with_ Patroclus.]  THERSITES. With too much blood and too little brain these two may run mad; but, if with too much brain and too little blood they do, I’ll be a curer of madmen. Here’s Agamemnon, an honest fellow enough, and one that loves quails, but he has not so much brain as ear-wax; and the goodly transformation of Jupiter there, his brother, the bull, the primitive statue and oblique memorial of cuckolds, a thrifty shoeing-horn in a chain at his brother’s leg, to what form but that he is, should wit larded with malice, and malice forced with wit, turn him to? To an ass, were nothing: he is both ass and ox. To an ox, were nothing: he is both ox and ass. To be a dog, a mule, a cat, a fitchook, a toad, a lizard, an owl, a puttock, or a herring without a roe, I would not care; but to be Menelaus, I would conspire against destiny. Ask me not what I would be, if I were not Thersites; for I care not to be the louse of a lazar, so I were not Menelaus. Hey-day! sprites and fires!   Enter Hector, Troilus, Ajax, Agamemnon, Ulysses, Nestor, Menelaus and  Diomedes with lights.  AGAMEMNON. We go wrong, we go wrong.  AJAX. No, yonder ’tis; There, where we see the lights.  HECTOR. I trouble you.  AJAX. No, not a whit.  ULYSSES. Here comes himself to guide you.   Re-enter Achilles.  ACHILLES. Welcome, brave Hector; welcome, Princes all.  AGAMEMNON. So now, fair Prince of Troy, I bid good night; Ajax commands the guard to tend on you.  HECTOR. Thanks, and good night to the Greeks’ general.  MENELAUS. Good night, my lord.  HECTOR. Good night, sweet Lord Menelaus.  THERSITES. Sweet draught! ‘Sweet’ quoth a’! Sweet sink, sweet sewer!  ACHILLES. Good night and welcome, both at once, to those That go or tarry.  AGAMEMNON. Good night.   [_Exeunt Agamemnon and Menelaus_.]  ACHILLES. Old Nestor tarries; and you too, Diomed, Keep Hector company an hour or two.  DIOMEDES. I cannot, lord; I have important business, The tide whereof is now. Good night, great Hector.  HECTOR. Give me your hand.  ULYSSES. [_Aside to Troilus._] Follow his torch; he goes to Calchas’ tent; I’ll keep you company.  TROILUS. Sweet sir, you honour me.  HECTOR. And so, good night.   [_Exit Diomedes, Ulysses and Troilus following._]  ACHILLES. Come, come, enter my tent.   [_Exeunt all but_ Thersites.]  THERSITES. That same Diomed’s a false-hearted rogue, a most unjust knave; I will no more trust him when he leers than I will a serpent when he hisses. He will spend his mouth and promise, like Brabbler the hound; but when he performs, astronomers foretell it: it is prodigious, there will come some change; the sun borrows of the moon when Diomed keeps his word. I will rather leave to see Hector than not to dog him. They say he keeps a Trojan drab, and uses the traitor Calchas’ tent. I’ll after. Nothing but lechery! All incontinent varlets!   [_Exit_.]  SCENE II. The Grecian camp. Before Calchas’ tent.   Enter Diomedes.  DIOMEDES. What, are you up here, ho! Speak.  CALCHAS. [_Within_.] Who calls?  DIOMEDES. Diomed. Calchas, I think. Where’s your daughter?  CALCHAS. [_Within_.] She comes to you.   Enter Troilus and Ulysses, at a distance; after them Thersites.  ULYSSES. Stand where the torch may not discover us.   Enter Cressida.  TROILUS. Cressid comes forth to him.  DIOMEDES. How now, my charge!  CRESSIDA. Now, my sweet guardian! Hark, a word with you.   [_Whispers_.]  TROILUS. Yea, so familiar?  ULYSSES. She will sing any man at first sight.  THERSITES. And any man may sing her, if he can take her cliff; she’s noted.  DIOMEDES. Will you remember?  CRESSIDA. Remember! Yes.  DIOMEDES. Nay, but do, then; And let your mind be coupled with your words.  TROILUS. What should she remember?  ULYSSES. List!  CRESSIDA. Sweet honey Greek, tempt me no more to folly.  THERSITES. Roguery!  DIOMEDES. Nay, then—  CRESSIDA. I’ll tell you what—  DIOMEDES. Fo, fo! come, tell a pin; you are a forsworn.  CRESSIDA. In faith, I cannot. What would you have me do?  THERSITES. A juggling trick, to be secretly open.  DIOMEDES. What did you swear you would bestow on me?  CRESSIDA. I prithee, do not hold me to mine oath; Bid me do anything but that, sweet Greek.  DIOMEDES. Good night.  TROILUS. Hold, patience!  ULYSSES. How now, Trojan!  CRESSIDA. Diomed!  DIOMEDES. No, no, good night; I’ll be your fool no more.  TROILUS. Thy better must.  CRESSIDA. Hark! a word in your ear.  TROILUS. O plague and madness!  ULYSSES. You are moved, Prince; let us depart, I pray, Lest your displeasure should enlarge itself To wrathful terms. This place is dangerous; The time right deadly; I beseech you, go.  TROILUS. Behold, I pray you.  ULYSSES. Nay, good my lord, go off; You flow to great distraction; come, my lord.  TROILUS. I pray thee stay.  ULYSSES. You have not patience; come.  TROILUS. I pray you, stay; by hell and all hell’s torments, I will not speak a word.  DIOMEDES. And so, good night.  CRESSIDA. Nay, but you part in anger.  TROILUS. Doth that grieve thee? O withered truth!  ULYSSES. How now, my lord?  TROILUS. By Jove, I will be patient.  CRESSIDA. Guardian! Why, Greek!  DIOMEDES. Fo, fo! adieu! you palter.  CRESSIDA. In faith, I do not. Come hither once again.  ULYSSES. You shake, my lord, at something; will you go? You will break out.  TROILUS. She strokes his cheek.  ULYSSES. Come, come.  TROILUS. Nay, stay; by Jove, I will not speak a word: There is between my will and all offences A guard of patience. Stay a little while.  THERSITES. How the devil Luxury, with his fat rump and potato finger, tickles these together! Fry, lechery, fry!  DIOMEDES. But will you, then?  CRESSIDA. In faith, I will, la; never trust me else.  DIOMEDES. Give me some token for the surety of it.  CRESSIDA. I’ll fetch you one.   [_Exit_.]  ULYSSES. You have sworn patience.  TROILUS. Fear me not, my lord; I will not be myself, nor have cognition Of what I feel. I am all patience.   Re-enter Cressida.  THERSITES. Now the pledge; now, now, now!  CRESSIDA. Here, Diomed, keep this sleeve.  TROILUS. O beauty! where is thy faith?  ULYSSES. My lord!  TROILUS. I will be patient; outwardly I will.  CRESSIDA. You look upon that sleeve; behold it well. He lov’d me—O false wench!—Give’t me again.  DIOMEDES. Whose was’t?  CRESSIDA. It is no matter, now I have’t again. I will not meet with you tomorrow night. I prithee, Diomed, visit me no more.  THERSITES. Now she sharpens. Well said, whetstone.  DIOMEDES. I shall have it.  CRESSIDA. What, this?  DIOMEDES. Ay, that.  CRESSIDA. O all you gods! O pretty, pretty pledge! Thy master now lies thinking on his bed Of thee and me, and sighs, and takes my glove, And gives memorial dainty kisses to it, As I kiss thee. Nay, do not snatch it from me; He that takes that doth take my heart withal.  DIOMEDES. I had your heart before; this follows it.  TROILUS. I did swear patience.  CRESSIDA. You shall not have it, Diomed; faith, you shall not; I’ll give you something else.  DIOMEDES. I will have this. Whose was it?  CRESSIDA. It is no matter.  DIOMEDES. Come, tell me whose it was.  CRESSIDA. ’Twas one’s that lov’d me better than you will. But, now you have it, take it.  DIOMEDES. Whose was it?  CRESSIDA. By all Diana’s waiting women yond, And by herself, I will not tell you whose.  DIOMEDES. Tomorrow will I wear it on my helm, And grieve his spirit that dares not challenge it.  TROILUS. Wert thou the devil and wor’st it on thy horn, It should be challeng’d.  CRESSIDA. Well, well, ’tis done, ’tis past; and yet it is not; I will not keep my word.  DIOMEDES. Why, then farewell; Thou never shalt mock Diomed again.  CRESSIDA. You shall not go. One cannot speak a word But it straight starts you.  DIOMEDES. I do not like this fooling.  THERSITES. Nor I, by Pluto; but that that likes not you Pleases me best.  DIOMEDES. What, shall I come? The hour?  CRESSIDA. Ay, come; O Jove! Do come. I shall be plagu’d.  DIOMEDES. Farewell till then.  CRESSIDA. Good night. I prithee come.   [_Exit_ Diomedes.]  Troilus, farewell! One eye yet looks on thee; But with my heart the other eye doth see. Ah, poor our sex! this fault in us I find, The error of our eye directs our mind. What error leads must err; O, then conclude, Minds sway’d by eyes are full of turpitude.   [_Exit_.]  THERSITES. A proof of strength she could not publish more, Unless she said ‘My mind is now turn’d whore.’  ULYSSES. All’s done, my lord.  TROILUS. It is.  ULYSSES. Why stay we, then?  TROILUS. To make a recordation to my soul Of every syllable that here was spoke. But if I tell how these two did co-act, Shall I not lie in publishing a truth? Sith yet there is a credence in my heart, An esperance so obstinately strong, That doth invert th’attest of eyes and ears; As if those organs had deceptious functions Created only to calumniate. Was Cressid here?  ULYSSES. I cannot conjure, Trojan.  TROILUS. She was not, sure.  ULYSSES. Most sure she was.  TROILUS. Why, my negation hath no taste of madness.  ULYSSES. Nor mine, my lord. Cressid was here but now.  TROILUS. Let it not be believ’d for womanhood. Think, we had mothers; do not give advantage To stubborn critics, apt, without a theme, For depravation, to square the general sex By Cressid’s rule. Rather think this not Cressid.  ULYSSES. What hath she done, Prince, that can soil our mothers?  TROILUS. Nothing at all, unless that this were she.  THERSITES. Will he swagger himself out on’s own eyes?  TROILUS. This she? No; this is Diomed’s Cressida. If beauty have a soul, this is not she; If souls guide vows, if vows be sanctimonies, If sanctimony be the god’s delight, If there be rule in unity itself, This was not she. O madness of discourse, That cause sets up with and against itself! Bi-fold authority! where reason can revolt Without perdition, and loss assume all reason Without revolt: this is, and is not, Cressid. Within my soul there doth conduce a fight Of this strange nature, that a thing inseparate Divides more wider than the sky and earth; And yet the spacious breadth of this division Admits no orifice for a point as subtle As Ariachne’s broken woof to enter. Instance, O instance! strong as Pluto’s gates: Cressid is mine, tied with the bonds of heaven. Instance, O instance! strong as heaven itself: The bonds of heaven are slipp’d, dissolv’d, and loos’d; And with another knot, five-finger-tied, The fractions of her faith, orts of her love, The fragments, scraps, the bits, and greasy relics Of her o’er-eaten faith, are given to Diomed.  ULYSSES. May worthy Troilus be half attach’d With that which here his passion doth express?  TROILUS. Ay, Greek; and that shall be divulged well In characters as red as Mars his heart Inflam’d with Venus. Never did young man fancy With so eternal and so fix’d a soul. Hark, Greek: as much as I do Cressid love, So much by weight hate I her Diomed. That sleeve is mine that he’ll bear on his helm; Were it a casque compos’d by Vulcan’s skill My sword should bite it. Not the dreadful spout Which shipmen do the hurricano call, Constring’d in mass by the almighty sun, Shall dizzy with more clamour Neptune’s ear In his descent than shall my prompted sword Falling on Diomed.  THERSITES. He’ll tickle it for his concupy.  TROILUS. O Cressid! O false Cressid! false, false, false! Let all untruths stand by thy stained name, And they’ll seem glorious.  ULYSSES. O, contain yourself; Your passion draws ears hither.   Enter Aeneas.  AENEAS. I have been seeking you this hour, my lord. Hector, by this, is arming him in Troy; Ajax, your guard, stays to conduct you home.  TROILUS. Have with you, Prince. My courteous lord, adieu. Fairwell, revolted fair! and, Diomed, Stand fast, and wear a castle on thy head.  ULYSSES. I’ll bring you to the gates.  TROILUS. Accept distracted thanks.   [_Exeunt Troilus, Aeneas and Ulysses_.]  THERSITES. Would I could meet that rogue Diomed! I would croak like a raven; I would bode, I would bode. Patroclus will give me anything for the intelligence of this whore; the parrot will not do more for an almond than he for a commodious drab. Lechery, lechery! Still wars and lechery! Nothing else holds fashion. A burning devil take them!   [_Exit_.]  SCENE III. Troy. Before Priam’s palace.   Enter Hector and Andromache.  ANDROMACHE. When was my lord so much ungently temper’d To stop his ears against admonishment? Unarm, unarm, and do not fight today.  HECTOR. You train me to offend you; get you in. By all the everlasting gods, I’ll go.  ANDROMACHE. My dreams will, sure, prove ominous to the day.  HECTOR. No more, I say.   Enter Cassandra.  CASSANDRA. Where is my brother Hector?  ANDROMACHE. Here, sister, arm’d, and bloody in intent. Consort with me in loud and dear petition, Pursue we him on knees; for I have dreamt Of bloody turbulence, and this whole night Hath nothing been but shapes and forms of slaughter.  CASSANDRA. O, ’tis true!  HECTOR. Ho! bid my trumpet sound.  CASSANDRA. No notes of sally, for the heavens, sweet brother!  HECTOR. Be gone, I say. The gods have heard me swear.  CASSANDRA. The gods are deaf to hot and peevish vows; They are polluted off’rings, more abhorr’d Than spotted livers in the sacrifice.  ANDROMACHE. O, be persuaded! Do not count it holy To hurt by being just. It is as lawful, For we would give much, to use violent thefts And rob in the behalf of charity.  CASSANDRA. It is the purpose that makes strong the vow; But vows to every purpose must not hold. Unarm, sweet Hector.  HECTOR. Hold you still, I say. Mine honour keeps the weather of my fate. Life every man holds dear; but the dear man Holds honour far more precious dear than life.   Enter Troilus.  How now, young man! Mean’st thou to fight today?  ANDROMACHE. Cassandra, call my father to persuade.   [_Exit_ Cassandra.]  HECTOR. No, faith, young Troilus; doff thy harness, youth; I am today i’ th’vein of chivalry. Let grow thy sinews till their knots be strong, And tempt not yet the brushes of the war. Unarm thee, go; and doubt thou not, brave boy, I’ll stand today for thee and me and Troy.  TROILUS. Brother, you have a vice of mercy in you, Which better fits a lion than a man.  HECTOR. What vice is that? Good Troilus, chide me for it.  TROILUS. When many times the captive Grecian falls, Even in the fan and wind of your fair sword, You bid them rise and live.  HECTOR. O, ’tis fair play!  TROILUS. Fool’s play, by heaven, Hector.  HECTOR. How now? how now?  TROILUS. For th’ love of all the gods, Let’s leave the hermit Pity with our mother; And when we have our armours buckled on, The venom’d vengeance ride upon our swords, Spur them to ruthful work, rein them from ruth!  HECTOR. Fie, savage, fie!  TROILUS. Hector, then ’tis wars.  HECTOR. Troilus, I would not have you fight today.  TROILUS. Who should withhold me? Not fate, obedience, nor the hand of Mars Beckoning with fiery truncheon my retire; Not Priamus and Hecuba on knees, Their eyes o’er-galled with recourse of tears; Nor you, my brother, with your true sword drawn, Oppos’d to hinder me, should stop my way, But by my ruin.   Re-enter Cassandra with Priam.  CASSANDRA. Lay hold upon him, Priam, hold him fast; He is thy crutch; now if thou lose thy stay, Thou on him leaning, and all Troy on thee, Fall all together.  PRIAM. Come, Hector, come, go back. Thy wife hath dreamt; thy mother hath had visions; Cassandra doth foresee; and I myself Am like a prophet suddenly enrapt To tell thee that this day is ominous. Therefore, come back.  HECTOR. Aeneas is a-field; And I do stand engag’d to many Greeks, Even in the faith of valour, to appear This morning to them.  PRIAM. Ay, but thou shalt not go.  HECTOR. I must not break my faith. You know me dutiful; therefore, dear sir, Let me not shame respect; but give me leave To take that course by your consent and voice Which you do here forbid me, royal Priam.  CASSANDRA. O Priam, yield not to him!  ANDROMACHE. Do not, dear father.  HECTOR. Andromache, I am offended with you. Upon the love you bear me, get you in.   [_Exit_ Andromache.]  TROILUS. This foolish, dreaming, superstitious girl Makes all these bodements.  CASSANDRA. O, farewell, dear Hector! Look how thou diest. Look how thy eye turns pale. Look how thy wounds do bleed at many vents. Hark how Troy roars; how Hecuba cries out; How poor Andromache shrills her dolours forth; Behold distraction, frenzy, and amazement, Like witless antics, one another meet, And all cry, ‘Hector! Hector’s dead! O Hector!’  TROILUS. Away, away!  CASSANDRA. Farewell! yet, soft! Hector, I take my leave. Thou dost thyself and all our Troy deceive.   [_Exit_.]  HECTOR. You are amaz’d, my liege, at her exclaim. Go in, and cheer the town; we’ll forth, and fight, Do deeds worth praise and tell you them at night.  PRIAM. Farewell. The gods with safety stand about thee!   [_Exeunt severally Priam and Hector. Alarums._]  TROILUS. They are at it, hark! Proud Diomed, believe, I come to lose my arm or win my sleeve.   Enter Pandarus.  PANDARUS. Do you hear, my lord? Do you hear?  TROILUS. What now?  PANDARUS. Here’s a letter come from yond poor girl.  TROILUS. Let me read.  PANDARUS. A whoreson tisick, a whoreson rascally tisick, so troubles me, and the foolish fortune of this girl, and what one thing, what another, that I shall leave you one o’ these days; and I have a rheum in mine eyes too, and such an ache in my bones that unless a man were curs’d I cannot tell what to think on’t. What says she there?  TROILUS. Words, words, mere words, no matter from the heart; Th’effect doth operate another way.   [_Tearing the letter_.]  Go, wind, to wind, there turn and change together. My love with words and errors still she feeds, But edifies another with her deeds.   [_Exeunt severally_.]  SCENE IV. The plain between Troy and the Grecian camp.   Alarums. Excursions. Enter Thersites.  THERSITES. Now they are clapper-clawing one another; I’ll go look on. That dissembling abominable varlet, Diomed, has got that same scurvy doting foolish young knave’s sleeve of Troy there in his helm. I would fain see them meet, that that same young Trojan ass that loves the whore there might send that Greekish whoremasterly villain with the sleeve back to the dissembling luxurious drab of a sleeve-less errand. O’ the other side, the policy of those crafty swearing rascals that stale old mouse-eaten dry cheese, Nestor, and that same dog-fox, Ulysses, is not prov’d worth a blackberry. They set me up, in policy, that mongrel cur, Ajax, against that dog of as bad a kind, Achilles; and now is the cur, Ajax prouder than the cur Achilles, and will not arm today; whereupon the Grecians begin to proclaim barbarism, and policy grows into an ill opinion.   Enter Diomedes, Troilus following.  Soft! here comes sleeve, and t’other.  TROILUS. Fly not; for shouldst thou take the river Styx, I would swim after.  DIOMEDES. Thou dost miscall retire. I do not fly; but advantageous care Withdrew me from the odds of multitude. Have at thee!  THERSITES. Hold thy whore, Grecian; now for thy whore, Trojan! now the sleeve, now the sleeve!   [_Exeunt Troilus and Diomedes fighting_.]   Enter Hector.  HECTOR. What art thou, Greek? Art thou for Hector’s match? Art thou of blood and honour?  THERSITES. No, no I am a rascal; a scurvy railing knave; a very filthy rogue.  HECTOR. I do believe thee. Live.   [_Exit_.]  THERSITES. God-a-mercy, that thou wilt believe me; but a plague break thy neck for frighting me! What’s become of the wenching rogues? I think they have swallowed one another. I would laugh at that miracle. Yet, in a sort, lechery eats itself. I’ll seek them.   [_Exit_.]  SCENE V. Another part of the plain.   Enter Diomedes and a Servant.  DIOMEDES. Go, go, my servant, take thou Troilus’ horse; Present the fair steed to my lady Cressid. Fellow, commend my service to her beauty; Tell her I have chastis’d the amorous Trojan, And am her knight by proof.  SERVANT. I go, my lord.   [_Exit_.]   Enter Agamemnon.  AGAMEMNON. Renew, renew! The fierce Polydamas Hath beat down Menon; bastard Margarelon Hath Doreus prisoner, And stands colossus-wise, waving his beam, Upon the pashed corses of the kings Epistrophus and Cedius. Polixenes is slain; Amphimacus and Thoas deadly hurt; Patroclus ta’en, or slain; and Palamedes Sore hurt and bruis’d. The dreadful Sagittary Appals our numbers. Haste we, Diomed, To reinforcement, or we perish all.   Enter Nestor.  NESTOR. Go, bear Patroclus’ body to Achilles, And bid the snail-pac’d Ajax arm for shame. There is a thousand Hectors in the field; Now here he fights on Galathe his horse, And there lacks work; anon he’s there afoot, And there they fly or die, like scaled sculls Before the belching whale; then is he yonder, And there the strawy Greeks, ripe for his edge, Fall down before him like the mower’s swath. Here, there, and everywhere, he leaves and takes; Dexterity so obeying appetite That what he will he does, and does so much That proof is call’d impossibility.   Enter Ulysses.  ULYSSES. O, courage, courage, courage, Princes! Great Achilles Is arming, weeping, cursing, vowing vengeance. Patroclus’ wounds have rous’d his drowsy blood, Together with his mangled Myrmidons, That noseless, handless, hack’d and chipp’d, come to him, Crying on Hector. Ajax hath lost a friend And foams at mouth, and he is arm’d and at it, Roaring for Troilus; who hath done today Mad and fantastic execution, Engaging and redeeming of himself With such a careless force and forceless care As if that lust, in very spite of cunning, Bade him win all.   Enter Ajax.  AJAX. Troilus! thou coward Troilus!   [_Exit_.]  DIOMEDES. Ay, there, there.  NESTOR. So, so, we draw together.   [_Exit_.]   Enter Achilles.  ACHILLES. Where is this Hector? Come, come, thou boy-queller, show thy face; Know what it is to meet Achilles angry. Hector! where’s Hector? I will none but Hector.   [_Exeunt_.]  SCENE VI. Another part of the plain.   Enter Ajax.  AJAX. Troilus, thou coward Troilus, show thy head.   Enter Diomedes.  DIOMEDES. Troilus, I say! Where’s Troilus?  AJAX. What wouldst thou?  DIOMEDES. I would correct him.  AJAX. Were I the general, thou shouldst have my office Ere that correction. Troilus, I say! What, Troilus!   Enter Troilus.  TROILUS. O traitor Diomed! Turn thy false face, thou traitor, And pay thy life thou owest me for my horse.  DIOMEDES. Ha! art thou there?  AJAX. I’ll fight with him alone. Stand, Diomed.  DIOMEDES. He is my prize. I will not look upon.  TROILUS. Come, both, you cogging Greeks; have at you both!   [_Exeunt fighting_.]   Enter Hector.  HECTOR. Yea, Troilus? O, well fought, my youngest brother!   Enter Achilles.  ACHILLES. Now do I see thee. Ha! have at thee, Hector!  HECTOR. Pause, if thou wilt.  ACHILLES. I do disdain thy courtesy, proud Trojan. Be happy that my arms are out of use; My rest and negligence befriend thee now, But thou anon shalt hear of me again; Till when, go seek thy fortune.   [_Exit_.]  HECTOR. Fare thee well. I would have been much more a fresher man, Had I expected thee.   Re-enter Troilus.  How now, my brother!  TROILUS. Ajax hath ta’en Aeneas. Shall it be? No, by the flame of yonder glorious heaven, He shall not carry him; I’ll be ta’en too, Or bring him off. Fate, hear me what I say: I reck not though thou end my life today.   [_Exit_.]   Enter one in armour.  HECTOR. Stand, stand, thou Greek; thou art a goodly mark. No? wilt thou not? I like thy armour well; I’ll frush it and unlock the rivets all But I’ll be master of it. Wilt thou not, beast, abide? Why then, fly on; I’ll hunt thee for thy hide.   [_Exeunt_.]  SCENE VII. Another part of the plain.   Enter Achilles with Myrmidons.  ACHILLES. Come here about me, you my Myrmidons; Mark what I say. Attend me where I wheel; Strike not a stroke, but keep yourselves in breath; And when I have the bloody Hector found, Empale him with your weapons round about; In fellest manner execute your arms. Follow me, sirs, and my proceedings eye. It is decreed Hector the great must die.   [_Exeunt_.]   Enter Menelaus and Paris, fighting; then Thersites.  THERSITES. The cuckold and the cuckold-maker are at it. Now, bull! Now, dog! ’Loo, Paris, ’loo! now my double-hen’d Spartan! ’loo, Paris, ’loo! The bull has the game. ’Ware horns, ho!   [_Exeunt Paris and Menelaus_.]   Enter Margarelon.  MARGARELON. Turn, slave, and fight.  THERSITES. What art thou?  MARGARELON. A bastard son of Priam’s.  THERSITES. I am a bastard too; I love bastards. I am a bastard begot, bastard instructed, bastard in mind, bastard in valour, in everything illegitimate. One bear will not bite another, and wherefore should one bastard? Take heed, the quarrel’s most ominous to us: if the son of a whore fight for a whore, he tempts judgement. Farewell, bastard.   [_Exit_.]  MARGARELON. The devil take thee, coward!   [_Exit_.]  SCENE VIII. Another part of the plain.   Enter Hector.  HECTOR. Most putrified core so fair without, Thy goodly armour thus hath cost thy life. Now is my day’s work done; I’ll take my breath: Rest, sword; thou hast thy fill of blood and death!   [_Disarms_.]   Enter Achilles and Myrmidons.  ACHILLES. Look, Hector, how the sun begins to set, How ugly night comes breathing at his heels; Even with the vail and dark’ning of the sun, To close the day up, Hector’s life is done.  HECTOR. I am unarm’d; forego this vantage, Greek.  ACHILLES. Strike, fellows, strike; this is the man I seek.   [_Hector falls_.]  So, Ilion, fall thou next! Now, Troy, sink down; Here lies thy heart, thy sinews, and thy bone. On, Myrmidons, and cry you all amain ‘Achilles hath the mighty Hector slain.’   [_A retreat sounded_.]  Hark! a retire upon our Grecian part.  MYRMIDON. The Trojan trumpets sound the like, my lord.  ACHILLES. The dragon wing of night o’erspreads the earth And, stickler-like, the armies separates. My half-supp’d sword, that frankly would have fed, Pleas’d with this dainty bait, thus goes to bed.   [_Sheathes his sword_.]  Come, tie his body to my horse’s tail; Along the field I will the Trojan trail.   [_Exeunt_.]  SCENE IX. Another part of the plain.   Sound retreat. Shout. Enter Agamemnon, Ajax, Menelaus, Nestor,  Diomedes and the rest, marching.  AGAMEMNON. Hark! hark! what shout is this?  NESTOR. Peace, drums!  SOLDIERS. [_Within_.] Achilles! Achilles! Hector’s slain. Achilles!  DIOMEDES. The bruit is, Hector’s slain, and by Achilles.  AJAX. If it be so, yet bragless let it be; Great Hector was as good a man as he.  AGAMEMNON. March patiently along. Let one be sent To pray Achilles see us at our tent. If in his death the gods have us befriended; Great Troy is ours, and our sharp wars are ended.   [_Exeunt_.]  SCENE X. Another part of the plain.   Enter Aeneas, Paris, Antenor and Deiphobus.  AENEAS. Stand, ho! yet are we masters of the field. Never go home; here starve we out the night.   Enter Troilus.  TROILUS. Hector is slain.  ALL. Hector! The gods forbid!  TROILUS. He’s dead, and at the murderer’s horse’s tail, In beastly sort, dragg’d through the shameful field. Frown on, you heavens, effect your rage with speed. Sit, gods, upon your thrones, and smile at Troy. I say at once let your brief plagues be mercy, And linger not our sure destructions on.  AENEAS. My lord, you do discomfort all the host.  TROILUS. You understand me not that tell me so. I do not speak of flight, of fear of death, But dare all imminence that gods and men Address their dangers in. Hector is gone. Who shall tell Priam so, or Hecuba? Let him that will a screech-owl aye be call’d Go in to Troy, and say there ‘Hector’s dead.’ There is a word will Priam turn to stone; Make wells and Niobes of the maids and wives, Cold statues of the youth; and, in a word, Scare Troy out of itself. But, march away; Hector is dead; there is no more to say. Stay yet. You vile abominable tents, Thus proudly pight upon our Phrygian plains, Let Titan rise as early as he dare, I’ll through and through you. And, thou great-siz’d coward, No space of earth shall sunder our two hates; I’ll haunt thee like a wicked conscience still, That mouldeth goblins swift as frenzy’s thoughts. Strike a free march to Troy. With comfort go; Hope of revenge shall hide our inward woe.   Enter Pandarus.  PANDARUS. But hear you, hear you!  TROILUS. Hence, broker-lackey. Ignominy and shame Pursue thy life, and live aye with thy name!   [_Exeunt all but_ Pandarus.]  PANDARUS. A goodly medicine for my aching bones! O world! world! Thus is the poor agent despis’d! O traitors and bawds, how earnestly are you set a-work, and how ill requited! Why should our endeavour be so lov’d, and the performance so loathed? What verse for it? What instance for it? Let me see—    Full merrily the humble-bee doth sing   Till he hath lost his honey and his sting;   And being once subdu’d in armed trail,   Sweet honey and sweet notes together fail.  Good traders in the flesh, set this in your painted cloths. As many as be here of Pandar’s hall, Your eyes, half out, weep out at Pandar’s fall; Or, if you cannot weep, yet give some groans, Though not for me, yet for your aching bones. Brethren and sisters of the hold-door trade, Some two months hence my will shall here be made. It should be now, but that my fear is this, Some galled goose of Winchester would hiss. Till then I’ll sweat and seek about for eases, And at that time bequeath you my diseases.   [_Exit_.]

  ACT I.  SCENE I. An Apartment in the Duke’s Palace.
 Enter Orsino, Duke of Illyria, Curio, and other Lords; Musicians  attending.  DUKE. If music be the food of love, play on, Give me excess of it; that, surfeiting, The appetite may sicken and so die. That strain again, it had a dying fall; O, it came o’er my ear like the sweet sound That breathes upon a bank of violets, Stealing and giving odour. Enough; no more; ’Tis not so sweet now as it was before. O spirit of love, how quick and fresh art thou, That notwithstanding thy capacity Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there, Of what validity and pitch soever, But falls into abatement and low price Even in a minute! So full of shapes is fancy, That it alone is high fantastical.  CURIO. Will you go hunt, my lord?  DUKE. What, Curio?  CURIO. The hart.  DUKE. Why so I do, the noblest that I have. O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first, Methought she purg’d the air of pestilence; That instant was I turn’d into a hart, And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds, E’er since pursue me. How now? what news from her?   Enter Valentine.  VALENTINE. So please my lord, I might not be admitted, But from her handmaid do return this answer: The element itself, till seven years’ heat, Shall not behold her face at ample view; But like a cloistress she will veiled walk, And water once a day her chamber round With eye-offending brine: all this to season A brother’s dead love, which she would keep fresh And lasting in her sad remembrance.  DUKE. O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame To pay this debt of love but to a brother, How will she love, when the rich golden shaft Hath kill’d the flock of all affections else That live in her; when liver, brain, and heart, These sovereign thrones, are all supplied and fill’d Her sweet perfections with one self king! Away before me to sweet beds of flowers, Love-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. The sea-coast.   Enter Viola, a Captain and Sailors.  VIOLA. What country, friends, is this?  CAPTAIN. This is Illyria, lady.  VIOLA. And what should I do in Illyria? My brother he is in Elysium. Perchance he is not drown’d. What think you, sailors?  CAPTAIN. It is perchance that you yourself were sav’d.  VIOLA. O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.  CAPTAIN. True, madam; and to comfort you with chance, Assure yourself, after our ship did split, When you, and those poor number sav’d with you, Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother, Most provident in peril, bind himself, (Courage and hope both teaching him the practice) To a strong mast that liv’d upon the sea; Where, like Arion on the dolphin’s back, I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves So long as I could see.  VIOLA. For saying so, there’s gold! Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope, Whereto thy speech serves for authority, The like of him. Know’st thou this country?  CAPTAIN. Ay, madam, well, for I was bred and born Not three hours’ travel from this very place.  VIOLA. Who governs here?  CAPTAIN. A noble duke, in nature as in name.  VIOLA. What is his name?  CAPTAIN. Orsino.  VIOLA. Orsino! I have heard my father name him. He was a bachelor then.  CAPTAIN. And so is now, or was so very late; For but a month ago I went from hence, And then ’twas fresh in murmur, (as, you know, What great ones do, the less will prattle of) That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.  VIOLA. What’s she?  CAPTAIN. A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count That died some twelvemonth since; then leaving her In the protection of his son, her brother, Who shortly also died; for whose dear love They say, she hath abjur’d the company And sight of men.  VIOLA. O that I served that lady, And might not be delivered to the world, Till I had made mine own occasion mellow, What my estate is.  CAPTAIN. That were hard to compass, Because she will admit no kind of suit, No, not the Duke’s.  VIOLA. There is a fair behaviour in thee, Captain; And though that nature with a beauteous wall Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee I will believe thou hast a mind that suits With this thy fair and outward character. I pray thee, and I’ll pay thee bounteously, Conceal me what I am, and be my aid For such disguise as haply shall become The form of my intent. I’ll serve this duke; Thou shalt present me as an eunuch to him. It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing, And speak to him in many sorts of music, That will allow me very worth his service. What else may hap, to time I will commit; Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.  CAPTAIN. Be you his eunuch and your mute I’ll be; When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.  VIOLA. I thank thee. Lead me on.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. A Room in Olivia’s House.   Enter Sir Toby and Maria.  SIR TOBY. What a plague means my niece to take the death of her brother thus? I am sure care’s an enemy to life.  MARIA. By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o’ nights; your cousin, my lady, takes great exceptions to your ill hours.  SIR TOBY. Why, let her except, before excepted.  MARIA. Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest limits of order.  SIR TOBY. Confine? I’ll confine myself no finer than I am. These clothes are good enough to drink in, and so be these boots too; and they be not, let them hang themselves in their own straps.  MARIA. That quaffing and drinking will undo you: I heard my lady talk of it yesterday; and of a foolish knight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer.  SIR TOBY. Who? Sir Andrew Aguecheek?  MARIA. Ay, he.  SIR TOBY. He’s as tall a man as any’s in Illyria.  MARIA. What’s that to th’ purpose?  SIR TOBY. Why, he has three thousand ducats a year.  MARIA. Ay, but he’ll have but a year in all these ducats. He’s a very fool, and a prodigal.  SIR TOBY. Fie, that you’ll say so! he plays o’ the viol-de-gamboys, and speaks three or four languages word for word without book, and hath all the good gifts of nature.  MARIA. He hath indeed, almost natural: for, besides that he’s a fool, he’s a great quarreller; and, but that he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he hath in quarrelling, ’tis thought among the prudent he would quickly have the gift of a grave.  SIR TOBY. By this hand, they are scoundrels and substractors that say so of him. Who are they?  MARIA. They that add, moreover, he’s drunk nightly in your company.  SIR TOBY. With drinking healths to my niece; I’ll drink to her as long as there is a passage in my throat, and drink in Illyria. He’s a coward and a coystril that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o’ the toe like a parish top. What, wench! _Castiliano vulgo:_ for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface.   Enter Sir Andrew.  AGUECHEEK. Sir Toby Belch! How now, Sir Toby Belch?  SIR TOBY. Sweet Sir Andrew!  SIR ANDREW. Bless you, fair shrew.  MARIA. And you too, sir.  SIR TOBY. Accost, Sir Andrew, accost.  SIR ANDREW. What’s that?  SIR TOBY. My niece’s chamber-maid.  SIR ANDREW. Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.  MARIA. My name is Mary, sir.  SIR ANDREW. Good Mistress Mary Accost,—  SIR TOBY. You mistake, knight: accost is front her, board her, woo her, assail her.  SIR ANDREW. By my troth, I would not undertake her in this company. Is that the meaning of accost?  MARIA. Fare you well, gentlemen.  SIR TOBY. And thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst never draw sword again.  SIR ANDREW. And you part so, mistress, I would I might never draw sword again. Fair lady, do you think you have fools in hand?  MARIA. Sir, I have not you by the hand.  SIR ANDREW. Marry, but you shall have, and here’s my hand.  MARIA. Now, sir, thought is free. I pray you, bring your hand to th’ buttery bar and let it drink.  SIR ANDREW. Wherefore, sweetheart? What’s your metaphor?  MARIA. It’s dry, sir.  SIR ANDREW. Why, I think so; I am not such an ass but I can keep my hand dry. But what’s your jest?  MARIA. A dry jest, sir.  SIR ANDREW. Are you full of them?  MARIA. Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers’ ends: marry, now I let go your hand, I am barren.   [_Exit Maria._]  SIR TOBY. O knight, thou lack’st a cup of canary: When did I see thee so put down?  SIR ANDREW. Never in your life, I think, unless you see canary put me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man has; but I am a great eater of beef, and I believe that does harm to my wit.  SIR TOBY. No question.  SIR ANDREW. And I thought that, I’d forswear it. I’ll ride home tomorrow, Sir Toby.  SIR TOBY. _Pourquoy_, my dear knight?  SIR ANDREW. What is _pourquoy?_ Do, or not do? I would I had bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in fencing, dancing, and bear-baiting. O, had I but followed the arts!  SIR TOBY. Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.  SIR ANDREW. Why, would that have mended my hair?  SIR TOBY. Past question; for thou seest it will not curl by nature.  SIR ANDREW. But it becomes me well enough, does’t not?  SIR TOBY. Excellent, it hangs like flax on a distaff; and I hope to see a huswife take thee between her legs, and spin it off.  SIR ANDREW. Faith, I’ll home tomorrow, Sir Toby; your niece will not be seen, or if she be, it’s four to one she’ll none of me; the Count himself here hard by woos her.  SIR TOBY. She’ll none o’ the Count; she’ll not match above her degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit; I have heard her swear’t. Tut, there’s life in’t, man.  SIR ANDREW. I’ll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o’ the strangest mind i’ the world; I delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether.  SIR TOBY. Art thou good at these kick-shawses, knight?  SIR ANDREW. As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the degree of my betters; and yet I will not compare with an old man.  SIR TOBY. What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?  SIR ANDREW. Faith, I can cut a caper.  SIR TOBY. And I can cut the mutton to’t.  SIR ANDREW. And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong as any man in Illyria.  SIR TOBY. Wherefore are these things hid? Wherefore have these gifts a curtain before ’em? Are they like to take dust, like Mistress Mall’s picture? Why dost thou not go to church in a galliard, and come home in a coranto? My very walk should be a jig; I would not so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace. What dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in? I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy leg, it was formed under the star of a galliard.  SIR ANDREW. Ay, ’tis strong, and it does indifferent well in a dam’d-colour’d stock. Shall we set about some revels?  SIR TOBY. What shall we do else? Were we not born under Taurus?  SIR ANDREW. Taurus? That’s sides and heart.  SIR TOBY. No, sir, it is legs and thighs. Let me see thee caper. Ha, higher: ha, ha, excellent!   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IV. A Room in the Duke’s Palace.   Enter Valentine and Viola in man’s attire.  VALENTINE. If the duke continue these favours towards you, Cesario, you are like to be much advanced; he hath known you but three days, and already you are no stranger.  VIOLA. You either fear his humour or my negligence, that you call in question the continuance of his love. Is he inconstant, sir, in his favours?  VALENTINE. No, believe me.   Enter Duke, Curio and Attendants.  VIOLA. I thank you. Here comes the Count.  DUKE. Who saw Cesario, ho?  VIOLA. On your attendance, my lord, here.  DUKE. Stand you awhile aloof.—Cesario, Thou know’st no less but all; I have unclasp’d To thee the book even of my secret soul. Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her, Be not denied access, stand at her doors, And tell them, there thy fixed foot shall grow Till thou have audience.  VIOLA. Sure, my noble lord, If she be so abandon’d to her sorrow As it is spoke, she never will admit me.  DUKE. Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds, Rather than make unprofited return.  VIOLA. Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then?  DUKE. O then unfold the passion of my love, Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith; It shall become thee well to act my woes; She will attend it better in thy youth, Than in a nuncio’s of more grave aspect.  VIOLA. I think not so, my lord.  DUKE. Dear lad, believe it; For they shall yet belie thy happy years, That say thou art a man: Diana’s lip Is not more smooth and rubious; thy small pipe Is as the maiden’s organ, shrill and sound, And all is semblative a woman’s part. I know thy constellation is right apt For this affair. Some four or five attend him: All, if you will; for I myself am best When least in company. Prosper well in this, And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord, To call his fortunes thine.  VIOLA. I’ll do my best To woo your lady. [_Aside._] Yet, a barful strife! Whoe’er I woo, myself would be his wife.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE V. A Room in Olivia’s House.   Enter Maria and Clown.  MARIA. Nay; either tell me where thou hast been, or I will not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter, in way of thy excuse: my lady will hang thee for thy absence.  CLOWN. Let her hang me: he that is well hanged in this world needs to fear no colours.  MARIA. Make that good.  CLOWN. He shall see none to fear.  MARIA. A good lenten answer. I can tell thee where that saying was born, of I fear no colours.  CLOWN. Where, good Mistress Mary?  MARIA. In the wars, and that may you be bold to say in your foolery.  CLOWN. Well, God give them wisdom that have it; and those that are fools, let them use their talents.  MARIA. Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent; or to be turned away; is not that as good as a hanging to you?  CLOWN. Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage; and for turning away, let summer bear it out.  MARIA. You are resolute then?  CLOWN. Not so, neither, but I am resolved on two points.  MARIA. That if one break, the other will hold; or if both break, your gaskins fall.  CLOWN. Apt, in good faith, very apt! Well, go thy way; if Sir Toby would leave drinking, thou wert as witty a piece of Eve’s flesh as any in Illyria.  MARIA. Peace, you rogue, no more o’ that. Here comes my lady: make your excuse wisely, you were best.   [_Exit._]   Enter Olivia with Malvolio.  CLOWN. Wit, and’t be thy will, put me into good fooling! Those wits that think they have thee, do very oft prove fools; and I that am sure I lack thee, may pass for a wise man. For what says Quinapalus? Better a witty fool than a foolish wit. God bless thee, lady!  OLIVIA. Take the fool away.  CLOWN. Do you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady.  OLIVIA. Go to, y’are a dry fool; I’ll no more of you. Besides, you grow dishonest.  CLOWN. Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel will amend: for give the dry fool drink, then is the fool not dry; bid the dishonest man mend himself, if he mend, he is no longer dishonest; if he cannot, let the botcher mend him. Anything that’s mended is but patched; virtue that transgresses is but patched with sin, and sin that amends is but patched with virtue. If that this simple syllogism will serve, so; if it will not, what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but calamity, so beauty’s a flower. The lady bade take away the fool, therefore, I say again, take her away.  OLIVIA. Sir, I bade them take away you.  CLOWN. Misprision in the highest degree! Lady, _cucullus non facit monachum:_ that’s as much to say, I wear not motley in my brain. Good madonna, give me leave to prove you a fool.  OLIVIA. Can you do it?  CLOWN. Dexteriously, good madonna.  OLIVIA. Make your proof.  CLOWN. I must catechize you for it, madonna. Good my mouse of virtue, answer me.  OLIVIA. Well sir, for want of other idleness, I’ll ’bide your proof.  CLOWN. Good madonna, why mourn’st thou?  OLIVIA. Good fool, for my brother’s death.  CLOWN. I think his soul is in hell, madonna.  OLIVIA. I know his soul is in heaven, fool.  CLOWN. The more fool you, madonna, to mourn for your brother’s soul being in heaven. Take away the fool, gentlemen.  OLIVIA. What think you of this fool, Malvolio? doth he not mend?  MALVOLIO. Yes; and shall do, till the pangs of death shake him. Infirmity, that decays the wise, doth ever make the better fool.  CLOWN. God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the better increasing your folly! Sir Toby will be sworn that I am no fox; but he will not pass his word for twopence that you are no fool.  OLIVIA. How say you to that, Malvolio?  MALVOLIO. I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren rascal; I saw him put down the other day with an ordinary fool, that has no more brain than a stone. Look you now, he’s out of his guard already; unless you laugh and minister occasion to him, he is gagged. I protest I take these wise men, that crow so at these set kind of fools, no better than the fools’ zanies.  OLIVIA. O, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste with a distempered appetite. To be generous, guiltless, and of free disposition, is to take those things for bird-bolts that you deem cannon bullets. There is no slander in an allowed fool, though he do nothing but rail; nor no railing in a known discreet man, though he do nothing but reprove.  CLOWN. Now Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou speak’st well of fools!   Enter Maria.  MARIA. Madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman much desires to speak with you.  OLIVIA. From the Count Orsino, is it?  MARIA. I know not, madam; ’tis a fair young man, and well attended.  OLIVIA. Who of my people hold him in delay?  MARIA. Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman.  OLIVIA. Fetch him off, I pray you; he speaks nothing but madman. Fie on him!   [_Exit Maria._]  Go you, Malvolio. If it be a suit from the Count, I am sick, or not at home. What you will, to dismiss it.   [_Exit Malvolio._]  Now you see, sir, how your fooling grows old, and people dislike it.  CLOWN. Thou hast spoke for us, madonna, as if thy eldest son should be a fool: whose skull Jove cram with brains, for here he comes, one of thy kin has a most weak _pia mater_.   Enter Sir Toby.  OLIVIA. By mine honour, half drunk. What is he at the gate, cousin?  SIR TOBY. A gentleman.  OLIVIA. A gentleman? What gentleman?  SIR TOBY. ’Tis a gentleman here. A plague o’ these pickle-herrings! How now, sot?  CLOWN. Good Sir Toby.  OLIVIA. Cousin, cousin, how have you come so early by this lethargy?  SIR TOBY. Lechery! I defy lechery. There’s one at the gate.  OLIVIA. Ay, marry, what is he?  SIR TOBY. Let him be the devil an he will, I care not: give me faith, say I. Well, it’s all one.   [_Exit._]  OLIVIA. What’s a drunken man like, fool?  CLOWN. Like a drowned man, a fool, and a madman: one draught above heat makes him a fool, the second mads him, and a third drowns him.  OLIVIA. Go thou and seek the coroner, and let him sit o’ my coz; for he’s in the third degree of drink; he’s drowned. Go, look after him.  CLOWN. He is but mad yet, madonna; and the fool shall look to the madman.   [_Exit Clown._]   Enter Malvolio.  MALVOLIO. Madam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with you. I told him you were sick; he takes on him to understand so much, and therefore comes to speak with you. I told him you were asleep; he seems to have a foreknowledge of that too, and therefore comes to speak with you. What is to be said to him, lady? He’s fortified against any denial.  OLIVIA. Tell him, he shall not speak with me.  MALVOLIO. Has been told so; and he says he’ll stand at your door like a sheriff’s post, and be the supporter of a bench, but he’ll speak with you.  OLIVIA. What kind o’ man is he?  MALVOLIO. Why, of mankind.  OLIVIA. What manner of man?  MALVOLIO. Of very ill manner; he’ll speak with you, will you or no.  OLIVIA. Of what personage and years is he?  MALVOLIO. Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for a boy; as a squash is before ’tis a peascod, or a codling, when ’tis almost an apple. ’Tis with him in standing water, between boy and man. He is very well-favoured, and he speaks very shrewishly. One would think his mother’s milk were scarce out of him.  OLIVIA. Let him approach. Call in my gentlewoman.  MALVOLIO. Gentlewoman, my lady calls.   [_Exit._]   Enter Maria.  OLIVIA. Give me my veil; come, throw it o’er my face. We’ll once more hear Orsino’s embassy.   Enter Viola.  VIOLA. The honourable lady of the house, which is she?  OLIVIA. Speak to me; I shall answer for her. Your will?  VIOLA. Most radiant, exquisite, and unmatchable beauty,—I pray you, tell me if this be the lady of the house, for I never saw her. I would be loath to cast away my speech; for besides that it is excellently well penned, I have taken great pains to con it. Good beauties, let me sustain no scorn; I am very comptible, even to the least sinister usage.  OLIVIA. Whence came you, sir?  VIOLA. I can say little more than I have studied, and that question’s out of my part. Good gentle one, give me modest assurance, if you be the lady of the house, that I may proceed in my speech.  OLIVIA. Are you a comedian?  VIOLA. No, my profound heart: and yet, by the very fangs of malice I swear, I am not that I play. Are you the lady of the house?  OLIVIA. If I do not usurp myself, I am.  VIOLA. Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp yourself; for what is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve. But this is from my commission. I will on with my speech in your praise, and then show you the heart of my message.  OLIVIA. Come to what is important in’t: I forgive you the praise.  VIOLA. Alas, I took great pains to study it, and ’tis poetical.  OLIVIA. It is the more like to be feigned; I pray you keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates; and allowed your approach, rather to wonder at you than to hear you. If you be mad, be gone; if you have reason, be brief: ’tis not that time of moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue.  MARIA. Will you hoist sail, sir? Here lies your way.  VIOLA. No, good swabber, I am to hull here a little longer. Some mollification for your giant, sweet lady. Tell me your mind. I am a messenger.  OLIVIA. Sure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, when the courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your office.  VIOLA. It alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture of war, no taxation of homage; I hold the olive in my hand: my words are as full of peace as matter.  OLIVIA. Yet you began rudely. What are you? What would you?  VIOLA. The rudeness that hath appeared in me have I learned from my entertainment. What I am and what I would are as secret as maidenhead: to your ears, divinity; to any other’s, profanation.  OLIVIA. Give us the place alone: we will hear this divinity.   [_Exit Maria._]  Now, sir, what is your text?  VIOLA. Most sweet lady—  OLIVIA. A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it. Where lies your text?  VIOLA. In Orsino’s bosom.  OLIVIA. In his bosom? In what chapter of his bosom?  VIOLA. To answer by the method, in the first of his heart.  OLIVIA. O, I have read it; it is heresy. Have you no more to say?  VIOLA. Good madam, let me see your face.  OLIVIA. Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my face? You are now out of your text: but we will draw the curtain and show you the picture. [_Unveiling._] Look you, sir, such a one I was this present. Is’t not well done?  VIOLA. Excellently done, if God did all.  OLIVIA. ’Tis in grain, sir; ’twill endure wind and weather.  VIOLA. ’Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white Nature’s own sweet and cunning hand laid on. Lady, you are the cruel’st she alive If you will lead these graces to the grave, And leave the world no copy.  OLIVIA. O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted; I will give out divers schedules of my beauty. It shall be inventoried and every particle and utensil labelled to my will: as, item, two lips indifferent red; item, two grey eyes with lids to them; item, one neck, one chin, and so forth. Were you sent hither to praise me?  VIOLA. I see you what you are, you are too proud; But, if you were the devil, you are fair. My lord and master loves you. O, such love Could be but recompens’d though you were crown’d The nonpareil of beauty!  OLIVIA. How does he love me?  VIOLA. With adorations, fertile tears, With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.  OLIVIA. Your lord does know my mind, I cannot love him: Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble, Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth; In voices well divulg’d, free, learn’d, and valiant, And in dimension and the shape of nature, A gracious person. But yet I cannot love him. He might have took his answer long ago.  VIOLA. If I did love you in my master’s flame, With such a suff’ring, such a deadly life, In your denial I would find no sense, I would not understand it.  OLIVIA. Why, what would you?  VIOLA. Make me a willow cabin at your gate, And call upon my soul within the house; Write loyal cantons of contemned love, And sing them loud even in the dead of night; Hallow your name to the reverberate hills, And make the babbling gossip of the air Cry out Olivia! O, you should not rest Between the elements of air and earth, But you should pity me.  OLIVIA. You might do much. What is your parentage?  VIOLA. Above my fortunes, yet my state is well: I am a gentleman.  OLIVIA. Get you to your lord; I cannot love him: let him send no more, Unless, perchance, you come to me again, To tell me how he takes it. Fare you well: I thank you for your pains: spend this for me.  VIOLA. I am no fee’d post, lady; keep your purse; My master, not myself, lacks recompense. Love make his heart of flint that you shall love, And let your fervour like my master’s be Plac’d in contempt. Farewell, fair cruelty.   [_Exit._]  OLIVIA. What is your parentage? ‘Above my fortunes, yet my state is well: I am a gentleman.’ I’ll be sworn thou art; Thy tongue, thy face, thy limbs, actions, and spirit, Do give thee five-fold blazon. Not too fast: soft, soft! Unless the master were the man. How now? Even so quickly may one catch the plague? Methinks I feel this youth’s perfections With an invisible and subtle stealth To creep in at mine eyes. Well, let it be. What ho, Malvolio!   Enter Malvolio.  MALVOLIO. Here, madam, at your service.  OLIVIA. Run after that same peevish messenger The County’s man: he left this ring behind him, Would I or not; tell him, I’ll none of it. Desire him not to flatter with his lord, Nor hold him up with hopes; I am not for him. If that the youth will come this way tomorrow, I’ll give him reasons for’t. Hie thee, Malvolio.  MALVOLIO. Madam, I will.   [_Exit._]  OLIVIA. I do I know not what, and fear to find Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind. Fate, show thy force, ourselves we do not owe. What is decreed must be; and be this so!   [_Exit._]
  ACT II.  SCENE I. The sea-coast.
  ACT III.  SCENE I. Olivia’s garden.
 Enter Viola and Clown with a tabor.  VIOLA. Save thee, friend, and thy music. Dost thou live by thy tabor?  CLOWN. No, sir, I live by the church.  VIOLA. Art thou a churchman?  CLOWN. No such matter, sir. I do live by the church, for I do live at my house, and my house doth stand by the church.  VIOLA. So thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar, if a beggar dwell near him; or the church stands by thy tabor, if thy tabor stand by the church.  CLOWN. You have said, sir. To see this age! A sentence is but a chev’ril glove to a good wit. How quickly the wrong side may be turned outward!  VIOLA. Nay, that’s certain; they that dally nicely with words may quickly make them wanton.  CLOWN. I would, therefore, my sister had had no name, sir.  VIOLA. Why, man?  CLOWN. Why, sir, her name’s a word; and to dally with that word might make my sister wanton. But indeed, words are very rascals, since bonds disgraced them.  VIOLA. Thy reason, man?  CLOWN. Troth, sir, I can yield you none without words, and words are grown so false, I am loath to prove reason with them.  VIOLA. I warrant thou art a merry fellow, and car’st for nothing.  CLOWN. Not so, sir, I do care for something. But in my conscience, sir, I do not care for you. If that be to care for nothing, sir, I would it would make you invisible.  VIOLA. Art not thou the Lady Olivia’s fool?  CLOWN. No, indeed, sir; the Lady Olivia has no folly. She will keep no fool, sir, till she be married, and fools are as like husbands as pilchards are to herrings, the husband’s the bigger. I am indeed not her fool, but her corrupter of words.  VIOLA. I saw thee late at the Count Orsino’s.  CLOWN. Foolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun; it shines everywhere. I would be sorry, sir, but the fool should be as oft with your master as with my mistress. I think I saw your wisdom there.  VIOLA. Nay, and thou pass upon me, I’ll no more with thee. Hold, there’s expenses for thee.  CLOWN. Now Jove, in his next commodity of hair, send thee a beard!  VIOLA. By my troth, I’ll tell thee, I am almost sick for one, though I would not have it grow on my chin. Is thy lady within?  CLOWN. Would not a pair of these have bred, sir?  VIOLA. Yes, being kept together, and put to use.  CLOWN. I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia, sir, to bring a Cressida to this Troilus.  VIOLA. I understand you, sir; ’tis well begged.  CLOWN. The matter, I hope, is not great, sir, begging but a beggar: Cressida was a beggar. My lady is within, sir. I will conster to them whence you come; who you are and what you would are out of my welkin. I might say “element”, but the word is overworn.   [_Exit._]  VIOLA. This fellow is wise enough to play the fool, And to do that well, craves a kind of wit: He must observe their mood on whom he jests, The quality of persons, and the time, And like the haggard, check at every feather That comes before his eye. This is a practice As full of labour as a wise man’s art: For folly, that he wisely shows, is fit; But wise men, folly-fall’n, quite taint their wit.   Enter Sir Toby and Sir Andrew.  SIR TOBY. Save you, gentleman.  VIOLA. And you, sir.  SIR ANDREW. _Dieu vous garde, monsieur._  VIOLA. _Et vous aussi; votre serviteur._  SIR ANDREW. I hope, sir, you are, and I am yours.  SIR TOBY. Will you encounter the house? My niece is desirous you should enter, if your trade be to her.  VIOLA. I am bound to your niece, sir, I mean, she is the list of my voyage.  SIR TOBY. Taste your legs, sir, put them to motion.  VIOLA. My legs do better understand me, sir, than I understand what you mean by bidding me taste my legs.  SIR TOBY. I mean, to go, sir, to enter.  VIOLA. I will answer you with gait and entrance: but we are prevented.   Enter Olivia and Maria.  Most excellent accomplished lady, the heavens rain odours on you!  SIR ANDREW. That youth’s a rare courtier. ‘Rain odours,’ well.  VIOLA. My matter hath no voice, lady, but to your own most pregnant and vouchsafed ear.  SIR ANDREW. ‘Odours,’ ‘pregnant,’ and ‘vouchsafed.’—I’ll get ’em all three ready.  OLIVIA. Let the garden door be shut, and leave me to my hearing.   [_Exeunt Sir Toby, Sir Andrew and Maria._]  Give me your hand, sir.  VIOLA. My duty, madam, and most humble service.  OLIVIA. What is your name?  VIOLA. Cesario is your servant’s name, fair princess.  OLIVIA. My servant, sir! ’Twas never merry world, Since lowly feigning was call’d compliment: Y’are servant to the Count Orsino, youth.  VIOLA. And he is yours, and his must needs be yours. Your servant’s servant is your servant, madam.  OLIVIA. For him, I think not on him: for his thoughts, Would they were blanks rather than fill’d with me!  VIOLA. Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts On his behalf.  OLIVIA. O, by your leave, I pray you. I bade you never speak again of him. But would you undertake another suit, I had rather hear you to solicit that Than music from the spheres.  VIOLA. Dear lady—  OLIVIA. Give me leave, beseech you. I did send, After the last enchantment you did here, A ring in chase of you. So did I abuse Myself, my servant, and, I fear me, you. Under your hard construction must I sit; To force that on you in a shameful cunning, Which you knew none of yours. What might you think? Have you not set mine honour at the stake, And baited it with all th’ unmuzzled thoughts That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving Enough is shown. A cypress, not a bosom, Hides my heart: so let me hear you speak.  VIOLA. I pity you.  OLIVIA. That’s a degree to love.  VIOLA. No, not a grize; for ’tis a vulgar proof That very oft we pity enemies.  OLIVIA. Why then methinks ’tis time to smile again. O world, how apt the poor are to be proud! If one should be a prey, how much the better To fall before the lion than the wolf! [_Clock strikes._] The clock upbraids me with the waste of time. Be not afraid, good youth, I will not have you. And yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest, Your wife is like to reap a proper man. There lies your way, due west.  VIOLA. Then westward ho! Grace and good disposition attend your ladyship! You’ll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?  OLIVIA. Stay: I prithee tell me what thou think’st of me.  VIOLA. That you do think you are not what you are.  OLIVIA. If I think so, I think the same of you.  VIOLA. Then think you right; I am not what I am.  OLIVIA. I would you were as I would have you be.  VIOLA. Would it be better, madam, than I am? I wish it might, for now I am your fool.  OLIVIA. O what a deal of scorn looks beautiful In the contempt and anger of his lip! A murd’rous guilt shows not itself more soon Than love that would seem hid. Love’s night is noon. Cesario, by the roses of the spring, By maidhood, honour, truth, and everything, I love thee so, that maugre all thy pride, Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide. Do not extort thy reasons from this clause, For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause; But rather reason thus with reason fetter: Love sought is good, but given unsought is better.  VIOLA. By innocence I swear, and by my youth, I have one heart, one bosom, and one truth, And that no woman has; nor never none Shall mistress be of it, save I alone. And so adieu, good madam; never more Will I my master’s tears to you deplore.  OLIVIA. Yet come again: for thou perhaps mayst move That heart, which now abhors, to like his love.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. A Room in Olivia’s House.   Enter Sir Toby, Sir Andrew and Fabian.  SIR ANDREW. No, faith, I’ll not stay a jot longer.  SIR TOBY. Thy reason, dear venom, give thy reason.  FABIAN. You must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew.  SIR ANDREW. Marry, I saw your niece do more favours to the Count’s servingman than ever she bestowed upon me; I saw’t i’ th’ orchard.  SIR TOBY. Did she see thee the while, old boy? Tell me that.  SIR ANDREW. As plain as I see you now.  FABIAN. This was a great argument of love in her toward you.  SIR ANDREW. ’Slight! will you make an ass o’ me?  FABIAN. I will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of judgment and reason.  SIR TOBY. And they have been grand-jurymen since before Noah was a sailor.  FABIAN. She did show favour to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valour, to put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver. You should then have accosted her, and with some excellent jests, fire-new from the mint, you should have banged the youth into dumbness. This was looked for at your hand, and this was balked: the double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash off, and you are now sailed into the north of my lady’s opinion; where you will hang like an icicle on Dutchman’s beard, unless you do redeem it by some laudable attempt, either of valour or policy.  SIR ANDREW. And’t be any way, it must be with valour, for policy I hate; I had as lief be a Brownist as a politician.  SIR TOBY. Why, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valour. Challenge me the Count’s youth to fight with him. Hurt him in eleven places; my niece shall take note of it, and assure thyself there is no love-broker in the world can more prevail in man’s commendation with woman than report of valour.  FABIAN. There is no way but this, Sir Andrew.  SIR ANDREW. Will either of you bear me a challenge to him?  SIR TOBY. Go, write it in a martial hand, be curst and brief; it is no matter how witty, so it be eloquent and full of invention. Taunt him with the licence of ink. If thou ‘thou’st’ him some thrice, it shall not be amiss, and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of paper, although the sheet were big enough for the bed of Ware in England, set ’em down. Go about it. Let there be gall enough in thy ink, though thou write with a goose-pen, no matter. About it.  SIR ANDREW. Where shall I find you?  SIR TOBY. We’ll call thee at the cubiculo. Go.   [_Exit Sir Andrew._]  FABIAN. This is a dear manikin to you, Sir Toby.  SIR TOBY. I have been dear to him, lad, some two thousand strong, or so.  FABIAN. We shall have a rare letter from him; but you’ll not deliver it.  SIR TOBY. Never trust me then. And by all means stir on the youth to an answer. I think oxen and wainropes cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he were opened and you find so much blood in his liver as will clog the foot of a flea, I’ll eat the rest of th’ anatomy.  FABIAN. And his opposite, the youth, bears in his visage no great presage of cruelty.   Enter Maria.  SIR TOBY. Look where the youngest wren of nine comes.  MARIA. If you desire the spleen, and will laugh yourselves into stitches, follow me. Yond gull Malvolio is turned heathen, a very renegado; for there is no Christian that means to be saved by believing rightly can ever believe such impossible passages of grossness. He’s in yellow stockings.  SIR TOBY. And cross-gartered?  MARIA. Most villainously; like a pedant that keeps a school i’ th’ church. I have dogged him like his murderer. He does obey every point of the letter that I dropped to betray him. He does smile his face into more lines than is in the new map with the augmentation of the Indies. You have not seen such a thing as ’tis. I  can hardly forbear hurling things at him. I know my lady will strike him. If she do, he’ll smile and take’t for a great favour.  SIR TOBY. Come, bring us, bring us where he is.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. A street.   Enter Sebastian and Antonio.  SEBASTIAN. I would not by my will have troubled you, But since you make your pleasure of your pains, I will no further chide you.  ANTONIO. I could not stay behind you: my desire, More sharp than filed steel, did spur me forth; And not all love to see you, though so much, As might have drawn one to a longer voyage, But jealousy what might befall your travel, Being skilless in these parts; which to a stranger, Unguided and unfriended, often prove Rough and unhospitable. My willing love, The rather by these arguments of fear, Set forth in your pursuit.  SEBASTIAN. My kind Antonio, I can no other answer make but thanks, And thanks, and ever thanks; and oft good turns Are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay. But were my worth, as is my conscience, firm, You should find better dealing. What’s to do? Shall we go see the relics of this town?  ANTONIO. Tomorrow, sir; best first go see your lodging.  SEBASTIAN. I am not weary, and ’tis long to night; I pray you, let us satisfy our eyes With the memorials and the things of fame That do renown this city.  ANTONIO. Would you’d pardon me. I do not without danger walk these streets. Once in a sea-fight, ’gainst the Count his galleys, I did some service, of such note indeed, That were I ta’en here, it would scarce be answer’d.  SEBASTIAN. Belike you slew great number of his people.  ANTONIO. Th’ offence is not of such a bloody nature, Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel Might well have given us bloody argument. It might have since been answered in repaying What we took from them, which for traffic’s sake, Most of our city did. Only myself stood out, For which, if I be lapsed in this place, I shall pay dear.  SEBASTIAN. Do not then walk too open.  ANTONIO. It doth not fit me. Hold, sir, here’s my purse. In the south suburbs, at the Elephant, Is best to lodge. I will bespeak our diet Whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge With viewing of the town. There shall you have me.  SEBASTIAN. Why I your purse?  ANTONIO. Haply your eye shall light upon some toy You have desire to purchase; and your store, I think, is not for idle markets, sir.  SEBASTIAN. I’ll be your purse-bearer, and leave you for an hour.  ANTONIO. To th’ Elephant.  SEBASTIAN. I do remember.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IV. Olivia’s garden.   Enter Olivia and Maria.  OLIVIA. I have sent after him. He says he’ll come; How shall I feast him? What bestow of him? For youth is bought more oft than begg’d or borrow’d. I speak too loud.— Where’s Malvolio?—He is sad and civil, And suits well for a servant with my fortunes; Where is Malvolio?  MARIA. He’s coming, madam: But in very strange manner. He is sure possessed, madam.  OLIVIA. Why, what’s the matter? Does he rave?  MARIA. No, madam, he does nothing but smile: your ladyship were best to have some guard about you if he come, for sure the man is tainted in ’s wits.  OLIVIA. Go call him hither. I’m as mad as he, If sad and merry madness equal be.   Enter Malvolio.  How now, Malvolio?  MALVOLIO. Sweet lady, ho, ho!  OLIVIA. Smil’st thou? I sent for thee upon a sad occasion.  MALVOLIO. Sad, lady? I could be sad: this does make some obstruction in the blood, this cross-gartering. But what of that? If it please the eye of one, it is with me as the very true sonnet is: ‘Please one and please all.’  OLIVIA. Why, how dost thou, man? What is the matter with thee?  MALVOLIO. Not black in my mind, though yellow in my legs. It did come to his hands, and commands shall be executed. I think we do know the sweet Roman hand.  OLIVIA. Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?  MALVOLIO. To bed? Ay, sweetheart, and I’ll come to thee.  OLIVIA. God comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so, and kiss thy hand so oft?  MARIA. How do you, Malvolio?  MALVOLIO. At your request? Yes, nightingales answer daws!  MARIA. Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady?  MALVOLIO. ‘Be not afraid of greatness.’ ’Twas well writ.  OLIVIA. What mean’st thou by that, Malvolio?  MALVOLIO. ‘Some are born great’—  OLIVIA. Ha?  MALVOLIO. ‘Some achieve greatness’—  OLIVIA. What say’st thou?  MALVOLIO. ‘And some have greatness thrust upon them.’  OLIVIA. Heaven restore thee!  MALVOLIO. ‘Remember who commended thy yellow stockings’—  OLIVIA. Thy yellow stockings?  MALVOLIO. ‘And wished to see thee cross-gartered.’  OLIVIA. Cross-gartered?  MALVOLIO. ‘Go to: thou art made, if thou desir’st to be so:’—  OLIVIA. Am I made?  MALVOLIO. ‘If not, let me see thee a servant still.’  OLIVIA. Why, this is very midsummer madness.   Enter Servant.  SERVANT. Madam, the young gentleman of the Count Orsino’s is returned; I could hardly entreat him back. He attends your ladyship’s pleasure.  OLIVIA. I’ll come to him.   [_Exit Servant._]  Good Maria, let this fellow be looked to. Where’s my cousin Toby? Let some of my people have a special care of him; I would not have him miscarry for the half of my dowry.   [_Exeunt Olivia and Maria._]  MALVOLIO. O ho, do you come near me now? No worse man than Sir Toby to look to me. This concurs directly with the letter: she sends him on purpose, that I may appear stubborn to him; for she incites me to that in the letter. ‘Cast thy humble slough,’ says she; ‘be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants, let thy tongue tang with arguments of state, put thyself into the trick of singularity,’ and consequently, sets down the manner how: as, a sad face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the habit of some sir of note, and so forth. I have limed her, but it is Jove’s doing, and Jove make me thankful! And when she went away now, ‘Let this fellow be looked to;’ ‘Fellow!’ not ‘Malvolio’, nor after my degree, but ‘fellow’. Why, everything adheres together, that no dram of a scruple, no scruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous or unsafe circumstance. What can be said? Nothing that can be can come between me and the full prospect of my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the doer of this, and he is to be thanked.   Enter Sir Toby, Fabian and Maria.  SIR TOBY. Which way is he, in the name of sanctity? If all the devils of hell be drawn in little, and Legion himself possessed him, yet I’ll speak to him.  FABIAN. Here he is, here he is. How is’t with you, sir? How is’t with you, man?  MALVOLIO. Go off, I discard you. Let me enjoy my private. Go off.  MARIA. Lo, how hollow the fiend speaks within him! Did not I tell you? Sir Toby, my lady prays you to have a care of him.  MALVOLIO. Ah, ha! does she so?  SIR TOBY. Go to, go to; peace, peace, we must deal gently with him. Let me alone. How do you, Malvolio? How is’t with you? What, man! defy the devil! Consider, he’s an enemy to mankind.  MALVOLIO. Do you know what you say?  MARIA. La you, an you speak ill of the devil, how he takes it at heart! Pray God he be not bewitched.  FABIAN. Carry his water to th’ wise woman.  MARIA. Marry, and it shall be done tomorrow morning, if I live. My lady would not lose him for more than I’ll say.  MALVOLIO. How now, mistress!  MARIA. O Lord!  SIR TOBY. Prithee hold thy peace, this is not the way. Do you not see you move him? Let me alone with him.  FABIAN. No way but gentleness, gently, gently. The fiend is rough, and will not be roughly used.  SIR TOBY. Why, how now, my bawcock? How dost thou, chuck?  MALVOLIO. Sir!  SIR TOBY. Ay, biddy, come with me. What, man, ’tis not for gravity to play at cherry-pit with Satan. Hang him, foul collier!  MARIA. Get him to say his prayers, good Sir Toby, get him to pray.  MALVOLIO. My prayers, minx?  MARIA. No, I warrant you, he will not hear of godliness.  MALVOLIO. Go, hang yourselves all! You are idle, shallow things. I am not of your element. You shall know more hereafter.   [_Exit._]  SIR TOBY. Is’t possible?  FABIAN. If this were played upon a stage now, I could condemn it as an improbable fiction.  SIR TOBY. His very genius hath taken the infection of the device, man.  MARIA. Nay, pursue him now, lest the device take air and taint.  FABIAN. Why, we shall make him mad indeed.  MARIA. The house will be the quieter.  SIR TOBY. Come, we’ll have him in a dark room and bound. My niece is already in the belief that he’s mad. We may carry it thus for our pleasure, and his penance, till our very pastime, tired out of breath, prompt us to have mercy on him, at which time we will bring the device to the bar, and crown thee for a finder of madmen. But see, but see!   Enter Sir Andrew.  FABIAN. More matter for a May morning.  SIR ANDREW. Here’s the challenge, read it. I warrant there’s vinegar and pepper in’t.  FABIAN. Is’t so saucy?  SIR ANDREW. Ay, is’t, I warrant him. Do but read.  SIR TOBY. Give me. [_Reads._] _Youth, whatsoever thou art, thou art but a scurvy fellow._  FABIAN. Good, and valiant.  SIR TOBY. _Wonder not, nor admire not in thy mind, why I do call thee so, for I will show thee no reason for’t._  FABIAN. A good note, that keeps you from the blow of the law.  SIR TOBY. _Thou comest to the Lady Olivia, and in my sight she uses thee kindly: but thou liest in thy throat; that is not the matter I challenge thee for._  FABIAN. Very brief, and to exceeding good sense—less.  SIR TOBY. _I will waylay thee going home; where if it be thy chance to kill me—_  FABIAN. Good.  SIR TOBY. _Thou kill’st me like a rogue and a villain._  FABIAN. Still you keep o’ th’ windy side of the law. Good.  SIR TOBY. _Fare thee well, and God have mercy upon one of our souls! He may have mercy upon mine, but my hope is better, and so look to thyself. Thy friend, as thou usest him, and thy sworn enemy,                         Andrew Aguecheek._ If this letter move him not, his legs cannot. I’ll give’t him.  MARIA. You may have very fit occasion for’t. He is now in some commerce with my lady, and will by and by depart.  SIR TOBY. Go, Sir Andrew. Scout me for him at the corner of the orchard, like a bum-baily. So soon as ever thou seest him, draw, and as thou draw’st, swear horrible, for it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath, with a swaggering accent sharply twanged off, gives manhood more approbation than ever proof itself would have earned him. Away.  SIR ANDREW. Nay, let me alone for swearing.   [_Exit._]  SIR TOBY. Now will not I deliver his letter, for the behaviour of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good capacity and breeding; his employment between his lord and my niece confirms no less. Therefore this letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed no terror in the youth. He will find it comes from a clodpole. But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by word of mouth, set upon Aguecheek notable report of valour, and drive the gentleman (as I know his youth will aptly receive it) into a most hideous opinion of his rage, skill, fury, and impetuosity. This will so fright them both that they will kill one another by the look, like cockatrices.   Enter Olivia and Viola.  FABIAN. Here he comes with your niece; give them way till he take leave, and presently after him.  SIR TOBY. I will meditate the while upon some horrid message for a challenge.   [_Exeunt Sir Toby, Fabian and Maria._]  OLIVIA. I have said too much unto a heart of stone, And laid mine honour too unchary on’t: There’s something in me that reproves my fault: But such a headstrong potent fault it is, That it but mocks reproof.  VIOLA. With the same ’haviour that your passion bears Goes on my master’s griefs.  OLIVIA. Here, wear this jewel for me, ’tis my picture. Refuse it not, it hath no tongue to vex you. And I beseech you come again tomorrow. What shall you ask of me that I’ll deny, That honour sav’d, may upon asking give?  VIOLA. Nothing but this, your true love for my master.  OLIVIA. How with mine honour may I give him that Which I have given to you?  VIOLA. I will acquit you.  OLIVIA. Well, come again tomorrow. Fare thee well; A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.   [_Exit._]   Enter Sir Toby and Fabian.  SIR TOBY. Gentleman, God save thee.  VIOLA. And you, sir.  SIR TOBY. That defence thou hast, betake thee to’t. Of what nature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I know not, but thy intercepter, full of despite, bloody as the hunter, attends thee at the orchard end. Dismount thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation, for thy assailant is quick, skilful, and deadly.  VIOLA. You mistake, sir; I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me. My remembrance is very free and clear from any image of offence done to any man.  SIR TOBY. You’ll find it otherwise, I assure you. Therefore, if you hold your life at any price, betake you to your guard, for your opposite hath in him what youth, strength, skill, and wrath, can furnish man withal.  VIOLA. I pray you, sir, what is he?  SIR TOBY. He is knight, dubbed with unhatched rapier, and on carpet consideration, but he is a devil in private brawl. Souls and bodies hath he divorced three, and his incensement at this moment is so implacable that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death and sepulchre. Hob, nob is his word; give’t or take’t.  VIOLA. I will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady. I am no fighter. I have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others to taste their valour: belike this is a man of that quirk.  SIR TOBY. Sir, no. His indignation derives itself out of a very competent injury; therefore, get you on and give him his desire. Back you shall not to the house, unless you undertake that with me which with as much safety you might answer him. Therefore on, or strip your sword stark naked, for meddle you must, that’s certain, or forswear to wear iron about you.  VIOLA. This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you, do me this courteous office, as to know of the knight what my offence to him is. It is something of my negligence, nothing of my purpose.  SIR TOBY. I will do so. Signior Fabian, stay you by this gentleman till my return.   [_Exit Sir Toby._]  VIOLA. Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter?  FABIAN. I know the knight is incensed against you, even to a mortal arbitrement, but nothing of the circumstance more.  VIOLA. I beseech you, what manner of man is he?  FABIAN. Nothing of that wonderful promise, to read him by his form, as you are like to find him in the proof of his valour. He is indeed, sir, the most skilful, bloody, and fatal opposite that you could possibly have found in any part of Illyria. Will you walk towards him? I will make your peace with him if I can.  VIOLA. I shall be much bound to you for’t. I am one that had rather go with sir priest than sir knight: I care not who knows so much of my mettle.   [_Exeunt._]   Enter Sir Toby and Sir Andrew.  SIR TOBY. Why, man, he’s a very devil. I have not seen such a firago. I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard, and all, and he gives me the stuck-in with such a mortal motion that it is inevitable; and on the answer, he pays you as surely as your feet hits the ground they step on. They say he has been fencer to the Sophy.  SIR ANDREW. Pox on’t, I’ll not meddle with him.  SIR TOBY. Ay, but he will not now be pacified: Fabian can scarce hold him yonder.  SIR ANDREW. Plague on’t, an I thought he had been valiant, and so cunning in fence, I’d have seen him damned ere I’d have challenged him. Let him let the matter slip, and I’ll give him my horse, grey Capilet.  SIR TOBY. I’ll make the motion. Stand here, make a good show on’t. This shall end without the perdition of souls. [_Aside._] Marry, I’ll ride your horse as well as I ride you.   Enter Fabian and Viola.  [_To Fabian._] I have his horse to take up the quarrel. I have persuaded him the youth’s a devil.  FABIAN. He is as horribly conceited of him, and pants and looks pale, as if a bear were at his heels.  SIR TOBY. There’s no remedy, sir, he will fight with you for’s oath sake. Marry, he hath better bethought him of his quarrel, and he finds that now scarce to be worth talking of. Therefore, draw for the supportance of his vow; he protests he will not hurt you.  VIOLA. [_Aside._] Pray God defend me! A little thing would make me tell them how much I lack of a man.  FABIAN. Give ground if you see him furious.  SIR TOBY. Come, Sir Andrew, there’s no remedy, the gentleman will for his honour’s sake have one bout with you. He cannot by the duello avoid it; but he has promised me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier, he will not hurt you. Come on: to’t.  SIR ANDREW. [_Draws._] Pray God he keep his oath!   Enter Antonio.  VIOLA. [_Draws._] I do assure you ’tis against my will.  ANTONIO. Put up your sword. If this young gentleman Have done offence, I take the fault on me. If you offend him, I for him defy you.  SIR TOBY. You, sir? Why, what are you?  ANTONIO. [_Draws._] One, sir, that for his love dares yet do more Than you have heard him brag to you he will.  SIR TOBY. [_Draws._] Nay, if you be an undertaker, I am for you.   Enter Officers.  FABIAN. O good Sir Toby, hold! Here come the officers.  SIR TOBY. [_To Antonio._] I’ll be with you anon.  VIOLA. [_To Sir Andrew._] Pray, sir, put your sword up, if you please.  SIR ANDREW. Marry, will I, sir; and for that I promised you, I’ll be as good as my word. He will bear you easily, and reins well.  FIRST OFFICER. This is the man; do thy office.  SECOND OFFICER. Antonio, I arrest thee at the suit Of Count Orsino.  ANTONIO. You do mistake me, sir.  FIRST OFFICER. No, sir, no jot. I know your favour well, Though now you have no sea-cap on your head.— Take him away, he knows I know him well.  ANTONIO. I must obey. This comes with seeking you; But there’s no remedy, I shall answer it. What will you do? Now my necessity Makes me to ask you for my purse. It grieves me Much more for what I cannot do for you, Than what befalls myself. You stand amaz’d, But be of comfort.  SECOND OFFICER. Come, sir, away.  ANTONIO. I must entreat of you some of that money.  VIOLA. What money, sir? For the fair kindness you have show’d me here, And part being prompted by your present trouble, Out of my lean and low ability I’ll lend you something. My having is not much; I’ll make division of my present with you. Hold, there’s half my coffer.  ANTONIO. Will you deny me now? Is’t possible that my deserts to you Can lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery, Lest that it make me so unsound a man As to upbraid you with those kindnesses That I have done for you.  VIOLA. I know of none, Nor know I you by voice or any feature. I hate ingratitude more in a man Than lying, vainness, babbling, drunkenness, Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption Inhabits our frail blood.  ANTONIO. O heavens themselves!  SECOND OFFICER. Come, sir, I pray you go.  ANTONIO. Let me speak a little. This youth that you see here I snatch’d one half out of the jaws of death, Reliev’d him with such sanctity of love; And to his image, which methought did promise Most venerable worth, did I devotion.  FIRST OFFICER. What’s that to us? The time goes by. Away!  ANTONIO. But O how vile an idol proves this god! Thou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame. In nature there’s no blemish but the mind; None can be call’d deform’d but the unkind. Virtue is beauty, but the beauteous evil Are empty trunks, o’erflourished by the devil.  FIRST OFFICER. The man grows mad, away with him. Come, come, sir.  ANTONIO. Lead me on.   [_Exeunt Officers with Antonio._]  VIOLA. Methinks his words do from such passion fly That he believes himself; so do not I. Prove true, imagination, O prove true, That I, dear brother, be now ta’en for you!  SIR TOBY. Come hither, knight; come hither, Fabian. We’ll whisper o’er a couplet or two of most sage saws.  VIOLA. He nam’d Sebastian. I my brother know Yet living in my glass; even such and so In favour was my brother, and he went Still in this fashion, colour, ornament, For him I imitate. O if it prove, Tempests are kind, and salt waves fresh in love!   [_Exit._]  SIR TOBY. A very dishonest paltry boy, and more a coward than a hare. His dishonesty appears in leaving his friend here in necessity, and denying him; and for his cowardship, ask Fabian.  FABIAN. A coward, a most devout coward, religious in it.  SIR ANDREW. ’Slid, I’ll after him again and beat him.  SIR TOBY. Do, cuff him soundly, but never draw thy sword.  SIR ANDREW. And I do not—   [_Exit._]  FABIAN. Come, let’s see the event.  SIR TOBY. I dare lay any money ’twill be nothing yet.   [_Exeunt._]
  ACT IV.  SCENE I. The Street before Olivia’s House.
 Enter Sebastian and Clown.  CLOWN. Will you make me believe that I am not sent for you?  SEBASTIAN. Go to, go to, thou art a foolish fellow. Let me be clear of thee.  CLOWN. Well held out, i’ faith! No, I do not know you, nor I am not sent to you by my lady, to bid you come speak with her; nor your name is not Master Cesario; nor this is not my nose neither. Nothing that is so, is so.  SEBASTIAN. I prithee vent thy folly somewhere else, Thou know’st not me.  CLOWN. Vent my folly! He has heard that word of some great man, and now applies it to a fool. Vent my folly! I am afraid this great lubber, the world, will prove a cockney. I prithee now, ungird thy strangeness, and tell me what I shall vent to my lady. Shall I vent to her that thou art coming?  SEBASTIAN. I prithee, foolish Greek, depart from me. There’s money for thee; if you tarry longer I shall give worse payment.  CLOWN. By my troth, thou hast an open hand. These wise men that give fools money get themselves a good report—after fourteen years’ purchase.   Enter Sir Andrew, Sir Toby and Fabian.  SIR ANDREW. Now sir, have I met you again? There’s for you.   [_Striking Sebastian._]  SEBASTIAN. Why, there’s for thee, and there, and there. Are all the people mad?   [_Beating Sir Andrew._]  SIR TOBY. Hold, sir, or I’ll throw your dagger o’er the house.  CLOWN. This will I tell my lady straight. I would not be in some of your coats for twopence.   [_Exit Clown._]  SIR TOBY. Come on, sir, hold!  SIR ANDREW. Nay, let him alone, I’ll go another way to work with him. I’ll have an action of battery against him, if there be any law in Illyria. Though I struck him first, yet it’s no matter for that.  SEBASTIAN. Let go thy hand!  SIR TOBY. Come, sir, I will not let you go. Come, my young soldier, put up your iron: you are well fleshed. Come on.  SEBASTIAN. I will be free from thee. What wouldst thou now? If thou dar’st tempt me further, draw thy sword.   [_Draws._]  SIR TOBY. What, what? Nay, then, I must have an ounce or two of this malapert blood from you.   [_Draws._]   Enter Olivia.  OLIVIA. Hold, Toby! On thy life I charge thee hold!  SIR TOBY. Madam.  OLIVIA. Will it be ever thus? Ungracious wretch, Fit for the mountains and the barbarous caves, Where manners ne’er were preach’d! Out of my sight! Be not offended, dear Cesario. Rudesby, be gone!   [_Exeunt Sir Toby, Sir Andrew and Fabian._]  I prithee, gentle friend, Let thy fair wisdom, not thy passion, sway In this uncivil and unjust extent Against thy peace. Go with me to my house, And hear thou there how many fruitless pranks This ruffian hath botch’d up, that thou thereby Mayst smile at this. Thou shalt not choose but go. Do not deny. Beshrew his soul for me, He started one poor heart of mine, in thee.  SEBASTIAN. What relish is in this? How runs the stream? Or I am mad, or else this is a dream. Let fancy still my sense in Lethe steep; If it be thus to dream, still let me sleep!  OLIVIA. Nay, come, I prithee. Would thou’dst be ruled by me!  SEBASTIAN. Madam, I will.  OLIVIA. O, say so, and so be!   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. A Room in Olivia’s House.   Enter Maria and Clown.  MARIA. Nay, I prithee, put on this gown and this beard; make him believe thou art Sir Topas the curate. Do it quickly. I’ll call Sir Toby the whilst.   [_Exit Maria._]  CLOWN. Well, I’ll put it on, and I will dissemble myself in’t, and I would I were the first that ever dissembled in such a gown. I am not tall enough to become the function well, nor lean enough to be thought a good student, but to be said, an honest man and a good housekeeper goes as fairly as to say, a careful man and a great scholar. The competitors enter.   Enter Sir Toby and Maria.  SIR TOBY. Jove bless thee, Master Parson.  CLOWN. _Bonos dies_, Sir Toby: for as the old hermit of Prague, that never saw pen and ink, very wittily said to a niece of King Gorboduc, ‘That that is, is’: so I, being Master Parson, am Master Parson; for what is ‘that’ but ‘that’? and ‘is’ but ‘is’?  SIR TOBY. To him, Sir Topas.  CLOWN. What ho, I say! Peace in this prison!  SIR TOBY. The knave counterfeits well. A good knave.  Malvolio within.  MALVOLIO. Who calls there?  CLOWN. Sir Topas the curate, who comes to visit Malvolio the lunatic.  MALVOLIO. Sir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, go to my lady.  CLOWN. Out, hyperbolical fiend! how vexest thou this man? Talkest thou nothing but of ladies?  SIR TOBY. Well said, Master Parson.  MALVOLIO. Sir Topas, never was man thus wronged. Good Sir Topas, do not think I am mad. They have laid me here in hideous darkness.  CLOWN. Fie, thou dishonest Satan! I call thee by the most modest terms, for I am one of those gentle ones that will use the devil himself with courtesy. Say’st thou that house is dark?  MALVOLIO. As hell, Sir Topas.  CLOWN. Why, it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes, and the clerestories toward the south-north are as lustrous as ebony; and yet complainest thou of obstruction?  MALVOLIO. I am not mad, Sir Topas. I say to you this house is dark.  CLOWN. Madman, thou errest. I say there is no darkness but ignorance, in which thou art more puzzled than the Egyptians in their fog.  MALVOLIO. I say this house is as dark as ignorance, though ignorance were as dark as hell; and I say there was never man thus abused. I am no more mad than you are. Make the trial of it in any constant question.  CLOWN. What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wildfowl?  MALVOLIO. That the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird.  CLOWN. What think’st thou of his opinion?  MALVOLIO. I think nobly of the soul, and no way approve his opinion.  CLOWN. Fare thee well. Remain thou still in darkness. Thou shalt hold the opinion of Pythagoras ere I will allow of thy wits, and fear to kill a woodcock, lest thou dispossess the soul of thy grandam. Fare thee well.  MALVOLIO. Sir Topas, Sir Topas!  SIR TOBY. My most exquisite Sir Topas!  CLOWN. Nay, I am for all waters.  MARIA. Thou mightst have done this without thy beard and gown. He sees thee not.  SIR TOBY. To him in thine own voice, and bring me word how thou find’st him. I would we were well rid of this knavery. If he may be conveniently delivered, I would he were, for I am now so far in offence with my niece that I cannot pursue with any safety this sport to the upshot. Come by and by to my chamber.   [_Exeunt Sir Toby and Maria._]  CLOWN. [_Singing._]     _Hey, Robin, jolly Robin,     Tell me how thy lady does._  MALVOLIO. Fool!  CLOWN.     _My lady is unkind, perdy._  MALVOLIO. Fool!  CLOWN.     _Alas, why is she so?_  MALVOLIO. Fool, I say!  CLOWN.     _She loves another_— Who calls, ha?  MALVOLIO. Good fool, as ever thou wilt deserve well at my hand, help me to a candle, and pen, ink, and paper. As I am a gentleman, I will live to be thankful to thee for’t.  CLOWN. Master Malvolio?  MALVOLIO. Ay, good fool.  CLOWN. Alas, sir, how fell you besides your five wits?  MALVOLIO. Fool, there was never man so notoriously abused. I am as well in my wits, fool, as thou art.  CLOWN. But as well? Then you are mad indeed, if you be no better in your wits than a fool.  MALVOLIO. They have here propertied me; keep me in darkness, send ministers to me, asses, and do all they can to face me out of my wits.  CLOWN. Advise you what you say: the minister is here. [_As Sir Topas_] Malvolio, Malvolio, thy wits the heavens restore. Endeavour thyself to sleep, and leave thy vain bibble-babble.  MALVOLIO. Sir Topas!  CLOWN. [_As Sir Topas_] Maintain no words with him, good fellow. [_As himself_] Who, I, sir? not I, sir. God buy you, good Sir Topas. [_As Sir Topas_] Marry, amen. [_As himself_] I will sir, I will.  MALVOLIO. Fool, fool, fool, I say!  CLOWN. Alas, sir, be patient. What say you, sir? I am shent for speaking to you.  MALVOLIO. Good fool, help me to some light and some paper. I tell thee I am as well in my wits as any man in Illyria.  CLOWN. Well-a-day that you were, sir!  MALVOLIO. By this hand, I am. Good fool, some ink, paper, and light, and convey what I will set down to my lady. It shall advantage thee more than ever the bearing of letter did.  CLOWN. I will help you to’t. But tell me true, are you not mad indeed? or do you but counterfeit?  MALVOLIO. Believe me, I am not. I tell thee true.  CLOWN. Nay, I’ll ne’er believe a madman till I see his brains. I will fetch you light, and paper, and ink.  MALVOLIO. Fool, I’ll requite it in the highest degree: I prithee be gone.  CLOWN. [_Singing._]   _I am gone, sir, and anon, sir,     I’ll be with you again,   In a trice, like to the old Vice,     Your need to sustain;   Who with dagger of lath, in his rage and his wrath,     Cries ‘ah, ha!’ to the devil:   Like a mad lad, ‘Pare thy nails, dad.     Adieu, goodman devil.’_   [_Exit._]  SCENE III. Olivia’s Garden.   Enter Sebastian.  SEBASTIAN. This is the air; that is the glorious sun, This pearl she gave me, I do feel’t and see’t, And though ’tis wonder that enwraps me thus, Yet ’tis not madness. Where’s Antonio, then? I could not find him at the Elephant, Yet there he was, and there I found this credit, That he did range the town to seek me out. His counsel now might do me golden service. For though my soul disputes well with my sense That this may be some error, but no madness, Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune So far exceed all instance, all discourse, That I am ready to distrust mine eyes And wrangle with my reason that persuades me To any other trust but that I am mad, Or else the lady’s mad; yet if ’twere so, She could not sway her house, command her followers, Take and give back affairs and their dispatch, With such a smooth, discreet, and stable bearing As I perceive she does. There’s something in’t That is deceivable. But here the lady comes.   Enter Olivia and a Priest.  OLIVIA. Blame not this haste of mine. If you mean well, Now go with me and with this holy man Into the chantry by: there, before him And underneath that consecrated roof, Plight me the full assurance of your faith, That my most jealous and too doubtful soul May live at peace. He shall conceal it Whiles you are willing it shall come to note, What time we will our celebration keep According to my birth. What do you say?  SEBASTIAN. I’ll follow this good man, and go with you, And having sworn truth, ever will be true.  OLIVIA. Then lead the way, good father, and heavens so shine, That they may fairly note this act of mine!   [_Exeunt._]

  Dramatis Personæ  DUKE OF MILAN, father to Silvia VALENTINE, one of the two gentlemen PROTEUS, one of the two gentlemen ANTONIO, father to Proteus THURIO, a foolish rival to Valentine EGLAMOUR, agent for Silvia in her escape SPEED, a clownish servant to Valentine LANCE, the like to Proteus PANTINO, servant to Antonio HOST, where Julia lodges in Milan OUTLAWS, with Valentine  JULIA, a lady of Verona, beloved of Proteus SILVIA, beloved of Valentine LUCETTA, waiting-woman to Julia  Servants, Musicians  SCENE: Verona; Milan; the frontiers of Mantua
  ACT I  SCENE I. Verona. An open place
Enter Valentine and Proteus.  VALENTINE. Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus. Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits. Were’t not affection chains thy tender days To the sweet glances of thy honoured love, I rather would entreat thy company To see the wonders of the world abroad Than, living dully sluggardized at home, Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness. But since thou lov’st, love still, and thrive therein, Even as I would when I to love begin.  PROTEUS. Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu. Think on thy Proteus when thou haply seest Some rare noteworthy object in thy travel. Wish me partaker in thy happiness When thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger, If ever danger do environ thee, Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers, For I will be thy headsman, Valentine.  VALENTINE. And on a love-book pray for my success?  PROTEUS. Upon some book I love I’ll pray for thee.  VALENTINE. That’s on some shallow story of deep love, How young Leander crossed the Hellespont.  PROTEUS. That’s a deep story of a deeper love, For he was more than over shoes in love.  VALENTINE. ’Tis true; for you are over boots in love, And yet you never swam the Hellespont.  PROTEUS. Over the boots? Nay, give me not the boots.  VALENTINE. No, I will not, for it boots thee not.  PROTEUS. What?  VALENTINE. To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans, Coy looks with heart-sore sighs, one fading moment’s mirth With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights. If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain; If lost, why then a grievous labour won; However, but a folly bought with wit, Or else a wit by folly vanquished.  PROTEUS. So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.  VALENTINE. So, by your circumstance, I fear you’ll prove.  PROTEUS. ’Tis love you cavil at. I am not Love.  VALENTINE. Love is your master, for he masters you; And he that is so yoked by a fool Methinks should not be chronicled for wise.  PROTEUS. Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud The eating canker dwells, so eating love Inhabits in the finest wits of all.  VALENTINE. And writers say, as the most forward bud Is eaten by the canker ere it blow, Even so by love the young and tender wit Is turned to folly, blasting in the bud, Losing his verdure even in the prime, And all the fair effects of future hopes. But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee That art a votary to fond desire? Once more adieu. My father at the road Expects my coming, there to see me shipped.  PROTEUS. And thither will I bring thee, Valentine.  VALENTINE. Sweet Proteus, no. Now let us take our leave. To Milan let me hear from thee by letters Of thy success in love, and what news else Betideth here in absence of thy friend; And I likewise will visit thee with mine.  PROTEUS. All happiness bechance to thee in Milan.  VALENTINE. As much to you at home, and so farewell.  [_Exit._]  PROTEUS. He after honour hunts, I after love. He leaves his friends to dignify them more; I leave myself, my friends, and all for love. Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphosed me, Made me neglect my studies, lose my time, War with good counsel, set the world at nought; Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.  Enter Speed.  SPEED. Sir Proteus, ’save you. Saw you my master?  PROTEUS. But now he parted hence to embark for Milan.  SPEED. Twenty to one, then, he is shipped already, And I have played the sheep in losing him.  PROTEUS. Indeed a sheep doth very often stray, An if the shepherd be a while away.  SPEED. You conclude that my master is a shepherd then, and I a sheep?  PROTEUS. I do.  SPEED. Why then, my horns are his horns, whether I wake or sleep.  PROTEUS. A silly answer, and fitting well a sheep.  SPEED. This proves me still a sheep.  PROTEUS. True, and thy master a shepherd.  SPEED. Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance.  PROTEUS. It shall go hard but I’ll prove it by another.  SPEED. The shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the sheep the shepherd; but I seek my master, and my master seeks not me. Therefore I am no sheep.  PROTEUS. The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd; the shepherd for food follows not the sheep. Thou for wages followest thy master; thy master for wages follows not thee. Therefore thou art a sheep.  SPEED. Such another proof will make me cry “baa”.  PROTEUS. But dost thou hear? Gav’st thou my letter to Julia?  SPEED. Ay, sir. I, a lost mutton, gave your letter to her, a laced mutton, and she, a laced mutton, gave me, a lost mutton, nothing for my labour.  PROTEUS. Here’s too small a pasture for such store of muttons.  SPEED. If the ground be overcharged, you were best stick her.  PROTEUS. Nay, in that you are astray; ’twere best pound you.  SPEED. Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for carrying your letter.  PROTEUS. You mistake; I mean the pound, a pinfold.  SPEED. From a pound to a pin? Fold it over and over, ’Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to your lover.  PROTEUS. But what said she?  SPEED. [_Nods his head_.] Ay.  PROTEUS. Nod—“Ay”. Why, that’s “noddy”.  SPEED. You mistook, sir. I say she did nod, and you ask me if she did nod; and I say “Ay”.  PROTEUS. And that set together is “noddy”.  SPEED. Now you have taken the pains to set it together, take it for your pains.  PROTEUS. No, no, you shall have it for bearing the letter.  SPEED. Well, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you.  PROTEUS. Why, sir, how do you bear with me?  SPEED. Marry, sir, the letter, very orderly, having nothing but the word “noddy” for my pains.  PROTEUS. Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit.  SPEED. And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.  PROTEUS. Come, come, open the matter; in brief, what said she?  SPEED. Open your purse, that the money and the matter may be both at once delivered.  PROTEUS. [_Giving him a coin_.] Well, sir, here is for your pains. What said she?  SPEED. Truly, sir, I think you’ll hardly win her.  PROTEUS. Why? Couldst thou perceive so much from her?  SPEED. Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her; no, not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter. And being so hard to me that brought your mind, I fear she’ll prove as hard to you in telling your mind. Give her no token but stones, for she’s as hard as steel.  PROTEUS. What said she, nothing?  SPEED. No, not so much as “Take this for thy pains.” To testify your bounty, I thank you, you have testerned me; in requital whereof, henceforth carry your letters yourself. And so, sir, I’ll commend you to my master.  PROTEUS. Go, go, begone, to save your ship from wrack, Which cannot perish having thee aboard, Being destined to a drier death on shore.  [_Exit Speed._]
I must go send some better messenger. I fear my Julia would not deign my lines, Receiving them from such a worthless post.  [_Exit._]  SCENE II. The same. The garden of Julia’s house  Enter Julia and Lucetta.  JULIA. But say, Lucetta, now we are alone, Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love?  LUCETTA. Ay, madam, so you stumble not unheedfully.  JULIA. Of all the fair resort of gentlemen That every day with parle encounter me, In thy opinion which is worthiest love?  LUCETTA. Please you, repeat their names, I’ll show my mind According to my shallow simple skill.  JULIA. What think’st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour?  LUCETTA. As of a knight well-spoken, neat, and fine; But, were I you, he never should be mine.  JULIA. What think’st thou of the rich Mercatio?  LUCETTA. Well of his wealth; but of himself, so-so.  JULIA. What think’st thou of the gentle Proteus?  LUCETTA. Lord, Lord, to see what folly reigns in us!  JULIA. How now? What means this passion at his name?  LUCETTA. Pardon, dear madam, ’tis a passing shame That I, unworthy body as I am, Should censure thus on lovely gentlemen.  JULIA. Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest?  LUCETTA. Then thus: of many good I think him best.  JULIA. Your reason?  LUCETTA. I have no other but a woman’s reason: I think him so because I think him so.  JULIA. And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?  LUCETTA. Ay, if you thought your love not cast away.  JULIA. Why, he of all the rest hath never moved me.  LUCETTA. Yet he of all the rest I think best loves ye.  JULIA. His little speaking shows his love but small.  LUCETTA. Fire that’s closest kept burns most of all.  JULIA. They do not love that do not show their love.  LUCETTA. O, they love least that let men know their love.  JULIA. I would I knew his mind.  LUCETTA. Peruse this paper, madam.  [_Gives her a letter._]  JULIA. _To Julia_—Say, from whom?  LUCETTA. That the contents will show.  JULIA. Say, say, who gave it thee?  LUCETTA. Sir Valentine’s page, and sent, I think, from Proteus. He would have given it you, but I, being in the way, Did in your name receive it. Pardon the fault, I pray.  JULIA. Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker! Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines? To whisper and conspire against my youth? Now trust me, ’tis an office of great worth, And you an officer fit for the place. There, take the paper; see it be returned, Or else return no more into my sight.  LUCETTA. To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.  JULIA. Will ye be gone?  LUCETTA. That you may ruminate.  [_Exit._]  JULIA. And yet I would I had o’erlooked the letter. It were a shame to call her back again And pray her to a fault for which I chid her. What fool is she, that knows I am a maid And would not force the letter to my view, Since maids in modesty say “No” to that Which they would have the profferer construe “Ay”. Fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love That like a testy babe will scratch the nurse And presently, all humbled, kiss the rod! How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence, When willingly I would have had her here! How angerly I taught my brow to frown, When inward joy enforced my heart to smile! My penance is to call Lucetta back And ask remission for my folly past. What ho! Lucetta!  Enter Lucetta.  LUCETTA. What would your ladyship?  JULIA. Is ’t near dinner time?  LUCETTA. I would it were, That you might kill your stomach on your meat And not upon your maid.  [_Drops and picks up the letter._]  JULIA. What is’t that you took up so gingerly?  LUCETTA. Nothing.  JULIA. Why didst thou stoop, then?  LUCETTA. To take a paper up that I let fall.  JULIA. And is that paper nothing?  LUCETTA. Nothing concerning me.  JULIA. Then let it lie for those that it concerns.  LUCETTA. Madam, it will not lie where it concerns, Unless it have a false interpreter.  JULIA. Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.  LUCETTA. That I might sing it, madam, to a tune. Give me a note. Your ladyship can set—  JULIA. As little by such toys as may be possible. Best sing it to the tune of “Light o’ Love”.  LUCETTA. It is too heavy for so light a tune.  JULIA. Heavy? Belike it hath some burden then?  LUCETTA. Ay, and melodious were it, would you sing it.  JULIA. And why not you?  LUCETTA. I cannot reach so high.  JULIA. Let’s see your song. [_Taking the letter_.] How now, minion!  LUCETTA. Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out. And yet methinks I do not like this tune.  JULIA. You do not?  LUCETTA. No, madam, it is too sharp.  JULIA. You, minion, are too saucy.  LUCETTA. Nay, now you are too flat And mar the concord with too harsh a descant. There wanteth but a mean to fill your song.  JULIA. The mean is drowned with your unruly bass.  LUCETTA. Indeed, I bid the base for Proteus.  JULIA. This babble shall not henceforth trouble me. Here is a coil with protestation! [_Tears the letter_.] Go, get you gone, and let the papers lie. You would be fingering them to anger me.  LUCETTA. She makes it strange, but she would be best pleased To be so angered with another letter.  [_Exit._]  JULIA. Nay, would I were so angered with the same! O hateful hands, to tear such loving words! Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey And kill the bees that yield it with your stings! I’ll kiss each several paper for amends. Look, here is writ _kind Julia_. Unkind Julia! As in revenge of thy ingratitude, I throw thy name against the bruising stones, Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain. And here is writ _love-wounded Proteus_. Poor wounded name, my bosom as a bed Shall lodge thee till thy wound be throughly healed; And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss. But twice or thrice was _Proteus_ written down. Be calm, good wind, blow not a word away Till I have found each letter in the letter Except mine own name. That some whirlwind bear Unto a ragged, fearful, hanging rock, And throw it thence into the raging sea. Lo, here in one line is his name twice writ: _Poor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus, To the sweet Julia._ That I’ll tear away; And yet I will not, sith so prettily He couples it to his complaining names. Thus will I fold them one upon another. Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will.  Enter Lucetta.  LUCETTA. Madam, dinner is ready, and your father stays.  JULIA. Well, let us go.  LUCETTA. What, shall these papers lie like tell-tales here?  JULIA. If you respect them, best to take them up.  LUCETTA. Nay, I was taken up for laying them down. Yet here they shall not lie, for catching cold.  [_Picks up pieces of the letter._]  JULIA. I see you have a month’s mind to them.  LUCETTA. Ay, madam, you may say what sights you see; I see things too, although you judge I wink.  JULIA. Come, come, will’t please you go?  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. The same. A room in Antonio’s house  Enter Antonio and Pantino.  ANTONIO. Tell me, Pantino, what sad talk was that Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister?  PANTINO. ’Twas of his nephew Proteus, your son.  ANTONIO. Why, what of him?  PANTINO. He wondered that your lordship Would suffer him to spend his youth at home While other men, of slender reputation, Put forth their sons to seek preferment out: Some to the wars to try their fortune there; Some to discover islands far away; Some to the studious universities. For any or for all these exercises He said that Proteus your son was meet, And did request me to importune you To let him spend his time no more at home, Which would be great impeachment to his age In having known no travel in his youth.  ANTONIO. Nor need’st thou much importune me to that Whereon this month I have been hammering. I have considered well his loss of time, And how he cannot be a perfect man, Not being tried and tutored in the world. Experience is by industry achieved And perfected by the swift course of time. Then tell me whither were I best to send him?  PANTINO. I think your lordship is not ignorant How his companion, youthful Valentine, Attends the Emperor in his royal court.  ANTONIO. I know it well.  PANTINO. ’Twere good, I think, your lordship sent him thither. There shall he practise tilts and tournaments, Hear sweet discourse, converse with noblemen, And be in eye of every exercise Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth.  ANTONIO. I like thy counsel; well hast thou advised, And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it, The execution of it shall make known. Even with the speediest expedition I will dispatch him to the Emperor’s court.  PANTINO. Tomorrow, may it please you, Don Alphonso With other gentlemen of good esteem Are journeying to salute the Emperor And to commend their service to his will.  ANTONIO. Good company. With them shall Proteus go.  Enter Proteus reading a letter.  And in good time! Now will we break with him.  PROTEUS. Sweet love, sweet lines, sweet life! Here is her hand, the agent of her heart; Here is her oath for love, her honour’s pawn. O, that our fathers would applaud our loves To seal our happiness with their consents. O heavenly Julia!  ANTONIO. How now? What letter are you reading there?  PROTEUS. May’t please your lordship, ’tis a word or two Of commendations sent from Valentine, Delivered by a friend that came from him.  ANTONIO. Lend me the letter. Let me see what news.  PROTEUS. There is no news, my lord, but that he writes How happily he lives, how well beloved And daily graced by the Emperor, Wishing me with him, partner of his fortune.  ANTONIO. And how stand you affected to his wish?  PROTEUS. As one relying on your lordship’s will, And not depending on his friendly wish.  ANTONIO. My will is something sorted with his wish. Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed, For what I will, I will, and there an end. I am resolved that thou shalt spend some time With Valentinus in the Emperor’s court. What maintenance he from his friends receives, Like exhibition thou shalt have from me. Tomorrow be in readiness to go. Excuse it not, for I am peremptory.  PROTEUS. My lord, I cannot be so soon provided; Please you deliberate a day or two.  ANTONIO. Look what thou want’st shall be sent after thee. No more of stay. Tomorrow thou must go. Come on, Pantino, you shall be employed To hasten on his expedition.  [_Exeunt Antonio and Pantino._]  PROTEUS. Thus have I shunned the fire for fear of burning And drenched me in the sea, where I am drowned. I feared to show my father Julia’s letter Lest he should take exceptions to my love, And with the vantage of mine own excuse Hath he excepted most against my love. O, how this spring of love resembleth The uncertain glory of an April day, Which now shows all the beauty of the sun, And by an by a cloud takes all away.  Enter Pantino.  PANTINO. Sir Proteus, your father calls for you. He is in haste. Therefore, I pray you, go.  PROTEUS. Why, this it is: my heart accords thereto, And yet a thousand times it answers “No”.  [_Exeunt._]
  ACT II  SCENE I. Milan. A room in the Duke’s palace
  ACT III  SCENE I. Milan. An anteroom in the Duke’s palace
Enter Duke, Thurio and Proteus.  DUKE. Sir Thurio, give us leave, I pray, awhile; We have some secrets to confer about.  [_Exit Thurio._]  Now tell me, Proteus, what’s your will with me?  PROTEUS. My gracious lord, that which I would discover The law of friendship bids me to conceal, But when I call to mind your gracious favours Done to me, undeserving as I am, My duty pricks me on to utter that Which else no worldly good should draw from me. Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine my friend This night intends to steal away your daughter; Myself am one made privy to the plot. I know you have determined to bestow her On Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates, And should she thus be stol’n away from you, It would be much vexation to your age. Thus, for my duty’s sake, I rather chose To cross my friend in his intended drift Than, by concealing it, heap on your head A pack of sorrows which would press you down, Being unprevented, to your timeless grave.  DUKE. Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care, Which to requite command me while I live. This love of theirs myself have often seen, Haply when they have judged me fast asleep, And oftentimes have purposed to forbid Sir Valentine her company and my court. But fearing lest my jealous aim might err And so, unworthily, disgrace the man— A rashness that I ever yet have shunned— I gave him gentle looks, thereby to find That which thyself hast now disclosed to me. And that thou mayst perceive my fear of this, Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested, I nightly lodge her in an upper tower, The key whereof myself have ever kept; And thence she cannot be conveyed away.  PROTEUS. Know, noble lord, they have devised a mean How he her chamber-window will ascend And with a corded ladder fetch her down; For which the youthful lover now is gone, And this way comes he with it presently, Where, if it please you, you may intercept him. But, good my lord, do it so cunningly That my discovery be not aimed at; For love of you, not hate unto my friend, Hath made me publisher of this pretence.  DUKE. Upon mine honour, he shall never know That I had any light from thee of this.  PROTEUS. Adieu, my lord, Sir Valentine is coming.  [_Exit._]  Enter Valentine.  DUKE. Sir Valentine, whither away so fast?  VALENTINE. Please it your Grace, there is a messenger That stays to bear my letters to my friends, And I am going to deliver them.  DUKE. Be they of much import?  VALENTINE. The tenor of them doth but signify My health and happy being at your court.  DUKE. Nay then, no matter. Stay with me awhile; I am to break with thee of some affairs That touch me near, wherein thou must be secret. ’Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter.  VALENTINE. I know it well, my lord, and sure the match Were rich and honourable. Besides, the gentleman Is full of virtue, bounty, worth, and qualities Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter. Cannot your grace win her to fancy him?  DUKE. No, trust me, she is peevish, sullen, froward, Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty, Neither regarding that she is my child Nor fearing me as if I were her father; And, may I say to thee, this pride of hers, Upon advice, hath drawn my love from her, And where I thought the remnant of mine age Should have been cherished by her childlike duty, I now am full resolved to take a wife And turn her out to who will take her in. Then let her beauty be her wedding dower, For me and my possessions she esteems not.  VALENTINE. What would your Grace have me to do in this?  DUKE. There is a lady of Verona here Whom I affect; but she is nice, and coy, And nought esteems my aged eloquence. Now therefore would I have thee to my tutor— For long agone I have forgot to court; Besides, the fashion of the time is changed— How and which way I may bestow myself To be regarded in her sun-bright eye.  VALENTINE. Win her with gifts if she respect not words; Dumb jewels often in their silent kind More than quick words do move a woman’s mind.  DUKE. But she did scorn a present that I sent her.  VALENTINE. A woman sometime scorns what best contents her. Send her another; never give her o’er, For scorn at first makes after-love the more. If she do frown, ’tis not in hate of you, But rather to beget more love in you. If she do chide, ’tis not to have you gone, Forwhy the fools are mad if left alone. Take no repulse, whatever she doth say; For “Get you gone” she doth not mean “Away!” Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces; Though ne’er so black, say they have angels’ faces. That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.  DUKE. But she I mean is promised by her friends Unto a youthful gentleman of worth, And kept severely from resort of men, That no man hath access by day to her.  VALENTINE. Why then, I would resort to her by night.  DUKE. Ay, but the doors be locked and keys kept safe, That no man hath recourse to her by night.  VALENTINE. What lets but one may enter at her window?  DUKE. Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground, And built so shelving that one cannot climb it Without apparent hazard of his life.  VALENTINE. Why, then a ladder quaintly made of cords To cast up with a pair of anchoring hooks, Would serve to scale another Hero’s tower, So bold Leander would adventure it.  DUKE. Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood, Advise me where I may have such a ladder.  VALENTINE. When would you use it? Pray, sir, tell me that.  DUKE. This very night; for Love is like a child That longs for everything that he can come by.  VALENTINE. By seven o’clock I’ll get you such a ladder.  DUKE. But, hark thee: I will go to her alone; How shall I best convey the ladder thither?  VALENTINE. It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it Under a cloak that is of any length.  DUKE. A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?  VALENTINE. Ay, my good lord.  DUKE. Then let me see thy cloak; I’ll get me one of such another length.  VALENTINE. Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.  DUKE. How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak? I pray thee, let me feel thy cloak upon me.  [_Takes Valentine’s cloak and finds a letter and a rope ladder concealed under it._]  What letter is this same? What’s here?—_To Silvia?_ And here an engine fit for my proceeding. I’ll be so bold to break the seal for once.  [_Reads_.] _My thoughts do harbour with my Silvia nightly,     And slaves they are to me that send them flying. O, could their master come and go as lightly,     Himself would lodge where, senseless, they are lying. My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them,     While I, their king, that thither them importune, Do curse the grace that with such grace hath blest them,     Because myself do want my servants’ fortune. I curse myself, for they are sent by me, That they should harbour where their lord should be._ What’s here? [_Reads_.] _Silvia, this night I will enfranchise thee._ ’Tis so; and here’s the ladder for the purpose. Why, Phaëthon—for thou art Merops’ son— Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car, And with thy daring folly burn the world? Wilt thou reach stars because they shine on thee? Go, base intruder, overweening slave, Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates, And think my patience, more than thy desert, Is privilege for thy departure hence. Thank me for this more than for all the favours Which, all too much, I have bestowed on thee. But if thou linger in my territories Longer than swiftest expedition Will give thee time to leave our royal court, By heaven, my wrath shall far exceed the love I ever bore my daughter or thyself. Begone, I will not hear thy vain excuse, But, as thou lov’st thy life, make speed from hence.  [_Exit._]  VALENTINE. And why not death, rather than living torment? To die is to be banished from myself, And Silvia is myself; banished from her Is self from self—a deadly banishment. What light is light, if Silvia be not seen? What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by? Unless it be to think that she is by And feed upon the shadow of perfection. Except I be by Silvia in the night, There is no music in the nightingale. Unless I look on Silvia in the day, There is no day for me to look upon. She is my essence, and I leave to be If I be not by her fair influence Fostered, illumined, cherished, kept alive. I fly not death, to fly his deadly doom: Tarry I here, I but attend on death, But fly I hence, I fly away from life.  Enter Proteus and Lance.  PROTEUS. Run, boy, run, run, seek him out.  LANCE. So-ho, so-ho!  PROTEUS. What seest thou?  LANCE. Him we go to find. There’s not a hair on ’s head but ’tis a Valentine.  PROTEUS. Valentine?  VALENTINE. No.  PROTEUS. Who then? His spirit?  VALENTINE. Neither.  PROTEUS. What then?  VALENTINE. Nothing.  LANCE. Can nothing speak? Master, shall I strike?  PROTEUS. Who wouldst thou strike?  LANCE. Nothing.  PROTEUS. Villain, forbear.  LANCE. Why, sir, I’ll strike nothing. I pray you—  PROTEUS. Sirrah, I say, forbear.—Friend Valentine, a word.  VALENTINE. My ears are stopped and cannot hear good news, So much of bad already hath possessed them.  PROTEUS. Then in dumb silence will I bury mine, For they are harsh, untuneable, and bad.  VALENTINE. Is Silvia dead?  PROTEUS. No, Valentine.  VALENTINE. No Valentine indeed for sacred Silvia. Hath she forsworn me?  PROTEUS. No, Valentine.  VALENTINE. No Valentine, if Silvia have forsworn me. What is your news?  LANCE. Sir, there is a proclamation that you are vanished.  PROTEUS. That thou art banished—O, that’s the news— From hence, from Silvia, and from me thy friend.  VALENTINE. O, I have fed upon this woe already, And now excess of it will make me surfeit. Doth Silvia know that I am banished?  PROTEUS. Ay, ay; and she hath offered to the doom— Which unreversed stands in effectual force— A sea of melting pearl, which some call tears; Those at her father’s churlish feet she tendered, With them, upon her knees, her humble self, Wringing her hands, whose whiteness so became them As if but now they waxed pale for woe. But neither bended knees, pure hands held up, Sad sighs, deep groans, nor silver-shedding tears Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire; But Valentine, if he be ta’en, must die. Besides, her intercession chafed him so, When she for thy repeal was suppliant, That to close prison he commanded her, With many bitter threats of biding there.  VALENTINE. No more, unless the next word that thou speak’st Have some malignant power upon my life. If so, I pray thee breathe it in mine ear, As ending anthem of my endless dolour.  PROTEUS. Cease to lament for that thou canst not help, And study help for that which thou lament’st. Time is the nurse and breeder of all good. Here if thou stay, thou canst not see thy love; Besides, thy staying will abridge thy life. Hope is a lover’s staff; walk hence with that And manage it against despairing thoughts. Thy letters may be here, though thou art hence, Which, being writ to me, shall be delivered Even in the milk-white bosom of thy love. The time now serves not to expostulate. Come, I’ll convey thee through the city-gate, And, ere I part with thee, confer at large Of all that may concern thy love affairs. As thou lov’st Silvia, though not for thyself, Regard thy danger, and along with me.  VALENTINE. I pray thee, Lance, an if thou seest my boy, Bid him make haste and meet me at the North Gate.  PROTEUS. Go, sirrah, find him out. Come, Valentine.  VALENTINE. O, my dear Silvia! Hapless Valentine!  [_Exeunt Valentine and Proteus._]  LANCE. I am but a fool, look you, and yet I have the wit to think my master is a kind of a knave; but that’s all one if he be but one knave. He lives not now that knows me to be in love, yet I am in love, but a team of horse shall not pluck that from me, nor who ’tis I love; and yet ’tis a woman, but what woman I will not tell myself; and yet ’tis a milkmaid; yet ’tis not a maid, for she hath had gossips; yet ’tis a maid, for she is her master’s maid and serves for wages. She hath more qualities than a water-spaniel, which is much in a bare Christian. [_Pulls out a paper_.] Here is the cate-log of her condition. _Imprimis, She can fetch and carry_. Why, a horse can do no more; nay, a horse cannot fetch but only carry; therefore is she better than a jade. _Item, She can milk_. Look you, a sweet virtue in a maid with clean hands.  Enter Speed.  SPEED. How now, Signior Lance? What news with your mastership?  LANCE. With my master’s ship? Why, it is at sea.  SPEED. Well, your old vice still: mistake the word. What news, then, in your paper?  LANCE. The blackest news that ever thou heard’st.  SPEED. Why, man? How black?  LANCE. Why, as black as ink.  SPEED. Let me read them.  LANCE. Fie on thee, jolt-head, thou canst not read.  SPEED. Thou liest. I can.  LANCE. I will try thee. Tell me this, who begot thee?  SPEED. Marry, the son of my grandfather.  LANCE. O, illiterate loiterer! It was the son of thy grandmother. This proves that thou canst not read.  SPEED. Come, fool, come; try me in thy paper.  LANCE. [_Gives him the paper_.] There; and Saint Nicholas be thy speed.  SPEED. _Imprimis, She can milk._  LANCE. Ay, that she can.  SPEED. _Item, She brews good ale._  LANCE. And thereof comes the proverb, “Blessing of your heart, you brew good ale.”  SPEED. _Item, She can sew._  LANCE. That’s as much as to say, “Can she so?”  SPEED. _Item, She can knit._  LANCE. What need a man care for a stock with a wench, when she can knit him a stock?  SPEED. _Item, She can wash and scour._  LANCE. A special virtue, for then she need not be washed and scoured.  SPEED. _Item, She can spin._  LANCE. Then may I set the world on wheels, when she can spin for her living.  SPEED. _Item, She hath many nameless virtues._  LANCE. That’s as much as to say, “bastard virtues”, that indeed know not their fathers, and therefore have no names.  SPEED. Here follow her vices.  LANCE. Close at the heels of her virtues.  SPEED. _Item, She is not to be kissed fasting in respect of her breath._  LANCE. Well, that fault may be mended with a breakfast. Read on.  SPEED. _Item, She hath a sweet mouth._  LANCE. That makes amends for her sour breath.  SPEED. _Item, She doth talk in her sleep._  LANCE. It’s no matter for that, so she sleep not in her talk.  SPEED. _Item, She is slow in words._  LANCE. O villain, that set this down among her vices! To be slow in words is a woman’s only virtue. I pray thee, out with’t, and place it for her chief virtue.  SPEED. _Item, She is proud._  LANCE. Out with that too; it was Eve’s legacy and cannot be ta’en from her.  SPEED. _Item, She hath no teeth._  LANCE. I care not for that neither, because I love crusts.  SPEED. _Item, She is curst._  LANCE. Well, the best is, she hath no teeth to bite.  SPEED. _Item, She will often praise her liquor._  LANCE. If her liquor be good, she shall; if she will not, I will, for good things should be praised.  SPEED. _Item, She is too liberal._  LANCE. Of her tongue she cannot, for that’s writ down she is slow of; of her purse she shall not, for that I’ll keep shut. Now, of another thing she may, and that cannot I help. Well, proceed.  SPEED. _Item, She hath more hair than wit, and more faults than hairs, and more wealth than faults._  LANCE. Stop there; I’ll have her. She was mine and not mine twice or thrice in that last article. Rehearse that once more.  SPEED. _Item, She hath more hair than wit_—  LANCE. More hair than wit. It may be; I’ll prove it: the cover of the salt hides the salt, and therefore it is more than the salt; the hair that covers the wit is more than the wit, for the greater hides the less. What’s next?  SPEED. _And more faults than hairs._  LANCE. That’s monstrous! O, that that were out!  SPEED. _And more wealth than faults._  LANCE. Why, that word makes the faults gracious. Well, I’ll have her; an if it be a match, as nothing is impossible—  SPEED. What then?  LANCE. Why, then will I tell thee that thy master stays for thee at the North Gate.  SPEED. For me?  LANCE. For thee? Ay, who art thou? He hath stayed for a better man than thee.  SPEED. And must I go to him?  LANCE. Thou must run to him, for thou hast stayed so long that going will scarce serve the turn.  SPEED. Why didst not tell me sooner? Pox of your love letters!  [_Exit._]  LANCE. Now will he be swinged for reading my letter; an unmannerly slave, that will thrust himself into secrets. I’ll after, to rejoice in the boy’s correction.  [_Exit._]  SCENE II. The same. A room in the Duke’s palace  Enter Duke and Thurio.  DUKE. Sir Thurio, fear not but that she will love you Now Valentine is banished from her sight.  THURIO. Since his exile she hath despised me most, Forsworn my company and railed at me, That I am desperate of obtaining her.  DUKE. This weak impress of love is as a figure Trenched in ice, which with an hour’s heat Dissolves to water and doth lose his form. A little time will melt her frozen thoughts, And worthless Valentine shall be forgot.  Enter Proteus.  How now, Sir Proteus? Is your countryman, According to our proclamation, gone?  PROTEUS. Gone, my good lord.  DUKE. My daughter takes his going grievously.  PROTEUS. A little time, my lord, will kill that grief.  DUKE. So I believe, but Thurio thinks not so. Proteus, the good conceit I hold of thee, For thou hast shown some sign of good desert, Makes me the better to confer with thee.  PROTEUS. Longer than I prove loyal to your Grace Let me not live to look upon your Grace.  DUKE. Thou know’st how willingly I would effect The match between Sir Thurio and my daughter?  PROTEUS. I do, my lord.  DUKE. And also, I think, thou art not ignorant How she opposes her against my will?  PROTEUS. She did, my lord, when Valentine was here.  DUKE. Ay, and perversely she persevers so. What might we do to make the girl forget The love of Valentine, and love Sir Thurio?  PROTEUS. The best way is to slander Valentine With falsehood, cowardice, and poor descent, Three things that women highly hold in hate.  DUKE. Ay, but she’ll think that it is spoke in hate.  PROTEUS. Ay, if his enemy deliver it; Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken By one whom she esteemeth as his friend.  DUKE. Then you must undertake to slander him.  PROTEUS. And that, my lord, I shall be loath to do. ’Tis an ill office for a gentleman, Especially against his very friend.  DUKE. Where your good word cannot advantage him, Your slander never can endamage him; Therefore the office is indifferent, Being entreated to it by your friend.  PROTEUS. You have prevailed, my lord. If I can do it By aught that I can speak in his dispraise, She shall not long continue love to him. But say this weed her love from Valentine, It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio.  THURIO. Therefore, as you unwind her love from him, Lest it should ravel and be good to none, You must provide to bottom it on me, Which must be done by praising me as much As you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine.  DUKE. And, Proteus, we dare trust you in this kind Because we know, on Valentine’s report, You are already Love’s firm votary And cannot soon revolt and change your mind. Upon this warrant shall you have access Where you with Silvia may confer at large— For she is lumpish, heavy, melancholy, And, for your friend’s sake, will be glad of you— Where you may temper her by your persuasion To hate young Valentine and love my friend.  PROTEUS. As much as I can do I will effect. But you, Sir Thurio, are not sharp enough. You must lay lime to tangle her desires By wailful sonnets, whose composed rhymes Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows.  DUKE. Ay, much is the force of heaven-bred poesy.  PROTEUS. Say that upon the altar of her beauty You sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart. Write till your ink be dry, and with your tears Moist it again, and frame some feeling line That may discover such integrity. For Orpheus’ lute was strung with poets’ sinews, Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones, Make tigers tame, and huge leviathans Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands. After your dire-lamenting elegies, Visit by night your lady’s chamber-window With some sweet consort; to their instruments Tune a deploring dump; the night’s dead silence Will well become such sweet-complaining grievance. This, or else nothing, will inherit her.  DUKE. This discipline shows thou hast been in love.  THURIO. And thy advice this night I’ll put in practice. Therefore, sweet Proteus, my direction-giver, Let us into the city presently To sort some gentlemen well skilled in music. I have a sonnet that will serve the turn To give the onset to thy good advice.  DUKE. About it, gentlemen!  PROTEUS. We’ll wait upon your Grace till after supper, And afterward determine our proceedings.  DUKE. Even now about it! I will pardon you.  [_Exeunt._]
  ACT IV  SCENE I. A forest between Milan and Verona
Enter certain Outlaws.  FIRST OUTLAW. Fellows, stand fast. I see a passenger.  SECOND OUTLAW. If there be ten, shrink not, but down with ’em.  Enter Valentine and Speed.  THIRD OUTLAW. Stand, sir, and throw us that you have about ye. If not, we’ll make you sit, and rifle you.  SPEED. Sir, we are undone: these are the villains That all the travellers do fear so much.  VALENTINE. My friends—  FIRST OUTLAW. That’s not so, sir. We are your enemies.  SECOND OUTLAW. Peace! We’ll hear him.  THIRD OUTLAW. Ay, by my beard, will we, for he is a proper man.  VALENTINE. Then know that I have little wealth to lose. A man I am crossed with adversity; My riches are these poor habiliments, Of which if you should here disfurnish me, You take the sum and substance that I have.  SECOND OUTLAW. Whither travel you?  VALENTINE. To Verona.  FIRST OUTLAW. Whence came you?  VALENTINE. From Milan.  THIRD OUTLAW. Have you long sojourned there?  VALENTINE. Some sixteen months, and longer might have stayed If crooked fortune had not thwarted me.  FIRST OUTLAW. What, were you banished thence?  VALENTINE. I was.  SECOND OUTLAW. For what offence?  VALENTINE. For that which now torments me to rehearse; I killed a man, whose death I much repent, But yet I slew him manfully in fight, Without false vantage or base treachery.  FIRST OUTLAW. Why, ne’er repent it, if it were done so. But were you banished for so small a fault?  VALENTINE. I was, and held me glad of such a doom.  SECOND OUTLAW. Have you the tongues?  VALENTINE. My youthful travel therein made me happy, Or else I often had been miserable.  THIRD OUTLAW. By the bare scalp of Robin Hood’s fat friar, This fellow were a king for our wild faction.  FIRST OUTLAW. We’ll have him. Sirs, a word.  SPEED. Master, be one of them. It’s an honourable kind of thievery.  VALENTINE. Peace, villain.  SECOND OUTLAW. Tell us this: have you anything to take to?  VALENTINE. Nothing but my fortune.  THIRD OUTLAW. Know then that some of us are gentlemen, Such as the fury of ungoverned youth Thrust from the company of awful men. Myself was from Verona banished For practising to steal away a lady, An heir, and near allied unto the Duke.  SECOND OUTLAW. And I from Mantua, for a gentleman Who, in my mood, I stabbed unto the heart.  FIRST OUTLAW. And I for suchlike petty crimes as these. But to the purpose, for we cite our faults, That they may hold excused our lawless lives; And partly, seeing you are beautified With goodly shape, and by your own report A linguist, and a man of such perfection As we do in our quality much want—  SECOND OUTLAW. Indeed because you are a banished man, Therefore, above the rest, we parley to you. Are you content to be our general? To make a virtue of necessity And live as we do in this wilderness?  THIRD OUTLAW. What sayst thou? Wilt thou be of our consort? Say “Ay”, and be the captain of us all, We’ll do thee homage and be ruled by thee, Love thee as our commander and our king.  FIRST OUTLAW. But if thou scorn our courtesy, thou diest.  SECOND OUTLAW. Thou shalt not live to brag what we have offered.  VALENTINE. I take your offer and will live with you, Provided that you do no outrages On silly women or poor passengers.  THIRD OUTLAW. No, we detest such vile base practices. Come, go with us; we’ll bring thee to our crews And show thee all the treasure we have got, Which, with ourselves, all rest at thy dispose.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. Milan. The court of the Duke’s palace  Enter Proteus.  PROTEUS. Already have I been false to Valentine, And now I must be as unjust to Thurio. Under the colour of commending him, I have access my own love to prefer. But Silvia is too fair, too true, too holy To be corrupted with my worthless gifts. When I protest true loyalty to her, She twits me with my falsehood to my friend; When to her beauty I commend my vows, She bids me think how I have been forsworn In breaking faith with Julia, whom I loved; And notwithstanding all her sudden quips, The least whereof would quell a lover’s hope, Yet, spaniel-like, the more she spurns my love, The more it grows and fawneth on her still. But here comes Thurio. Now must we to her window, And give some evening music to her ear.  Enter Thurio and Musicians.  THURIO. How now, Sir Proteus, are you crept before us?  PROTEUS. Ay, gentle Thurio, for you know that love Will creep in service where it cannot go.  THURIO. Ay, but I hope, sir, that you love not here.  PROTEUS. Sir, but I do, or else I would be hence.  THURIO. Who? Silvia?  PROTEUS. Ay, Silvia, for your sake.  THURIO. I thank you for your own. Now, gentlemen, Let’s tune, and to it lustily awhile.  Enter Host and Julia in boy’s clothes, as Sebastian.  HOST. Now, my young guest, methinks you’re allycholly. I pray you, why is it?  JULIA. Marry, mine host, because I cannot be merry.  HOST. Come, we’ll have you merry. I’ll bring you where you shall hear music, and see the gentleman that you asked for.  JULIA. But shall I hear him speak?  HOST. Ay, that you shall.  JULIA. That will be music.  [_Music plays._]  HOST. Hark, hark!  JULIA. Is he among these?  HOST. Ay; but peace, let’s hear ’em.  SONG  PROTEUS.     Who is Silvia? What is she,       That all our swains commend her?     Holy, fair, and wise is she;       The heaven such grace did lend her,     That she might admired be.      Is she kind as she is fair?       For beauty lives with kindness.     Love doth to her eyes repair,       To help him of his blindness;     And, being helped, inhabits there.      Then to Silvia let us sing,       That Silvia is excelling;     She excels each mortal thing       Upon the dull earth dwelling.     To her let us garlands bring.  HOST. How now, are you sadder than you were before? How do you, man? The music likes you not.  JULIA. You mistake; the musician likes me not.  HOST. Why, my pretty youth?  JULIA. He plays false, father.  HOST. How, out of tune on the strings?  JULIA. Not so; but yet so false that he grieves my very heart-strings.  HOST. You have a quick ear.  JULIA. Ay, I would I were deaf; it makes me have a slow heart.  HOST. I perceive you delight not in music.  JULIA. Not a whit, when it jars so.  HOST. Hark, what fine change is in the music!  JULIA. Ay, that change is the spite.  HOST. You would have them always play but one thing?  JULIA. I would always have one play but one thing. But, host, doth this Sir Proteus, that we talk on, Often resort unto this gentlewoman?  HOST. I tell you what Lance, his man, told me: he loved her out of all nick.  JULIA. Where is Lance?  HOST. Gone to seek his dog, which tomorrow, by his master’s command, he must carry for a present to his lady.  JULIA. Peace, stand aside. The company parts.  PROTEUS. Sir Thurio, fear not you; I will so plead That you shall say my cunning drift excels.  THURIO. Where meet we?  PROTEUS. At Saint Gregory’s well.  THURIO. Farewell.  [_Exeunt Thurio and Musicians._]  Enter Silvia above.  PROTEUS. Madam, good even to your ladyship.  SILVIA. I thank you for your music, gentlemen. Who is that that spake?  PROTEUS. One, lady, if you knew his pure heart’s truth, You would quickly learn to know him by his voice.  SILVIA. Sir Proteus, as I take it.  PROTEUS. Sir Proteus, gentle lady, and your servant.  SILVIA. What’s your will?  PROTEUS. That I may compass yours.  SILVIA. You have your wish. My will is even this, That presently you hie you home to bed. Thou subtle, perjured, false, disloyal man, Think’st thou I am so shallow, so conceitless, To be seduced by thy flattery, That hast deceived so many with thy vows? Return, return, and make thy love amends. For me, by this pale queen of night I swear, I am so far from granting thy request That I despise thee for thy wrongful suit, And by and by intend to chide myself Even for this time I spend in talking to thee.  PROTEUS. I grant, sweet love, that I did love a lady, But she is dead.  JULIA. [_Aside_.] ’Twere false, if I should speak it, For I am sure she is not buried.  SILVIA. Say that she be; yet Valentine thy friend Survives, to whom, thyself art witness, I am betrothed. And art thou not ashamed To wrong him with thy importunacy?  PROTEUS. I likewise hear that Valentine is dead.  SILVIA. And so suppose am I, for in his grave, Assure thyself, my love is buried.  PROTEUS. Sweet lady, let me rake it from the earth.  SILVIA. Go to thy lady’s grave and call hers thence, Or, at the least, in hers sepulchre thine.  JULIA. [_Aside_.] He heard not that.  PROTEUS. Madam, if your heart be so obdurate, Vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love, The picture that is hanging in your chamber; To that I’ll speak, to that I’ll sigh and weep; For since the substance of your perfect self Is else devoted, I am but a shadow; And to your shadow will I make true love.  JULIA. [_Aside_.] If ’twere a substance you would sure deceive it And make it but a shadow, as I am.  SILVIA. I am very loath to be your idol, sir; But since your falsehood shall become you well To worship shadows and adore false shapes, Send to me in the morning, and I’ll send it. And so, good rest.  [_Exit._]  PROTEUS. As wretches have o’ernight That wait for execution in the morn.  [_Exit._]  JULIA. Host, will you go?  HOST. By my halidom, I was fast asleep.  JULIA. Pray you, where lies Sir Proteus?  HOST. Marry, at my house. Trust me, I think ’tis almost day.  JULIA. Not so; but it hath been the longest night That e’er I watched, and the most heaviest.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. The same  Enter Eglamour.  EGLAMOUR. This is the hour that Madam Silvia Entreated me to call and know her mind; There’s some great matter she’d employ me in. Madam, madam!  Enter Silvia above.  SILVIA. Who calls?  EGLAMOUR. Your servant and your friend; One that attends your ladyship’s command.  SILVIA. Sir Eglamour, a thousand times good morrow.  EGLAMOUR. As many, worthy lady, to yourself. According to your ladyship’s impose, I am thus early come to know what service It is your pleasure to command me in.  SILVIA. O Eglamour, thou art a gentleman— Think not I flatter, for I swear I do not— Valiant, wise, remorseful, well accomplished. Thou art not ignorant what dear good will I bear unto the banished Valentine, Nor how my father would enforce me marry Vain Thurio, whom my very soul abhorred. Thyself hast loved, and I have heard thee say No grief did ever come so near thy heart As when thy lady and thy true love died, Upon whose grave thou vowed’st pure chastity. Sir Eglamour, I would to Valentine, To Mantua, where I hear he makes abode; And for the ways are dangerous to pass, I do desire thy worthy company, Upon whose faith and honour I repose. Urge not my father’s anger, Eglamour, But think upon my grief, a lady’s grief, And on the justice of my flying hence To keep me from a most unholy match, Which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues. I do desire thee, even from a heart As full of sorrows as the sea of sands, To bear me company and go with me; If not, to hide what I have said to thee, That I may venture to depart alone.  EGLAMOUR. Madam, I pity much your grievances, Which, since I know they virtuously are placed, I give consent to go along with you, Recking as little what betideth me As much I wish all good befortune you. When will you go?  SILVIA. This evening coming.  EGLAMOUR. Where shall I meet you?  SILVIA. At Friar Patrick’s cell, Where I intend holy confession.  EGLAMOUR. I will not fail your ladyship. Good morrow, gentle lady.  SILVIA. Good morrow, kind Sir Eglamour.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IV. The same  Enter Lance with his dog Crab.  LANCE. When a man’s servant shall play the cur with him, look you, it goes hard: one that I brought up of a puppy; one that I saved from drowning when three or four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it. I have taught him even as one would say precisely, “Thus I would teach a dog.” I was sent to deliver him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master; and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but he steps me to her trencher and steals her capon’s leg. O, ’tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself in all companies! I would have, as one should say, one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be, as it were, a dog at all things. If I had not had more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did, I think verily he had been hanged for’t; sure as I live, he had suffered for’t. You shall judge. He thrusts me himself into the company of three or four gentleman-like dogs under the Duke’s table; he had not been there—bless the mark!—a pissing-while but all the chamber smelt him. “Out with the dog!” says one; “What cur is that?” says another; “Whip him out”, says the third; “Hang him up”, says the Duke. I, having been acquainted with the smell before, knew it was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that whips the dogs. “Friend,” quoth I, “you mean to whip the dog?” “Ay, marry do I,” quoth he. “You do him the more wrong,” quoth I. “’Twas I did the thing you wot of.” He makes me no more ado but whips me out of the chamber. How many masters would do this for his servant? Nay, I’ll be sworn I have sat in the stock for puddings he hath stolen, otherwise he had been executed. I have stood on the pillory for geese he hath killed, otherwise he had suffered for’t. [_To Crab_.] Thou think’st not of this now. Nay, I remember the trick you served me when I took my leave of Madam Silvia. Did not I bid thee still mark me, and do as I do? When didst thou see me heave up my leg and make water against a gentlewoman’s farthingale? Didst thou ever see me do such a trick?  Enter Proteus and Julia disguised as Sebastian.  PROTEUS. Sebastian is thy name? I like thee well, And will employ thee in some service presently.  JULIA. In what you please; I’ll do what I can.  PROTEUS. I hope thou wilt. [_To Lance_.] How now, you whoreson peasant, Where have you been these two days loitering?  LANCE. Marry, sir, I carried Mistress Silvia the dog you bade me.  PROTEUS. And what says she to my little jewel?  LANCE. Marry, she says your dog was a cur, and tells you currish thanks is good enough for such a present.  PROTEUS. But she received my dog?  LANCE. No, indeed, did she not. Here have I brought him back again.  PROTEUS. What, didst thou offer her this from me?  LANCE. Ay, sir, the other squirrel was stolen from me by the hangman’s boys in the market-place, and then I offered her mine own, who is a dog as big as ten of yours, and therefore the gift the greater.  PROTEUS. Go, get thee hence, and find my dog again, Or ne’er return again into my sight. Away, I say. Stayest thou to vex me here? A slave that still an end turns me to shame.  [_Exit Lance with Crab._]  Sebastian, I have entertained thee Partly that I have need of such a youth That can with some discretion do my business— For ’tis no trusting to yond foolish lout— But chiefly for thy face and thy behaviour, Which, if my augury deceive me not, Witness good bringing up, fortune, and truth. Therefore, know thou, for this I entertain thee. Go presently, and take this ring with thee, Deliver it to Madam Silvia. She loved me well delivered it to me.  JULIA. It seems you loved not her, to leave her token. She’s dead belike?  PROTEUS. Not so; I think she lives.  JULIA. Alas!  PROTEUS. Why dost thou cry “Alas”?  JULIA. I cannot choose But pity her.  PROTEUS. Wherefore shouldst thou pity her?  JULIA. Because methinks that she loved you as well As you do love your lady Silvia. She dreams on him that has forgot her love; You dote on her that cares not for your love. ’Tis pity love should be so contrary; And thinking on it makes me cry “Alas.”  PROTEUS. Well, give her that ring, and therewithal This letter. That’s her chamber. Tell my lady I claim the promise for her heavenly picture. Your message done, hie home unto my chamber, Where thou shalt find me sad and solitary.  [_Exit._]  JULIA. How many women would do such a message? Alas, poor Proteus, thou hast entertained A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs. Alas, poor fool, why do I pity him That with his very heart despiseth me? Because he loves her, he despiseth me; Because I love him, I must pity him. This ring I gave him when he parted from me, To bind him to remember my good will; And now am I, unhappy messenger, To plead for that which I would not obtain, To carry that which I would have refused, To praise his faith, which I would have dispraised. I am my master’s true confirmed love, But cannot be true servant to my master Unless I prove false traitor to myself. Yet will I woo for him, but yet so coldly As, heaven it knows, I would not have him speed.  Enter Silvia attended.  Gentlewoman, good day. I pray you be my mean To bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia.  SILVIA. What would you with her, if that I be she?  JULIA. If you be she, I do entreat your patience To hear me speak the message I am sent on.  SILVIA. From whom?  JULIA. From my master, Sir Proteus, madam.  SILVIA. O, he sends you for a picture?  JULIA. Ay, madam.  SILVIA. Ursula, bring my picture there.  [_She is brought the picture._]  Go, give your master this. Tell him from me, One Julia, that his changing thoughts forget, Would better fit his chamber than this shadow.  JULIA. Madam, please you peruse this letter.  [_Gives her a letter._]  Pardon me, madam, I have unadvised Delivered you a paper that I should not. This is the letter to your ladyship.  [_Takes back the letter and gives her another._]  SILVIA. I pray thee, let me look on that again.  JULIA. It may not be. Good madam, pardon me.  SILVIA. There, hold. I will not look upon your master’s lines. I know they are stuffed with protestations And full of new-found oaths, which he will break As easily as I do tear his paper.  [_She tears the second letter._]  JULIA. Madam, he sends your ladyship this ring.  SILVIA. The more shame for him that he sends it me; For I have heard him say a thousand times His Julia gave it him at his departure. Though his false finger have profaned the ring, Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.  JULIA. She thanks you.  SILVIA. What sayst thou?  JULIA. I thank you, madam, that you tender her. Poor gentlewoman, my master wrongs her much.  SILVIA. Dost thou know her?  JULIA. Almost as well as I do know myself. To think upon her woes, I do protest That I have wept a hundred several times.  SILVIA. Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her?  JULIA. I think she doth, and that’s her cause of sorrow.  SILVIA. Is she not passing fair?  JULIA. She hath been fairer, madam, than she is. When she did think my master loved her well, She, in my judgement, was as fair as you. But since she did neglect her looking-glass And threw her sun-expelling mask away, The air hath starved the roses in her cheeks And pinched the lily-tincture of her face, That now she is become as black as I.  SILVIA. How tall was she?  JULIA. About my stature; for at Pentecost, When all our pageants of delight were played, Our youth got me to play the woman’s part, And I was trimmed in Madam Julia’s gown, Which served me as fit, by all men’s judgements, As if the garment had been made for me; Therefore I know she is about my height. And at that time I made her weep agood, For I did play a lamentable part. Madam, ’twas Ariadne, passioning For Theseus’ perjury and unjust flight, Which I so lively acted with my tears That my poor mistress, moved therewithal, Wept bitterly; and would I might be dead If I in thought felt not her very sorrow.  SILVIA. She is beholding to thee, gentle youth. Alas, poor lady, desolate and left! I weep myself to think upon thy words. Here, youth, there is my purse. I give thee this For thy sweet mistress’ sake, because thou lov’st her. Farewell.  JULIA. And she shall thank you for’t, if e’er you know her.  [_Exeunt Silvia and Attendants._]  A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful. I hope my master’s suit will be but cold, Since she respects my mistress’ love so much. Alas, how love can trifle with itself! Here is her picture; let me see. I think If I had such a tire, this face of mine Were full as lovely as is this of hers; And yet the painter flattered her a little, Unless I flatter with myself too much. Her hair is auburn, mine is perfect yellow; If that be all the difference in his love, I’ll get me such a coloured periwig. Her eyes are grey as glass, and so are mine. Ay, but her forehead’s low, and mine’s as high. What should it be that he respects in her But I can make respective in myself, If this fond Love were not a blinded god? Come, shadow, come, and take this shadow up, For ’tis thy rival. O thou senseless form, Thou shalt be worshipped, kissed, loved, and adored; And were there sense in his idolatry, My substance should be statue in thy stead. I’ll use thee kindly for thy mistress’ sake, That used me so; or else, by Jove I vow, I should have scratched out your unseeing eyes To make my master out of love with thee.  [_Exit._]

  PROLOGUE
Flourish. Enter Prologue.  PROLOGUE. New plays and maidenheads are near akin: Much followed both, for both much money gi’en, If they stand sound and well. And a good play, Whose modest scenes blush on his marriage day And shake to lose his honour, is like her That after holy tie and first night’s stir Yet still is Modesty, and still retains More of the maid, to sight, than husband’s pains. We pray our play may be so, for I am sure It has a noble breeder and a pure, A learned, and a poet never went More famous yet ’twixt Po and silver Trent. Chaucer, of all admired, the story gives; There, constant to eternity, it lives. If we let fall the nobleness of this, And the first sound this child hear be a hiss, How will it shake the bones of that good man And make him cry from underground, “O, fan From me the witless chaff of such a writer That blasts my bays and my famed works makes lighter Than Robin Hood!” This is the fear we bring; For, to say truth, it were an endless thing And too ambitious, to aspire to him, Weak as we are, and, almost breathless, swim In this deep water. Do but you hold out Your helping hands, and we shall tack about And something do to save us. You shall hear Scenes, though below his art, may yet appear Worth two hours’ travel. To his bones sweet sleep; Content to you. If this play do not keep A little dull time from us, we perceive Our losses fall so thick, we must needs leave.  [_Flourish. Exit._]

Enter Jailer and Wooer.  JAILER. I may depart with little while I live; something I may cast to you, not much. Alas, the prison I keep, though it be for great ones, yet they seldom come; before one salmon, you shall take a number of minnows. I am given out to be better lined than it can appear to me report is a true speaker. I would I were really that I am delivered to be. Marry, what I have, be it what it will, I will assure upon my daughter at the day of my death.  WOOER. Sir, I demand no more than your own offer, and I will estate your daughter in what I have promised.  JAILER. Well, we will talk more of this when the solemnity is past. But have you a full promise of her? When that shall be seen, I tender my consent.  Enter the Jailer’s Daughter, carrying rushes.  WOOER. I have sir. Here she comes.  JAILER. Your friend and I have chanced to name you here, upon the old business. But no more of that now; so soon as the court hurry is over, we will have an end of it. I’ th’ meantime, look tenderly to the two prisoners. I can tell you they are princes.  DAUGHTER. These strewings are for their chamber. ’Tis pity they are in prison, and ’twere pity they should be out. I do think they have patience to make any adversity ashamed. The prison itself is proud of ’em, and they have all the world in their chamber.  JAILER. They are famed to be a pair of absolute men.  DAUGHTER. By my troth, I think fame but stammers ’em; they stand a grise above the reach of report.  JAILER. I heard them reported in the battle to be the only doers.  DAUGHTER. Nay, most likely, for they are noble sufferers. I marvel how they would have looked had they been victors, that with such a constant nobility enforce a freedom out of bondage, making misery their mirth and affliction a toy to jest at.  JAILER. Do they so?  DAUGHTER. It seems to me they have no more sense of their captivity than I of ruling Athens. They eat well, look merrily, discourse of many things, but nothing of their own restraint and disasters. Yet sometime a divided sigh, martyred as ’twere i’ th’ deliverance, will break from one of them—when the other presently gives it so sweet a rebuke that I could wish myself a sigh to be so chid, or at least a sigher to be comforted.  WOOER. I never saw ’em.  JAILER. The Duke himself came privately in the night, and so did they.  Enter Palamon and Arcite, above.  What the reason of it is, I know not. Look, yonder they are; that’s Arcite looks out.  DAUGHTER. No, sir, no, that’s Palamon. Arcite is the lower of the twain; you may perceive a part of him.  JAILER. Go to, leave your pointing; they would not make us their object. Out of their sight.  DAUGHTER. It is a holiday to look on them. Lord, the difference of men!  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. The prison  Enter Palamon and Arcite in prison.  PALAMON. How do you, noble cousin?  ARCITE. How do you, sir?  PALAMON. Why, strong enough to laugh at misery And bear the chance of war; yet we are prisoners I fear for ever, cousin.  ARCITE. I believe it, And to that destiny have patiently Laid up my hour to come.  PALAMON. O, cousin Arcite, Where is Thebes now? Where is our noble country? Where are our friends and kindreds? Never more Must we behold those comforts, never see The hardy youths strive for the games of honour, Hung with the painted favours of their ladies, Like tall ships under sail; then start amongst ’em, And as an east wind leave ’em all behind us, Like lazy clouds, whilst Palamon and Arcite, Even in the wagging of a wanton leg, Outstripped the people’s praises, won the garlands, Ere they have time to wish ’em ours. O, never Shall we two exercise, like twins of honour, Our arms again, and feel our fiery horses Like proud seas under us! Our good swords now— Better the red-eyed god of war ne’er wore— Ravished our sides, like age must run to rust And deck the temples of those gods that hate us; These hands shall never draw ’em out like lightning To blast whole armies more.  ARCITE. No, Palamon, Those hopes are prisoners with us. Here we are, And here the graces of our youths must wither Like a too-timely spring; here age must find us And, which is heaviest, Palamon, unmarried. The sweet embraces of a loving wife, Loaden with kisses, armed with thousand Cupids, Shall never clasp our necks; no issue know us, No figures of ourselves shall we e’er see, To glad our age, and like young eagles teach ’em Boldly to gaze against bright arms and say “Remember what your fathers were, and conquer!” The fair-eyed maids shall weep our banishments And in their songs curse ever-blinded Fortune Till she for shame see what a wrong she has done To youth and nature. This is all our world. We shall know nothing here but one another, Hear nothing but the clock that tells our woes. The vine shall grow, but we shall never see it; Summer shall come, and with her all delights, But dead-cold winter must inhabit here still.  PALAMON. ’Tis too true, Arcite. To our Theban hounds That shook the aged forest with their echoes No more now must we hallow, no more shake Our pointed javelins whilst the angry swine Flies like a Parthian quiver from our rages, Struck with our well-steeled darts. All valiant uses, The food and nourishment of noble minds, In us two here shall perish; we shall die, Which is the curse of honour, lastly, Children of grief and ignorance.  ARCITE. Yet, cousin, Even from the bottom of these miseries, From all that fortune can inflict upon us, I see two comforts rising, two mere blessings, If the gods please: to hold here a brave patience, And the enjoying of our griefs together. Whilst Palamon is with me, let me perish If I think this our prison!  PALAMON. Certainly ’Tis a main goodness, cousin, that our fortunes Were twined together; ’tis most true, two souls Put in two noble bodies, let ’em suffer The gall of hazard, so they grow together, Will never sink; they must not, say they could. A willing man dies sleeping and all’s done.  ARCITE. Shall we make worthy uses of this place That all men hate so much?  PALAMON. How, gentle cousin?  ARCITE. Let’s think this prison holy sanctuary, To keep us from corruption of worse men. We are young and yet desire the ways of honour; That liberty and common conversation, The poison of pure spirits, might like women, Woo us to wander from. What worthy blessing Can be but our imaginations May make it ours? And here being thus together, We are an endless mine to one another; We are one another’s wife, ever begetting New births of love; we are father, friends, acquaintance; We are, in one another, families; I am your heir, and you are mine. This place Is our inheritance; no hard oppressor Dare take this from us; here with a little patience We shall live long and loving. No surfeits seek us; The hand of war hurts none here, nor the seas Swallow their youth. Were we at liberty, A wife might part us lawfully, or business; Quarrels consume us; envy of ill men Crave our acquaintance. I might sicken, cousin, Where you should never know it, and so perish Without your noble hand to close mine eyes, Or prayers to the gods. A thousand chances, Were we from hence, would sever us.  PALAMON. You have made me— I thank you, cousin Arcite—almost wanton With my captivity. What a misery It is to live abroad and everywhere! ’Tis like a beast, methinks. I find the court here, I am sure, a more content; and all those pleasures That woo the wills of men to vanity I see through now, and am sufficient To tell the world ’tis but a gaudy shadow That old Time as he passes by takes with him. What had we been, old in the court of Creon, Where sin is justice, lust and ignorance The virtues of the great ones? Cousin Arcite, Had not the loving gods found this place for us, We had died as they do, ill old men, unwept, And had their epitaphs, the people’s curses. Shall I say more?  ARCITE. I would hear you still.  PALAMON. Ye shall. Is there record of any two that loved Better than we do, Arcite?  ARCITE. Sure, there cannot.  PALAMON. I do not think it possible our friendship Should ever leave us.  ARCITE. Till our deaths it cannot;  Enter Emilia and her Woman, below.  And after death our spirits shall be led To those that love eternally. Speak on, sir.  EMILIA. This garden has a world of pleasures in’t. What flower is this?  WOMAN. ’Tis called narcissus, madam.  EMILIA. That was a fair boy, certain, but a fool, To love himself. Were there not maids enough?  ARCITE. Pray, forward.  PALAMON. Yes.  EMILIA. Or were they all hard-hearted?  WOMAN. They could not be to one so fair.  EMILIA. Thou wouldst not.  WOMAN. I think I should not, madam.  EMILIA. That’s a good wench. But take heed to your kindness, though.  WOMAN. Why, madam?  EMILIA. Men are mad things.  ARCITE. Will ye go forward, cousin?  EMILIA. Canst not thou work such flowers in silk, wench?  WOMAN. Yes.  EMILIA. I’ll have a gown full of ’em, and of these. This is a pretty colour; will ’t not do Rarely upon a skirt, wench?  WOMAN. Dainty, madam.  ARCITE. Cousin, cousin! How do you, sir? Why, Palamon!  PALAMON. Never till now I was in prison, Arcite.  ARCITE. Why, what’s the matter, man?  PALAMON. Behold, and wonder! By heaven, she is a goddess.  ARCITE. Ha!  PALAMON. Do reverence. She is a goddess, Arcite.  EMILIA. Of all flowers, Methinks a rose is best.  WOMAN. Why, gentle madam?  EMILIA. It is the very emblem of a maid. For when the west wind courts her gently, How modestly she blows and paints the sun With her chaste blushes! When the north comes near her, Rude and impatient, then, like chastity, She locks her beauties in her bud again, And leaves him to base briers.  WOMAN. Yet, good madam, Sometimes her modesty will blow so far She falls for ’t. A maid, If she have any honour, would be loath To take example by her.  EMILIA. Thou art wanton.  ARCITE. She is wondrous fair.  PALAMON. She is all the beauty extant.  EMILIA. The sun grows high; let’s walk in. Keep these flowers. We’ll see how near art can come near their colours. I am wondrous merry-hearted. I could laugh now.  WOMAN. I could lie down, I am sure.  EMILIA. And take one with you?  WOMAN. That’s as we bargain, madam.  EMILIA. Well, agree then.  [_Exeunt Emilia and Woman._]  PALAMON. What think you of this beauty?  ARCITE. ’Tis a rare one.  PALAMON. Is’t but a rare one?  ARCITE. Yes, a matchless beauty.  PALAMON. Might not a man well lose himself, and love her?  ARCITE. I cannot tell what you have done; I have, Beshrew mine eyes for’t! Now I feel my shackles.  PALAMON. You love her, then?  ARCITE. Who would not?  PALAMON. And desire her?  ARCITE. Before my liberty.  PALAMON. I saw her first.  ARCITE. That’s nothing.  PALAMON. But it shall be.  ARCITE. I saw her too.  PALAMON. Yes, but you must not love her.  ARCITE. I will not, as you do, to worship her As she is heavenly and a blessed goddess. I love her as a woman, to enjoy her. So both may love.  PALAMON. You shall not love at all.  ARCITE. Not love at all! Who shall deny me?  PALAMON. I, that first saw her; I that took possession First with mine eye of all those beauties in her Revealed to mankind. If thou lovest her, Or entertain’st a hope to blast my wishes, Thou art a traitor, Arcite, and a fellow False as thy title to her. Friendship, blood, And all the ties between us, I disclaim If thou once think upon her.  ARCITE. Yes, I love her; And, if the lives of all my name lay on it, I must do so; I love her with my soul. If that will lose ye, farewell, Palamon. I say again, I love, and in loving her maintain I am as worthy and as free a lover And have as just a title to her beauty, As any Palamon, or any living That is a man’s son.  PALAMON. Have I called thee friend?  ARCITE. Yes, and have found me so. Why are you moved thus? Let me deal coldly with you: am not I Part of your blood, part of your soul? You have told me That I was Palamon and you were Arcite.  PALAMON. Yes.  ARCITE. Am not I liable to those affections, Those joys, griefs, angers, fears, my friend shall suffer?  PALAMON. Ye may be.  ARCITE. Why then would you deal so cunningly, So strangely, so unlike a noble kinsman, To love alone? Speak truly; do you think me Unworthy of her sight?  PALAMON. No; but unjust, If thou pursue that sight.  ARCITE. Because another First sees the enemy, shall I stand still And let mine honour down, and never charge?  PALAMON. Yes, if he be but one.  ARCITE. But say that one Had rather combat me?  PALAMON. Let that one say so, And use thy freedom. Else, if thou pursuest her, Be as that cursed man that hates his country, A branded villain.  ARCITE. You are mad.  PALAMON. I must be, Till thou art worthy, Arcite; it concerns me; And in this madness, if I hazard thee And take thy life, I deal but truely.  ARCITE. Fie, sir! You play the child extremely. I will love her; I must, I ought to do so, and I dare, And all this justly.  PALAMON. O, that now, that now, Thy false self and thy friend had but this fortune, To be one hour at liberty, and grasp Our good swords in our hands! I would quickly teach thee What ’twere to filch affection from another! Thou art baser in it than a cutpurse. Put but thy head out of this window more And, as I have a soul, I’ll nail thy life to ’t.  ARCITE. Thou dar’st not, fool, thou canst not, thou art feeble. Put my head out? I’ll throw my body out And leap the garden, when I see her next And pitch between her arms, to anger thee.  Enter Jailer.  PALAMON. No more; the keeper’s coming. I shall live To knock thy brains out with my shackles.  ARCITE. Do!  JAILER. By your leave, gentlemen.  PALAMON. Now, honest keeper?  JAILER. Lord Arcite, you must presently to th’ Duke; The cause I know not yet.  ARCITE. I am ready, keeper.  JAILER. Prince Palamon, I must awhile bereave you Of your fair cousin’s company.  [_Exeunt Arcite and Jailer._]  PALAMON. And me too, Even when you please, of life.—Why is he sent for? It may be he shall marry her; he’s goodly, And like enough the Duke hath taken notice Both of his blood and body. But his falsehood! Why should a friend be treacherous? If that Get him a wife so noble and so fair, Let honest men ne’er love again. Once more I would but see this fair one. Blessed garden And fruit and flowers more blessed that still blossom As her bright eyes shine on ye! Would I were, For all the fortune of my life hereafter, Yon little tree, yon blooming apricock! How I would spread and fling my wanton arms In at her window! I would bring her fruit Fit for the gods to feed on; youth and pleasure Still as she tasted should be doubled on her; And, if she be not heavenly, I would make her So near the gods in nature, they should fear her.  Enter Jailer.  And then I am sure she would love me. How now, keeper? Where’s Arcite?  JAILER. Banished. Prince Pirithous Obtained his liberty, but never more Upon his oath and life must he set foot Upon this kingdom.  PALAMON. He’s a blessed man. He shall see Thebes again, and call to arms The bold young men that, when he bids ’em charge, Fall on like fire. Arcite shall have a fortune, If he dare make himself a worthy lover, Yet in the field to strike a battle for her; And, if he lose her then, he’s a cold coward. How bravely may he bear himself to win her If he be noble Arcite, thousand ways! Were I at liberty, I would do things Of such a virtuous greatness that this lady, This blushing virgin, should take manhood to her And seek to ravish me.  JAILER. My lord for you I have this charge to—  PALAMON. To discharge my life?  JAILER. No, but from this place to remove your lordship; The windows are too open.  PALAMON. Devils take ’em, That are so envious to me! Prithee, kill me.  JAILER. And hang for’t afterward!  PALAMON. By this good light, Had I a sword I would kill thee.  JAILER. Why, my Lord?  PALAMON. Thou bringst such pelting, scurvy news continually, Thou art not worthy life. I will not go.  JAILER. Indeed, you must, my lord.  PALAMON. May I see the garden?  JAILER. No.  PALAMON. Then I am resolved, I will not go.  JAILER. I must constrain you then; and, for you are dangerous, I’ll clap more irons on you.  PALAMON. Do, good keeper. I’ll shake ’em so, ye shall not sleep; I’ll make you a new morris. Must I go?  JAILER. There is no remedy.  PALAMON. Farewell, kind window. May rude wind never hurt thee!—O, my lady, If ever thou hast felt what sorrow was, Dream how I suffer.—Come, now bury me.  [_Exeunt Palamon and Jailer._]  SCENE III. The country near Athens  Enter Arcite.  ARCITE. Banished the kingdom? ’Tis a benefit, A mercy I must thank ’em for; but banished The free enjoying of that face I die for, O, ’twas a studied punishment, a death Beyond imagination, such a vengeance That, were I old and wicked, all my sins Could never pluck upon me. Palamon, Thou hast the start now; thou shalt stay and see Her bright eyes break each morning ’gainst thy window And let in life into thee; thou shalt feed Upon the sweetness of a noble beauty That nature ne’er exceeded nor ne’er shall. Good gods, what happiness has Palamon! Twenty to one, he’ll come to speak to her; And if she be as gentle as she’s fair, I know she’s his; he has a tongue will tame Tempests and make the wild rocks wanton. Come what can come, The worst is death; I will not leave the kingdom. I know mine own is but a heap of ruins, And no redress there. If I go, he has her. I am resolved another shape shall make me Or end my fortunes. Either way I am happy. I’ll see her and be near her, or no more.  Enter four Countrymen, and one with a garland before them.  FIRST COUNTRYMAN. My masters, I’ll be there, that’s certain.  SECOND COUNTRYMAN. And I’ll be there.  THIRD COUNTRYMAN. And I.  FOURTH COUNTRYMAN. Why, then, have with you, boys. ’Tis but a chiding. Let the plough play today; I’ll tickle ’t out Of the jades’ tails tomorrow.  FIRST COUNTRYMAN. I am sure To have my wife as jealous as a turkey, But that’s all one. I’ll go through; let her mumble.  SECOND COUNTRYMAN. Clap her aboard tomorrow night, and stow her, And all’s made up again.  THIRD COUNTRYMAN. Ay, do but put A fescue in her fist and you shall see her Take a new lesson out and be a good wench. Do we all hold against the Maying?  FOURTH COUNTRYMAN. Hold? What should ail us?  THIRD COUNTRYMAN. Arcas will be there.  SECOND COUNTRYMAN. And Sennois. And Rycas; and three better lads ne’er danced Under green tree. And ye know what wenches, ha? But will the dainty domine, the schoolmaster, Keep touch, do you think? For he does all, ye know.  THIRD COUNTRYMAN. He’ll eat a hornbook ere he fail. Go to; The matter’s too far driven between him And the tanner’s daughter to let slip now; And she must see the Duke, and she must dance too.  FOURTH COUNTRYMAN. Shall we be lusty?  SECOND COUNTRYMAN. All the boys in Athens Blow wind i’ th’ breech on ’s. And here I’ll be, And there I’ll be, for our town, and here again, And there again. Ha, boys, hey for the weavers!  FIRST COUNTRYMAN. This must be done i’ th’ woods.  FOURTH COUNTRYMAN. O, pardon me.  SECOND COUNTRYMAN. By any means; our thing of learning says so— Where he himself will edify the Duke Most parlously in our behalfs. He’s excellent i’ th’ woods; Bring him to th’ plains, his learning makes no cry.  THIRD COUNTRYMAN. We’ll see the sports, then every man to ’s tackle; And, sweet companions, let’s rehearse, by any means, Before the ladies see us, and do sweetly, And God knows what may come on ’t.  FOURTH COUNTRYMAN. Content; the sports once ended, we’ll perform. Away, boys, and hold.  ARCITE. By your leaves, honest friends: pray you, whither go you?  FOURTH COUNTRYMAN. Whither? Why, what a question’s that?  ARCITE. Yes, ’tis a question To me that know not.  THIRD COUNTRYMAN. To the games, my friend.  SECOND COUNTRYMAN. Where were you bred, you know it not?  ARCITE. Not far, sir; Are there such games today?  FIRST COUNTRYMAN. Yes, marry, are there, And such as you never saw; the Duke himself Will be in person there.  ARCITE. What pastimes are they?  SECOND COUNTRYMAN. Wrestling, and running.—’Tis a pretty fellow.  THIRD COUNTRYMAN. Thou wilt not go along?  ARCITE. Not yet, sir.  FOURTH COUNTRYMAN. Well, sir, Take your own time. Come, boys.  FIRST COUNTRYMAN. My mind misgives me, This fellow has a vengeance trick o’ th’ hip; Mark how his body’s made for ’t.  SECOND COUNTRYMAN. I’ll be hanged, though, If he dare venture. Hang him, plum porridge! He wrestle? He roast eggs! Come, let’s be gone, lads.  [_Exeunt Countrymen._]  ARCITE. This is an offered opportunity I durst not wish for. Well I could have wrestled— The best men called it excellent—and run Swifter than wind upon a field of corn, Curling the wealthy ears, never flew. I’ll venture, And in some poor disguise be there. Who knows Whether my brows may not be girt with garlands, And happiness prefer me to a place Where I may ever dwell in sight of her?  [_Exit Arcite._]  SCENE IV. Athens. A room in the prison  Enter Jailer’s Daughter alone.  DAUGHTER. Why should I love this gentleman? ’Tis odds He never will affect me. I am base, My father the mean keeper of his prison, And he a prince. To marry him is hopeless; To be his whore is witless. Out upon ’t! What pushes are we wenches driven to When fifteen once has found us! First, I saw him; I, seeing, thought he was a goodly man; He has as much to please a woman in him, If he please to bestow it so, as ever These eyes yet looked on. Next, I pitied him, And so would any young wench, o’ my conscience, That ever dreamed, or vowed her maidenhead To a young handsome man. Then I loved him, Extremely loved him, infinitely loved him! And yet he had a cousin, fair as he too, But in my heart was Palamon, and there, Lord, what a coil he keeps! To hear him Sing in an evening, what a heaven it is! And yet his songs are sad ones. Fairer spoken Was never gentleman. When I come in To bring him water in a morning, first He bows his noble body, then salutes me thus: “Fair, gentle maid, good morrow. May thy goodness Get thee a happy husband.” Once he kissed me; I loved my lips the better ten days after. Would he would do so ev’ry day! He grieves much— And me as much to see his misery. What should I do to make him know I love him? For I would fain enjoy him. Say I ventured To set him free? What says the law then? Thus much for law or kindred! I will do it; And this night, or tomorrow, he shall love me.  [_Exit._]  SCENE V. An open place in Athens  A short flourish of cornets and shouts within. Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Pirithous, Emilia; Arcite in disguise as a countryman, with a garland, Attendants, and others.  THESEUS. You have done worthily. I have not seen, Since Hercules, a man of tougher sinews. Whate’er you are, you run the best and wrestle, That these times can allow.  ARCITE. I am proud to please you.  THESEUS. What country bred you?  ARCITE. This; but far off, Prince.  THESEUS. Are you a gentleman?  ARCITE. My father said so; And to those gentle uses gave me life.  THESEUS. Are you his heir?  ARCITE. His youngest, sir.  THESEUS. Your father Sure is a happy sire then. What profess you?  ARCITE. A little of all noble qualities. I could have kept a hawk and well have hallowed To a deep cry of dogs. I dare not praise My feat in horsemanship, yet they that knew me Would say it was my best piece; last, and greatest, I would be thought a soldier.  THESEUS. You are perfect.  PIRITHOUS. Upon my soul, a proper man.  EMILIA. He is so.  PIRITHOUS. How do you like him, lady?  HIPPOLYTA. I admire him. I have not seen so young a man so noble, If he say true, of his sort.  EMILIA. Believe, His mother was a wondrous handsome woman; His face, methinks, goes that way.  HIPPOLYTA. But his body And fiery mind illustrate a brave father.  PIRITHOUS. Mark how his virtue, like a hidden sun, Breaks through his baser garments.  HIPPOLYTA. He’s well got, sure.  THESEUS. What made you seek this place, sir?  ARCITE. Noble Theseus, To purchase name and do my ablest service To such a well-found wonder as thy worth; For only in thy court, of all the world, Dwells fair-eyed Honour.  PIRITHOUS. All his words are worthy.  THESEUS. Sir, we are much indebted to your travel, Nor shall you lose your wish.—Pirithous, Dispose of this fair gentleman.  PIRITHOUS. Thanks, Theseus. Whate’er you are, you’re mine, and I shall give you To a most noble service: to this lady, This bright young virgin; pray, observe her goodness. You have honoured her fair birthday with your virtues, And, as your due, you’re hers; kiss her fair hand, sir.  ARCITE. Sir, you’re a noble giver.—Dearest beauty, Thus let me seal my vowed faith.  [_He kisses her hand._]  When your servant, Your most unworthy creature, but offends you, Command him die, he shall.  EMILIA. That were too cruel. If you deserve well, sir, I shall soon see ’t. You’re mine, and somewhat better than your rank I’ll use you.  PIRITHOUS. I’ll see you furnished, and because you say You are a horseman, I must needs entreat you This afternoon to ride, but ’tis a rough one.  ARCITE. I like him better, Prince; I shall not then Freeze in my saddle.  THESEUS. Sweet, you must be ready,— And you, Emilia,—and you, friend,—and all, Tomorrow by the sun, to do observance To flowery May, in Dian’s wood.—Wait well, sir, Upon your mistress.—Emily, I hope He shall not go afoot.  EMILIA. That were a shame, sir, While I have horses.—Take your choice, and what You want at any time, let me but know it. If you serve faithfully, I dare assure you You’ll find a loving mistress.  ARCITE. If I do not, Let me find that my father ever hated, Disgrace and blows.  THESEUS. Go lead the way; you have won it. It shall be so; you shall receive all dues Fit for the honour you have won; ’twere wrong else. Sister, beshrew my heart, you have a servant, That, if I were a woman, would be master. But you are wise.  EMILIA. I hope too wise for that, sir.  [_Flourish. Exeunt._]  SCENE VI. Athens. Before the prison  Enter Jailer’s Daughter alone.  DAUGHTER. Let all the dukes and all the devils roar, He is at liberty! I have ventured for him And out I have brought him; to a little wood A mile hence I have sent him, where a cedar Higher than all the rest spreads like a plane Fast by a brook, and there he shall keep close Till I provide him files and food, for yet His iron bracelets are not off. O Love, What a stout-hearted child thou art! My father Durst better have endured cold iron than done it. I love him beyond love and beyond reason, Or wit, or safety. I have made him know it; I care not, I am desperate. If the law Find me and then condemn me for ’t, some wenches, Some honest-hearted maids, will sing my dirge And tell to memory my death was noble, Dying almost a martyr. That way he takes, I purpose is my way too. Sure he cannot Be so unmanly as to leave me here. If he do, maids will not so easily Trust men again. And yet he has not thanked me For what I have done; no, not so much as kissed me, And that, methinks, is not so well; nor scarcely Could I persuade him to become a free man, He made such scruples of the wrong he did To me and to my father. Yet I hope, When he considers more, this love of mine Will take more root within him. Let him do What he will with me, so he use me kindly; For use me so he shall, or I’ll proclaim him, And to his face, no man. I’ll presently Provide him necessaries and pack my clothes up, And where there is a path of ground I’ll venture, So he be with me. By him, like a shadow I’ll ever dwell. Within this hour the hubbub Will be all o’er the prison. I am then Kissing the man they look for. Farewell, father! Get many more such prisoners and such daughters, And shortly you may keep yourself. Now to him.  [_Exit._]
  ACT III  SCENE I. A forest near Athens
  ACT IV  SCENE I. Athens. A room in the prison
Enter Jailer and his Friend.  JAILER. Hear you no more? Was nothing said of me Concerning the escape of Palamon? Good sir, remember.  FIRST FRIEND. Nothing that I heard, For I came home before the business Was fully ended. Yet I might perceive, Ere I departed, a great likelihood Of both their pardons; for Hippolyta And fair-eyed Emily, upon their knees, Begged with such handsome pity that the Duke Methought stood staggering whether he should follow His rash oath or the sweet compassion Of those two ladies. And, to second them, That truly noble prince, Pirithous, Half his own heart, set in too, that I hope All shall be well. Neither heard I one question Of your name or his ’scape.  JAILER. Pray heaven it hold so.  Enter Second Friend.  SECOND FRIEND. Be of good comfort, man; I bring you news, Good news.  JAILER. They are welcome.  SECOND FRIEND. Palamon has cleared you, And got your pardon, and discovered how And by whose means he escaped, which was your daughter’s, Whose pardon is procured too; and the prisoner, Not to be held ungrateful to her goodness, Has given a sum of money to her marriage, A large one, I’ll assure you.  JAILER. You are a good man And ever bring good news.  FIRST FRIEND. How was it ended?  SECOND FRIEND. Why, as it should be; they that never begged But they prevailed had their suits fairly granted; The prisoners have their lives.  FIRST FRIEND. I knew ’twould be so.  SECOND FRIEND. But there be new conditions, which you’ll hear of At better time.  JAILER. I hope they are good.  SECOND FRIEND. They are honourable; How good they’ll prove, I know not.  FIRST FRIEND. ’Twill be known.  Enter Wooer.  WOOER. Alas, sir, where’s your daughter?  JAILER. Why do you ask?  WOOER. O, sir, when did you see her?  SECOND FRIEND. How he looks?  JAILER. This morning.  WOOER. Was she well? Was she in health, sir? When did she sleep?  FIRST FRIEND. These are strange questions.  JAILER. I do not think she was very well, for now You make me mind her, but this very day I asked her questions, and she answered me So far from what she was, so childishly, So sillily, as if she were a fool, An innocent, and I was very angry. But what of her, sir?  WOOER. Nothing but my pity. But you must know it, and as good by me As by another that less loves her.  JAILER. Well, sir?  FIRST FRIEND. Not right?  SECOND FRIEND. Not well?  WOOER. No, sir, not well: ’Tis too true, she is mad.  FIRST FRIEND. It cannot be.  WOOER. Believe, you’ll find it so.  JAILER. I half suspected What you have told me. The gods comfort her! Either this was her love to Palamon, Or fear of my miscarrying on his ’scape, Or both.  WOOER. ’Tis likely.  JAILER. But why all this haste, sir?  WOOER. I’ll tell you quickly. As I late was angling In the great lake that lies behind the palace, From the far shore, thick set with reeds and sedges, As patiently I was attending sport, I heard a voice, a shrill one; and, attentive, I gave my ear, when I might well perceive ’Twas one that sung, and by the smallness of it A boy or woman. I then left my angle To his own skill, came near, but yet perceived not Who made the sound, the rushes and the reeds Had so encompassed it. I laid me down And listened to the words she sung, for then, Through a small glade cut by the fishermen, I saw it was your daughter.  JAILER. Pray, go on, sir.  WOOER. She sung much, but no sense; only I heard her Repeat this often: “Palamon is gone, Is gone to th’ wood to gather mulberries; I’ll find him out tomorrow.”  FIRST FRIEND. Pretty soul!  WOOER. “His shackles will betray him; he’ll be taken, And what shall I do then? I’ll bring a bevy, A hundred black-eyed maids that love as I do, With chaplets on their heads of daffadillies, With cherry lips and cheeks of damask roses, And all we’ll dance an antic ’fore the Duke, And beg his pardon.” Then she talked of you, sir; That you must lose your head tomorrow morning, And she must gather flowers to bury you, And see the house made handsome. Then she sung Nothing but “Willow, willow, willow,” and between Ever was “Palamon, fair Palamon,” And “Palamon was a tall young man.” The place Was knee-deep where she sat; her careless tresses, A wreath of bulrush rounded; about her stuck Thousand fresh water-flowers of several colours, That methought she appeared like the fair nymph That feeds the lake with waters, or as Iris Newly dropped down from heaven. Rings she made Of rushes that grew by, and to ’em spoke The prettiest posies: “Thus our true love’s tied,” “This you may loose, not me,” and many a one; And then she wept, and sung again, and sighed, And with the same breath smiled and kissed her hand.  SECOND FRIEND. Alas, what pity it is!  WOOER. I made in to her. She saw me, and straight sought the flood. I saved her And set her safe to land, when presently She slipped away, and to the city made With such a cry and swiftness that, believe me, She left me far behind her. Three or four I saw from far off cross her—one of ’em I knew to be your brother—where she stayed And fell, scarce to be got away. I left them with her And hither came to tell you.  Enter Jailer’s Brother, Jailer’s Daughter and others.  Here they are.  DAUGHTER. [_Sings_.]      _May you never more enjoy the light, &c._  Is not this a fine song?  BROTHER. O, a very fine one.  DAUGHTER. I can sing twenty more.  BROTHER. I think you can.  DAUGHTER. Yes, truly can I. I can sing “The Broom” and “Bonny Robin.” Are not you a tailor?  BROTHER. Yes.  DAUGHTER. Where’s my wedding gown?  BROTHER. I’ll bring it tomorrow.  DAUGHTER. Do, very rarely, I must be abroad else To call the maids and pay the minstrels, For I must lose my maidenhead by cocklight. ’Twill never thrive else. [_Sings_.] _O fair, O sweet, &c._  BROTHER. [_To Jailer._] You must e’en take it patiently.  JAILER. ’Tis true.  DAUGHTER. Good ev’n, good men; pray, did you ever hear Of one young Palamon?  JAILER. Yes, wench, we know him.  DAUGHTER. Is’t not a fine young gentleman?  JAILER. ’Tis, love.  BROTHER. By no means cross her; she is then distempered Far worse than now she shows.  FIRST FRIEND. Yes, he’s a fine man.  DAUGHTER. O, is he so? You have a sister?  FIRST FRIEND. Yes.  DAUGHTER. But she shall never have him, tell her so, For a trick that I know; you’d best look to her, For if she see him once, she’s gone, she’s done, And undone in an hour. All the young maids Of our town are in love with him, but I laugh at ’em And let ’em all alone. Is ’t not a wise course?  FIRST FRIEND. Yes.  DAUGHTER. There is at least two hundred now with child by him— There must be four; yet I keep close for all this, Close as a cockle; and all these must be boys He has the trick on ’t; and at ten years old They must be all gelt for musicians And sing the wars of Theseus.  SECOND FRIEND. This is strange.  DAUGHTER. As ever you heard, but say nothing.  FIRST FRIEND. No.  DAUGHTER. They come from all parts of the dukedom to him. I’ll warrant ye, he had not so few last night As twenty to dispatch. He’ll tickle ’t up In two hours, if his hand be in.  JAILER. She’s lost Past all cure.  BROTHER. Heaven forbid, man!  DAUGHTER. Come hither, you are a wise man.  FIRST FRIEND. [_Aside._] Does she know him?  SECOND FRIEND. [_Aside._] No, would she did.  DAUGHTER. You are master of a ship?  JAILER. Yes.  DAUGHTER. Where’s your compass?  JAILER. Here.  DAUGHTER. Set it to th’ north. And now direct your course to th’ wood, where Palamon Lies longing for me. For the tackling, Let me alone. Come, weigh, my hearts, cheerly.  ALL. Owgh, owgh, owgh! ’Tis up, the wind’s fair! Top the bowline; out with the mainsail; Where’s your whistle, master?  BROTHER. Let’s get her in.  JAILER. Up to the top, boy.  BROTHER. Where’s the pilot?  FIRST FRIEND. Here.  DAUGHTER. What kenn’st thou?  SECOND FRIEND. A fair wood.  DAUGHTER. Bear for it, master. Tack about! [_Sings_.]     _When Cinthia with her borrowed light, &c._  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. A Room in the Palace  Enter Emilia alone, with two pictures.  EMILIA. Yet I may bind those wounds up, that must open And bleed to death for my sake else. I’ll choose, And end their strife. Two such young handsome men Shall never fall for me; their weeping mothers, Following the dead cold ashes of their sons, Shall never curse my cruelty.  [_Looks at one of the pictures._]  Good heaven, What a sweet face has Arcite! If wise Nature, With all her best endowments, all those beauties She sows into the births of noble bodies, Were here a mortal woman, and had in her The coy denials of young maids, yet doubtless She would run mad for this man. What an eye, Of what a fiery sparkle and quick sweetness, Has this young prince! Here Love himself sits smiling; Just such another wanton Ganymede Set Jove afire with, and enforced the god Snatch up the goodly boy and set him by him, A shining constellation. What a brow, Of what a spacious majesty, he carries, Arched like the great-eyed Juno’s, but far sweeter, Smoother than Pelops’ shoulder! Fame and Honour, Methinks, from hence, as from a promontory Pointed in heaven, should clap their wings and sing To all the under-world the loves and fights Of gods and such men near ’em.  [_Looks at the other picture._]  Palamon Is but his foil; to him a mere dull shadow; He’s swart and meagre, of an eye as heavy As if he had lost his mother; a still temper, No stirring in him, no alacrity; Of all this sprightly sharpness, not a smile. Yet these that we count errors may become him; Narcissus was a sad boy but a heavenly. O, who can find the bent of woman’s fancy? I am a fool; my reason is lost in me; I have no choice, and I have lied so lewdly That women ought to beat me. On my knees I ask thy pardon, Palamon, thou art alone And only beautiful, and these the eyes, These the bright lamps of beauty, that command And threaten love, and what young maid dare cross ’em? What a bold gravity, and yet inviting, Has this brown manly face! O Love, this only From this hour is complexion. Lie there, Arcite.  [_She puts aside his picture._]  Thou art a changeling to him, a mere gypsy, And this the noble body. I am sotted, Utterly lost. My virgin’s faith has fled me. For if my brother but even now had asked me Whether I loved, I had run mad for Arcite; Now, if my sister, more for Palamon. Stand both together. Now, come ask me, brother. Alas, I know not! Ask me now, sweet sister. I may go look! What a mere child is Fancy, That, having two fair gauds of equal sweetness, Cannot distinguish, but must cry for both.  Enter a Gentleman.  EMILIA. How now, sir?  GENTLEMAN. From the noble Duke your brother, Madam, I bring you news. The knights are come.  EMILIA. To end the quarrel?  GENTLEMAN. Yes.  EMILIA. Would I might end first! What sins have I committed, chaste Diana, That my unspotted youth must now be soiled With blood of princes, and my chastity Be made the altar where the lives of lovers— Two greater and two better never yet Made mothers joy—must be the sacrifice To my unhappy beauty?  Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Pirithous and Attendants.  THESEUS. Bring ’em in Quickly, by any means; I long to see ’em. Your two contending lovers are returned, And with them their fair knights. Now, my fair sister, You must love one of them.  EMILIA. I had rather both, So neither for my sake should fall untimely.  THESEUS. Who saw ’em?  PIRITHOUS. I a while.  GENTLEMAN. And I.  Enter Messenger.  THESEUS. From whence come you, sir?  MESSENGER. From the knights.  THESEUS. Pray, speak, You that have seen them, what they are.  MESSENGER. I will, sir, And truly what I think. Six braver spirits Than these they have brought, if we judge by the outside, I never saw nor read of. He that stands In the first place with Arcite, by his seeming Should be a stout man, by his face a prince, His very looks so say him; his complexion Nearer a brown than black, stern and yet noble, Which shows him hardy, fearless, proud of dangers; The circles of his eyes show fire within him, And as a heated lion so he looks. His hair hangs long behind him, black and shining Like ravens’ wings; his shoulders broad and strong; Armed long and round; and on his thigh a sword Hung by a curious baldric, when he frowns To seal his will with. Better, o’ my conscience, Was never soldier’s friend.  THESEUS. Thou hast well described him.  PIRITHOUS. Yet a great deal short, Methinks, of him that’s first with Palamon.  THESEUS. Pray, speak him, friend.  PIRITHOUS. I guess he is a prince too, And, if it may be, greater; for his show Has all the ornament of honour in ’t: He’s somewhat bigger than the knight he spoke of, But of a face far sweeter; his complexion Is, as a ripe grape, ruddy. He has felt Without doubt what he fights for, and so apter To make this cause his own. In ’s face appears All the fair hopes of what he undertakes And when he’s angry, then a settled valour, Not tainted with extremes, runs through his body And guides his arm to brave things. Fear he cannot; He shows no such soft temper. His head’s yellow, Hard-haired and curled, thick-twined like ivy tods, Not to undo with thunder. In his face The livery of the warlike maid appears, Pure red and white, for yet no beard has blessed him; And in his rolling eyes sits Victory, As if she ever meant to crown his valour. His nose stands high, a character of honour; His red lips, after fights, are fit for ladies.  EMILIA. Must these men die too?  PIRITHOUS. When he speaks, his tongue Sounds like a trumpet. All his lineaments Are as a man would wish ’em, strong and clean. He wears a well-steeled axe, the staff of gold; His age some five-and-twenty.  MESSENGER. There’s another, A little man, but of a tough soul, seeming As great as any; fairer promises In such a body yet I never looked on.  PIRITHOUS. O, he that’s freckle-faced?  MESSENGER. The same, my lord; Are they not sweet ones?  PIRITHOUS. Yes, they are well.  MESSENGER. Methinks, Being so few and well disposed, they show Great and fine art in nature. He’s white-haired, Not wanton white, but such a manly colour Next to an auburn; tough and nimble-set, Which shows an active soul. His arms are brawny, Lined with strong sinews. To the shoulder-piece Gently they swell, like women new-conceived, Which speaks him prone to labour, never fainting Under the weight of arms; stout-hearted still, But when he stirs, a tiger. He’s grey-eyed, Which yields compassion where he conquers; sharp To spy advantages, and where he finds ’em, He’s swift to make ’em his. He does no wrongs, Nor takes none. He’s round-faced, and when he smiles He shows a lover; when he frowns, a soldier. About his head he wears the winner’s oak, And in it stuck the favour of his lady. His age some six-and-thirty. In his hand He bears a charging-staff embossed with silver.  THESEUS. Are they all thus?  PIRITHOUS. They are all the sons of honour.  THESEUS. Now, as I have a soul, I long to see’em. Lady, you shall see men fight now.  HIPPOLYTA. I wish it, But not the cause, my lord. They would show Bravely about the titles of two kingdoms. ’Tis pity love should be so tyrannous.— O, my soft-hearted sister, what think you? Weep not till they weep blood. Wench, it must be.  THESEUS. You have steeled ’em with your beauty. Honoured friend, To you I give the field; pray order it Fitting the persons that must use it.  PIRITHOUS. Yes, sir.  THESEUS. Come, I’ll go visit ’em. I cannot stay, Their fame has fired me so; till they appear. Good friend, be royal.  PIRITHOUS. There shall want no bravery.  [_Exeunt all but Emilia._]  EMILIA. Poor wench, go weep, for whosoever wins, Loses a noble cousin for thy sins.  [_Exit._]  SCENE III. A room in the prison  Enter Jailer, Wooer and Doctor.  DOCTOR. Her distraction is more at some time of the moon, than at other some, is it not?  JAILER. She is continually in a harmless distemper, sleeps little, altogether without appetite, save often drinking, dreaming of another world, and a better; and what broken piece of matter soe’er she’s about, the name Palamon lards it, that she farces every business withal, fits it to every question.  Enter Jailer’s Daughter.  Look where she comes; you shall perceive her behaviour.  DAUGHTER. I have forgot it quite. The burden on ’t was “Down-a, down-a,” and penned by no worse man than Geraldo, Emilia’s schoolmaster. He’s as fantastical, too, as ever he may go upon’s legs, for in the next world will Dido see Palamon, and then will she be out of love with Æneas.  DOCTOR. What stuff’s here? Poor soul!  JAILER. Even thus all day long.  DAUGHTER. Now for this charm that I told you of: you must bring a piece of silver on the tip of your tongue, or no ferry. Then if it be your chance to come where the blessed spirits are, there’s a sight now! We maids that have our livers perished, cracked to pieces with love, we shall come there, and do nothing all day long but pick flowers with Proserpine. Then will I make Palamon a nosegay; then let him mark me—then.  DOCTOR. How prettily she’s amiss! Note her a little further.  DAUGHTER. Faith, I’ll tell you, sometime we go to barley-break, we of the blessed. Alas, ’tis a sore life they have i’ th’ other place—such burning, frying, boiling, hissing, howling, chattering, cursing—O, they have shrewd measure; take heed! If one be mad, or hang or drown themselves, thither they go; Jupiter bless us! And there shall we be put in a cauldron of lead and usurers’ grease, amongst a whole million of cutpurses, and there boil like a gammon of bacon that will never be enough.  DOCTOR. How her brain coins!  DAUGHTER. Lords and courtiers that have got maids with child, they are in this place. They shall stand in fire up to the navel and in ice up to the heart, and there th’ offending part burns and the deceiving part freezes. In troth, a very grievous punishment, as one would think, for such a trifle. Believe me, one would marry a leprous witch to be rid on ’t, I’ll assure you.  DOCTOR. How she continues this fancy! ’Tis not an engraffed madness, but a most thick, and profound melancholy.  DAUGHTER. To hear there a proud lady and a proud city wife howl together! I were a beast an I’d call it good sport. One cries “O this smoke!” th’ other, “This fire!”; one cries, “O, that ever I did it behind the arras!” and then howls; th’ other curses a suing fellow and her garden house.  [_Sings._]     _I will be true, my stars, my fate, &c._  [_Exit Jailer’s Daughter._]  JAILER. What think you of her, sir?  DOCTOR. I think she has a perturbed mind, which I cannot minister to.  JAILER. Alas, what then?  DOCTOR. Understand you she ever affected any man ere she beheld Palamon?  JAILER. I was once, sir, in great hope she had fixed her liking on this gentleman, my friend.  WOOER. I did think so too, and would account I had a great penn’orth on’t, to give half my state, that both she and I at this present stood unfeignedly on the same terms.  DOCTOR. That intemperate surfeit of her eye hath distempered the other senses. They may return and settle again to execute their preordained faculties, but they are now in a most extravagant vagary. This you must do: confine her to a place where the light may rather seem to steal in than be permitted. Take upon you, young sir, her friend, the name of Palamon; say you come to eat with her, and to commune of love. This will catch her attention, for this her mind beats upon; other objects that are inserted ’tween her mind and eye become the pranks and friskins of her madness. Sing to her such green songs of love as she says Palamon hath sung in prison. Come to her stuck in as sweet flowers as the season is mistress of, and thereto make an addition of some other compounded odours which are grateful to the sense. All this shall become Palamon, for Palamon can sing, and Palamon is sweet and every good thing. Desire to eat with her, carve her, drink to her, and still among intermingle your petition of grace and acceptance into her favour. Learn what maids have been her companions and play-feres, and let them repair to her with Palamon in their mouths, and appear with tokens, as if they suggested for him. It is a falsehood she is in, which is with falsehoods to be combated. This may bring her to eat, to sleep, and reduce what’s now out of square in her into their former law and regiment. I have seen it approved, how many times I know not, but to make the number more I have great hope in this. I will, between the passages of this project, come in with my appliance. Let us put it in execution and hasten the success, which, doubt not, will bring forth comfort.  [_Exeunt._]
  ACT V  SCENE I. Athens. Before the Temples of Mars, Venus, and Diana
Flourish. Enter Theseus, Pirithous, Hippolyta and Attendants.  THESEUS. Now let ’em enter and before the gods Tender their holy prayers. Let the temples Burn bright with sacred fires, and the altars In hallowed clouds commend their swelling incense To those above us. Let no due be wanting. They have a noble work in hand, will honour The very powers that love ’em.  PIRITHOUS. Sir, they enter.  Enter Palamon and Arcite and their Knights.  THESEUS. You valiant and strong-hearted enemies, You royal german foes, that this day come To blow that nearness out that flames between ye, Lay by your anger for an hour and, dove-like, Before the holy altars of your helpers, The all-feared gods, bow down your stubborn bodies. Your ire is more than mortal; so your help be; And, as the gods regard ye, fight with justice. I’ll leave you to your prayers, and betwixt ye I part my wishes.  PIRITHOUS. Honour crown the worthiest.  [_Exeunt Theseus and his Train._]  PALAMON. The glass is running now that cannot finish Till one of us expire. Think you but thus, That were there aught in me which strove to show Mine enemy in this business, were ’t one eye Against another, arm oppressed by arm, I would destroy th’ offender, coz, I would Though parcel of myself. Then from this gather How I should tender you.  ARCITE. I am in labour To push your name, your ancient love, our kindred Out of my memory, and i’ th’ selfsame place To seat something I would confound. So hoist we The sails that must these vessels port even where The heavenly limiter pleases.  PALAMON. You speak well. Before I turn, let me embrace thee, cousin. This I shall never do again.  ARCITE. One farewell.  PALAMON. Why, let it be so. Farewell, coz.  ARCITE. Farewell, sir.  [_Exeunt Palamon and his Knights._]  Knights, kinsmen, lovers, yea, my sacrifices, True worshippers of Mars, whose spirit in you Expels the seeds of fear and th’ apprehension Which still is father of it, go with me Before the god of our profession. There Require of him the hearts of lions and The breath of tigers, yea, the fierceness too, Yea, the speed also—to go on, I mean; Else wish we to be snails. You know my prize Must be dragged out of blood; force and great feat Must put my garland on, where she sticks, The queen of flowers. Our intercession, then, Must be to him that makes the camp a cistern Brimmed with the blood of men. Give me your aid, And bend your spirits towards him.  [_They advance to the altar of Mars, fall on their faces before it, and then kneel._]  Thou mighty one, that with thy power hast turned Green Neptune into purple; whose approach Comets prewarn, whose havoc in vast field Unearthed skulls proclaim; whose breath blows down The teeming Ceres’ foison, who dost pluck With hand armipotent from forth blue clouds The masoned turrets, that both mak’st and break’st The stony girths of cities; me thy pupil, Youngest follower of thy drum, instruct this day With military skill, that to thy laud I may advance my streamer, and by thee Be styled the lord o’ th’ day. Give me, great Mars, Some token of thy pleasure.  [_Here they fall on their faces as formerly, and there is heard clanging of armour, with a short thunder, as the burst of a battle, whereupon they all rise and bow to the altar._]  O, great corrector of enormous times, Shaker of o’er-rank states, thou grand decider Of dusty and old titles, that heal’st with blood The earth when it is sick, and cur’st the world O’ th’ pleurisy of people; I do take Thy signs auspiciously, and in thy name To my design march boldly.—Let us go.  [_Exeunt._]  Enter Palamon and his Knights, with the former observance.  PALAMON. Our stars must glister with new fire, or be Today extinct. Our argument is love, Which, if the goddess of it grant, she gives Victory too. Then blend your spirits with mine, You whose free nobleness do make my cause Your personal hazard. To the goddess Venus Commend we our proceeding, and implore Her power unto our party.  [_Here they kneel as formerly._]  Hail, sovereign queen of secrets, who hast power To call the fiercest tyrant from his rage And weep unto a girl; that hast the might Even with an eye-glance to choke Mars’s drum And turn th’ alarm to whispers; that canst make A cripple flourish with his crutch, and cure him Before Apollo; that mayst force the king To be his subject’s vassal, and induce Stale gravity to dance. The polled bachelor, Whose youth, like wanton boys through bonfires, Have skipped thy flame, at seventy thou canst catch, And make him, to the scorn of his hoarse throat, Abuse young lays of love. What godlike power Hast thou not power upon? To Phœbus thou Add’st flames hotter than his; the heavenly fires Did scorch his mortal son, thine him. The huntress, All moist and cold, some say, began to throw Her bow away and sigh. Take to thy grace Me, thy vowed soldier, who do bear thy yoke As ’twere a wreath of roses, yet is heavier Than lead itself, stings more than nettles. I have never been foul-mouthed against thy law, Ne’er revealed secret, for I knew none—would not, Had I kenned all that were. I never practised Upon man’s wife, nor would the libels read Of liberal wits. I never at great feasts Sought to betray a beauty, but have blushed At simpering sirs that did. I have been harsh To large confessors, and have hotly asked them If they had mothers—I had one, a woman, And women ’twere they wronged. I knew a man Of eighty winters, this I told them, who A lass of fourteen brided; ’twas thy power To put life into dust. The aged cramp Had screwed his square foot round; The gout had knit his fingers into knots, Torturing convulsions from his globy eyes Had almost drawn their spheres, that what was life In him seemed torture. This anatomy Had by his young fair fere a boy, and I Believed it was his, for she swore it was, And who would not believe her? Brief, I am To those that prate and have done, no companion; To those that boast and have not, a defier; To those that would and cannot, a rejoicer. Yea, him I do not love that tells close offices The foulest way, nor names concealments in The boldest language. Such a one I am, And vow that lover never yet made sigh Truer than I. O, then, most soft sweet goddess, Give me the victory of this question, which Is true love’s merit, and bless me with a sign Of thy great pleasure.  [_Here music is heard; doves are seen to flutter. They fall again upon their faces, then on their knees._]  O thou that from eleven to ninety reign’st In mortal bosoms, whose chase is this world And we in herds thy game, I give thee thanks For this fair token, which being laid unto Mine innocent true heart, arms in assurance My body to this business.—Let us rise And bow before the goddess.  [_They rise and bow._]  Time comes on.  [_Exeunt._]  Still music of recorders. Enter Emilia in white, her hair about her shoulders, wearing a wheaten wreath. One in white holding up her train, her hair stuck with flowers. One before her carrying a silver hind, in which is conveyed incense and sweet odours, which being set upon the altar of  Diana, her maids standing aloof, she sets fire to it; then they curtsy and kneel.  EMILIA. O sacred, shadowy, cold, and constant queen, Abandoner of revels, mute contemplative, Sweet, solitary, white as chaste, and pure As wind-fanned snow, who to thy female knights Allow’st no more blood than will make a blush, Which is their order’s robe, I here, thy priest, Am humbled ’fore thine altar. O, vouchsafe With that thy rare green eye, which never yet Beheld thing maculate, look on thy virgin; And, sacred silver mistress, lend thine ear, Which ne’er heard scurrile term, into whose port Ne’er entered wanton sound, to my petition, Seasoned with holy fear. This is my last Of vestal office. I am bride-habited But maiden-hearted. A husband I have ’pointed, But do not know him. Out of two I should Choose one, and pray for his success, but I Am guiltless of election. Of mine eyes, Were I to lose one, they are equal precious; I could doom neither; that which perished should Go to ’t unsentenced. Therefore, most modest queen, He of the two pretenders that best loves me And has the truest title in ’t, let him Take off my wheaten garland, or else grant The file and quality I hold I may Continue in thy band.  [_Here the hind vanishes under the altar, and in the place ascends a rose tree, having one rose upon it._]   See what our general of ebbs and flows Out from the bowels of her holy altar With sacred act advances: but one rose! If well inspired, this battle shall confound Both these brave knights, and I, a virgin flower, Must grow alone, unplucked.  [_Here is heard a sudden twang of instruments, and the rose falls from the tree._]  The flower is fall’n, the tree descends. O mistress, Thou here dischargest me. I shall be gathered; I think so, but I know not thine own will. Unclasp thy mystery!—I hope she’s pleased; Her signs were gracious.  [_They curtsy and exeunt._]  SCENE II. Athens. A Room in the Prison  Enter Doctor, Jailer and Wooer in the habit of Palamon.  DOCTOR. Has this advice I told you, done any good upon her?  WOOER. O, very much. The maids that kept her company Have half persuaded her that I am Palamon; Within this half-hour she came smiling to me, And asked me what I would eat, and when I would kiss her. I told her “Presently,” and kissed her twice.  DOCTOR. ’Twas well done. Twenty times had been far better, For there the cure lies mainly.  WOOER. Then she told me She would watch with me tonight, for well she knew What hour my fit would take me.  DOCTOR. Let her do so, And when your fit comes, fit her home, and presently.  WOOER. She would have me sing.  DOCTOR. You did so?  WOOER. No.  DOCTOR. ’Twas very ill done, then; You should observe her every way.  WOOER. Alas, I have no voice, sir, to confirm her that way.  DOCTOR. That’s all one, if ye make a noise. If she entreat again, do anything. Lie with her, if she ask you.  JAILER. Hoa, there, doctor!  DOCTOR. Yes, in the way of cure.  JAILER. But first, by your leave, I’ th’ way of honesty.  DOCTOR. That’s but a niceness, Ne’er cast your child away for honesty. Cure her first this way; then if she will be honest, She has the path before her.  JAILER. Thank ye, Doctor.  DOCTOR. Pray, bring her in, And let’s see how she is.  JAILER. I will, and tell her Her Palamon stays for her. But, Doctor, Methinks you are i’ th’ wrong still.  [_Exit Jailer._]  DOCTOR. Go, go; You fathers are fine fools. Her honesty? An we should give her physic till we find that!  WOOER. Why, do you think she is not honest, sir?  DOCTOR. How old is she?  WOOER. She’s eighteen.  DOCTOR. She may be, But that’s all one; ’tis nothing to our purpose. Whate’er her father says, if you perceive Her mood inclining that way that I spoke of, _Videlicet_, the way of flesh—you have me?  WOOER. Yes, very well, sir.  DOCTOR. Please her appetite, And do it home; it cures her, _ipso facto_, The melancholy humour that infects her.  WOOER. I am of your mind, Doctor.  Enter Jailer, Jailer’s Daughter and Maid.  DOCTOR. You’ll find it so. She comes, pray, humour her.  JAILER. Come, your love Palamon stays for you, child, And has done this long hour, to visit you.  DAUGHTER. I thank him for his gentle patience; He’s a kind gentleman, and I am much bound to him. Did you ne’er see the horse he gave me?  JAILER. Yes.  DAUGHTER. How do you like him?  JAILER. He’s a very fair one.  DAUGHTER. You never saw him dance?  JAILER. No.  DAUGHTER. I have often. He dances very finely, very comely, And for a jig, come cut and long tail to him, He turns ye like a top.  JAILER. That’s fine, indeed.  DAUGHTER. He’ll dance the morris twenty mile an hour, And that will founder the best hobby-horse If I have any skill in all the parish, And gallops to the tune of “Light o’ love.” What think you of this horse?  JAILER. Having these virtues, I think he might be brought to play at tennis.  DAUGHTER. Alas, that’s nothing.  JAILER. Can he write and read too?  DAUGHTER. A very fair hand, and casts himself th’ accounts Of all his hay and provender. That hostler Must rise betime that cozens him. You know The chestnut mare the Duke has?  JAILER. Very well.  DAUGHTER. She is horribly in love with him, poor beast; But he is like his master, coy and scornful.  JAILER. What dowry has she?  DAUGHTER. Some two hundred bottles, And twenty strike of oates; but he’ll ne’er have her. He lisps in’s neighing, able to entice A miller’s mare. He’ll be the death of her.  DOCTOR. What stuff she utters!  JAILER. Make curtsy; here your love comes.  Enter Wooer and Doctor come forward.  WOOER. Pretty soul, How do ye? That’s a fine maid; there’s a curtsy!  DAUGHTER. Yours to command i’ th’ way of honesty. How far is’t now to’ th’ end o’ th’ world, my masters?  DOCTOR. Why, a day’s journey, wench.  DAUGHTER. Will you go with me?  WOOER. What shall we do there, wench?  DAUGHTER. Why, play at stool-ball; What is there else to do?  WOOER. I am content, If we shall keep our wedding there.  DAUGHTER. ’Tis true, For there, I will assure you, we shall find Some blind priest for the purpose, that will venture To marry us, for here they are nice and foolish. Besides, my father must be hanged tomorrow, And that would be a blot i’ th’ business. Are not you Palamon?  WOOER. Do not you know me?  DAUGHTER. Yes, but you care not for me. I have nothing But this poor petticoat, and two coarse smocks.  WOOER. That’s all one; I will have you.  DAUGHTER. Will you surely?  WOOER. [_Taking her hand._] Yes, by this fair hand, will I.  DAUGHTER. We’ll to bed, then.  WOOER. E’en when you will.  [_Kisses her._]  DAUGHTER. [_Rubs off the kiss._] O sir, you would fain be nibbling.  WOOER. Why do you rub my kiss off?  DAUGHTER. ’Tis a sweet one, And will perfume me finely against the wedding. Is not this your cousin Arcite?  [_She indicates the Doctor._]  DOCTOR. Yes, sweetheart, And I am glad my cousin Palamon Has made so fair a choice.  DAUGHTER. Do you think he’ll have me?  DOCTOR. Yes, without doubt.  DAUGHTER. Do you think so too?  JAILER. Yes.  DAUGHTER. We shall have many children. [_To Doctor._] Lord, how you’re grown! My Palamon, I hope, will grow too, finely, Now he’s at liberty. Alas, poor chicken, He was kept down with hard meat and ill lodging, But I’ll kiss him up again.  Enter a Messenger.  MESSENGER. What do you here? You’ll lose the noblest sight That e’er was seen.  JAILER. Are they i’ th’ field?  MESSENGER. They are. You bear a charge there too.  JAILER. I’ll away straight. I must e’en leave you here.  DOCTOR. Nay, we’ll go with you; I will not lose the sight.  JAILER. How did you like her?  DOCTOR. I’ll warrant you, within these three or four days I’ll make her right again. You must not from her, But still preserve her in this way.  WOOER. I will.  DOCTOR. Let’s get her in.  WOOER. Come, sweet, we’ll go to dinner; And then we’ll play at cards.  DAUGHTER. And shall we kiss too?  WOOER. A hundred times.  DAUGHTER. And twenty.  WOOER. Ay, and twenty.  DAUGHTER. And then we’ll sleep together.  DOCTOR. Take her offer.  WOOER. Yes, marry, will we.  DAUGHTER. But you shall not hurt me.  WOOER. I will not, sweet.  DAUGHTER. If you do, love, I’ll cry.  [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. A part of the Forest near Athens, and near the Place appointed for the Combat  Flourish. Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Emilia, Pirithous and some Attendants.  EMILIA. I’ll no step further.  PIRITHOUS. Will you lose this sight?  EMILIA. I had rather see a wren hawk at a fly Than this decision. Every blow that falls Threats a brave life; each stroke laments The place whereon it falls, and sounds more like A bell than blade. I will stay here. It is enough my hearing shall be punished With what shall happen, ’gainst the which there is No deafing, but to hear; not taint mine eye With dread sights it may shun.  PIRITHOUS. Sir, my good lord, Your sister will no further.  THESEUS. O, she must. She shall see deeds of honour in their kind, Which sometime show well, penciled. Nature now Shall make and act the story, the belief Both sealed with eye and ear. You must be present; You are the victor’s meed, the price and garland To crown the question’s title.  EMILIA. Pardon me; If I were there, I’d wink.  THESEUS. You must be there; This trial is as ’twere i’ th’ night, and you The only star to shine.  EMILIA. I am extinct. There is but envy in that light which shows The one the other. Darkness, which ever was The dam of horror, who does stand accursed Of many mortal millions, may even now, By casting her black mantle over both, That neither could find other, get herself Some part of a good name, and many a murder Set off whereto she’s guilty.  HIPPOLYTA. You must go.  EMILIA. In faith, I will not.  THESEUS. Why, the knights must kindle Their valour at your eye. Know, of this war You are the treasure, and must needs be by To give the service pay.  EMILIA. Sir, pardon me; The title of a kingdom may be tried Out of itself.  THESEUS. Well, well, then, at your pleasure. Those that remain with you could wish their office To any of their enemies.  HIPPOLYTA. Farewell, sister. I am like to know your husband ’fore yourself By some small start of time. He whom the gods Do of the two know best, I pray them he Be made your lot.  [_Exeunt all but Emilia._]  EMILIA. Arcite is gently visaged, yet his eye Is like an engine bent, or a sharp weapon In a soft sheath; mercy and manly courage Are bedfellows in his visage. Palamon Has a most menacing aspect; his brow Is graved, and seems to bury what it frowns on; Yet sometimes ’tis not so, but alters to The quality of his thoughts. Long time his eye Will dwell upon his object. Melancholy Becomes him nobly; so does Arcite’s mirth; But Palamon’s sadness is a kind of mirth, So mingled as if mirth did make him sad And sadness merry. Those darker humours that Stick misbecomingly on others, on them Live in fair dwelling.  [_Cornets. Trumpets sound as to a charge._]  Hark how yon spurs to spirit do incite The princes to their proof! Arcite may win me And yet may Palamon wound Arcite to The spoiling of his figure. O, what pity Enough for such a chance? If I were by, I might do hurt, for they would glance their eyes Towards my seat, and in that motion might Omit a ward or forfeit an offence Which craved that very time. It is much better I am not there.  [_Cornets. A great cry and noise within crying “À Palamon!”_]  Oh better never born Than minister to such harm.  Enter Servant.  What is the chance?  SERVANT. The cry’s “À Palamon.”  EMILIA. Then he has won. ’Twas ever likely. He looked all grace and success, and he is Doubtless the prim’st of men. I prithee run And tell me how it goes.  [_Shout and cornets, crying “À Palamon!”_]  SERVANT. Still “Palamon.”  EMILIA. Run and enquire.  [_Exit Servant._]  Poor servant, thou hast lost. Upon my right side still I wore thy picture, Palamon’s on the left. Why so, I know not. I had no end in ’t else; chance would have it so. On the sinister side the heart lies; Palamon Had the best-boding chance.  [_Another cry and shout within, and cornets._]  This burst of clamour Is sure th’ end o’ th’ combat.  Enter Servant.  SERVANT. They said that Palamon had Arcite’s body Within an inch o’ th’ pyramid, that the cry Was general “À Palamon.” But anon, Th’ assistants made a brave redemption, and The two bold titlers at this instant are Hand to hand at it.  EMILIA. Were they metamorphosed Both into one—O, why? There were no woman Worth so composed a man! Their single share, Their nobleness peculiar to them, gives The prejudice of disparity, value’s shortness, To any lady breathing.  [_Cornets. Cry within, “Arcite, Arcite.”_]  More exulting? “Palamon” still?  SERVANT. Nay, now the sound is “Arcite.”  EMILIA. I prithee, lay attention to the cry; Set both thine ears to th’ business.  [_Cornets. A great shout and cry “Arcite, victory!”_]
  EPILOGUE
Enter Epilogue.  EPILOGUE  I would now ask ye how you like the play, But, as it is with schoolboys, cannot say. I am cruel fearful! Pray yet, stay a while, And let me look upon ye. No man smile? Then it goes hard, I see. He that has Loved a young handsome wench, then, show his face— ’Tis strange if none be here—and, if he will, Against his conscience let him hiss, and kill Our market. ’Tis in vain, I see, to stay ye. Have at the worst can come, then! Now what say ye? And yet mistake me not: I am not bold; We have no such cause. If the tale we have told For ’tis no other—any way content ye— For to that honest purpose it was meant ye— We have our end; and you shall have ere long, I dare say, many a better, to prolong Your old loves to us. We, and all our might, Rest at your service. Gentlemen, good night.  [_Flourish. Exit._]  FINIS

  ACT I  SCENE I. Sicilia. An Antechamber in Leontes’ Palace.   Enter Camillo and Archidamus.  ARCHIDAMUS. If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on the like occasion whereon my services are now on foot, you shall see, as I have said, great difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.  CAMILLO. I think this coming summer the King of Sicilia means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.  ARCHIDAMUS. Wherein our entertainment shall shame us; we will be justified in our loves. For indeed,—  CAMILLO. Beseech you—  ARCHIDAMUS. Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge. We cannot with such magnificence—in so rare—I know not what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks, that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience, may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse us.  CAMILLO. You pay a great deal too dear for what’s given freely.  ARCHIDAMUS. Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.  CAMILLO. Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia. They were trained together in their childhoods, and there rooted betwixt them then such an affection which cannot choose but branch now. Since their more mature dignities and royal necessities made separation of their society, their encounters, though not personal, have been royally attorneyed with interchange of gifts, letters, loving embassies, that they have seemed to be together, though absent; shook hands, as over a vast; and embraced as it were from the ends of opposed winds. The heavens continue their loves!  ARCHIDAMUS. I think there is not in the world either malice or matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable comfort of your young Prince Mamillius. It is a gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came into my note.  CAMILLO. I very well agree with you in the hopes of him. It is a gallant child; one that indeed physics the subject, makes old hearts fresh. They that went on crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to see him a man.  ARCHIDAMUS. Would they else be content to die?  CAMILLO. Yes, if there were no other excuse why they should desire to live.  ARCHIDAMUS. If the king had no son, they would desire to live on crutches till he had one.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. The same. A Room of State in the Palace.   Enter Leontes, Polixenes, Hermione, Mamillius, Camillo and Attendants.  POLIXENES. Nine changes of the watery star hath been The shepherd’s note since we have left our throne Without a burden. Time as long again Would be fill’d up, my brother, with our thanks; And yet we should, for perpetuity, Go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher, Yet standing in rich place, I multiply With one “we thank you” many thousands more That go before it.  LEONTES. Stay your thanks a while, And pay them when you part.  POLIXENES. Sir, that’s tomorrow. I am question’d by my fears, of what may chance Or breed upon our absence; that may blow No sneaping winds at home, to make us say “This is put forth too truly.” Besides, I have stay’d To tire your royalty.  LEONTES. We are tougher, brother, Than you can put us to ’t.  POLIXENES. No longer stay.  LEONTES. One seve’night longer.  POLIXENES. Very sooth, tomorrow.  LEONTES. We’ll part the time between ’s then: and in that I’ll no gainsaying.  POLIXENES. Press me not, beseech you, so, There is no tongue that moves, none, none i’ th’ world, So soon as yours, could win me: so it should now, Were there necessity in your request, although ’Twere needful I denied it. My affairs Do even drag me homeward: which to hinder Were, in your love a whip to me; my stay To you a charge and trouble: to save both, Farewell, our brother.  LEONTES. Tongue-tied, our queen? Speak you.  HERMIONE. I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until You had drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir, Charge him too coldly. Tell him you are sure All in Bohemia’s well: this satisfaction The by-gone day proclaimed. Say this to him, He’s beat from his best ward.  LEONTES. Well said, Hermione.  HERMIONE. To tell he longs to see his son were strong. But let him say so then, and let him go; But let him swear so, and he shall not stay, We’ll thwack him hence with distaffs. [_To Polixenes._] Yet of your royal presence I’ll adventure The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia You take my lord, I’ll give him my commission To let him there a month behind the gest Prefix’d for’s parting:—yet, good deed, Leontes, I love thee not a jar of th’ clock behind What lady she her lord. You’ll stay?  POLIXENES. No, madam.  HERMIONE. Nay, but you will?  POLIXENES. I may not, verily.  HERMIONE. Verily! You put me off with limber vows; but I, Though you would seek t’ unsphere the stars with oaths, Should yet say “Sir, no going.” Verily, You shall not go. A lady’s verily is As potent as a lord’s. Will go yet? Force me to keep you as a prisoner, Not like a guest: so you shall pay your fees When you depart, and save your thanks. How say you? My prisoner or my guest? By your dread “verily,” One of them you shall be.  POLIXENES. Your guest, then, madam. To be your prisoner should import offending; Which is for me less easy to commit Than you to punish.  HERMIONE. Not your gaoler then, But your kind hostess. Come, I’ll question you Of my lord’s tricks and yours when you were boys. You were pretty lordings then.  POLIXENES. We were, fair queen, Two lads that thought there was no more behind But such a day tomorrow as today, And to be boy eternal.  HERMIONE. Was not my lord The verier wag o’ th’ two?  POLIXENES. We were as twinn’d lambs that did frisk i’ th’ sun And bleat the one at th’ other. What we chang’d Was innocence for innocence; we knew not The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream’d That any did. Had we pursu’d that life, And our weak spirits ne’er been higher rear’d With stronger blood, we should have answer’d heaven Boldly “Not guilty,” the imposition clear’d Hereditary ours.  HERMIONE. By this we gather You have tripp’d since.  POLIXENES. O my most sacred lady, Temptations have since then been born to ’s! for In those unfledg’d days was my wife a girl; Your precious self had then not cross’d the eyes Of my young play-fellow.  HERMIONE. Grace to boot! Of this make no conclusion, lest you say Your queen and I are devils. Yet go on; Th’ offences we have made you do we’ll answer, If you first sinn’d with us, and that with us You did continue fault, and that you slipp’d not With any but with us.  LEONTES. Is he won yet?  HERMIONE. He’ll stay, my lord.  LEONTES. At my request he would not. Hermione, my dearest, thou never spok’st To better purpose.  HERMIONE. Never?  LEONTES. Never but once.  HERMIONE. What! have I twice said well? when was’t before? I prithee tell me. Cram ’s with praise, and make ’s As fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that. Our praises are our wages. You may ride ’s With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere With spur we heat an acre. But to th’ goal: My last good deed was to entreat his stay. What was my first? It has an elder sister, Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace! But once before I spoke to the purpose—when? Nay, let me have’t; I long.  LEONTES. Why, that was when Three crabbed months had sour’d themselves to death, Ere I could make thee open thy white hand And clap thyself my love; then didst thou utter “I am yours for ever.”  HERMIONE. ’Tis Grace indeed. Why, lo you now, I have spoke to th’ purpose twice. The one for ever earn’d a royal husband; Th’ other for some while a friend.   [_Giving her hand to Polixenes._]  LEONTES. [_Aside._] Too hot, too hot! To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods. I have _tremor cordis_ on me. My heart dances, But not for joy,—not joy. This entertainment May a free face put on, derive a liberty From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom, And well become the agent: ’t may, I grant: But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers, As now they are, and making practis’d smiles As in a looking-glass; and then to sigh, as ’twere The mort o’ th’ deer. O, that is entertainment My bosom likes not, nor my brows. Mamillius, Art thou my boy?  MAMILLIUS. Ay, my good lord.  LEONTES. I’ fecks! Why, that’s my bawcock. What! hast smutch’d thy nose? They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain, We must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain: And yet the steer, the heifer, and the calf Are all call’d neat.—Still virginalling Upon his palm?—How now, you wanton calf! Art thou my calf?  MAMILLIUS. Yes, if you will, my lord.  LEONTES. Thou want’st a rough pash and the shoots that I have To be full like me:—yet they say we are Almost as like as eggs; women say so, That will say anything. But were they false As o’er-dy’d blacks, as wind, as waters, false As dice are to be wish’d by one that fixes No bourn ’twixt his and mine, yet were it true To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page, Look on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain! Most dear’st! my collop! Can thy dam?—may’t be? Affection! thy intention stabs the centre: Thou dost make possible things not so held, Communicat’st with dreams;—how can this be?— With what’s unreal thou coactive art, And fellow’st nothing: then ’tis very credent Thou may’st co-join with something; and thou dost, And that beyond commission, and I find it, And that to the infection of my brains And hardening of my brows.  POLIXENES. What means Sicilia?  HERMIONE. He something seems unsettled.  POLIXENES. How, my lord? What cheer? How is’t with you, best brother?  HERMIONE. You look As if you held a brow of much distraction: Are you mov’d, my lord?  LEONTES. No, in good earnest. How sometimes nature will betray its folly, Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines Of my boy’s face, methoughts I did recoil Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech’d, In my green velvet coat; my dagger muzzled Lest it should bite its master, and so prove, As ornaments oft do, too dangerous. How like, methought, I then was to this kernel, This squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend, Will you take eggs for money?  MAMILLIUS. No, my lord, I’ll fight.  LEONTES. You will? Why, happy man be ’s dole! My brother, Are you so fond of your young prince as we Do seem to be of ours?  POLIXENES. If at home, sir, He’s all my exercise, my mirth, my matter: Now my sworn friend, and then mine enemy; My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all. He makes a July’s day short as December; And with his varying childness cures in me Thoughts that would thick my blood.  LEONTES. So stands this squire Offic’d with me. We two will walk, my lord, And leave you to your graver steps. Hermione, How thou lov’st us show in our brother’s welcome; Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap: Next to thyself and my young rover, he’s Apparent to my heart.  HERMIONE. If you would seek us, We are yours i’ the garden. Shall ’s attend you there?  LEONTES. To your own bents dispose you: you’ll be found, Be you beneath the sky. [_Aside._] I am angling now, Though you perceive me not how I give line. Go to, go to! How she holds up the neb, the bill to him! And arms her with the boldness of a wife To her allowing husband!   [_Exeunt Polixenes, Hermione and Attendants._]  Gone already! Inch-thick, knee-deep, o’er head and ears a fork’d one!— Go, play, boy, play. Thy mother plays, and I Play too; but so disgrac’d a part, whose issue Will hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour Will be my knell. Go, play, boy, play. There have been, Or I am much deceiv’d, cuckolds ere now; And many a man there is, even at this present, Now while I speak this, holds his wife by th’ arm, That little thinks she has been sluic’d in ’s absence, And his pond fish’d by his next neighbour, by Sir Smile, his neighbour. Nay, there’s comfort in ’t, Whiles other men have gates, and those gates open’d, As mine, against their will. Should all despair That hath revolted wives, the tenth of mankind Would hang themselves. Physic for’t there’s none; It is a bawdy planet, that will strike Where ’tis predominant; and ’tis powerful, think it, From east, west, north, and south. Be it concluded, No barricado for a belly. Know’t; It will let in and out the enemy With bag and baggage. Many thousand of us Have the disease, and feel’t not.—How now, boy!  MAMILLIUS. I am like you, they say.  LEONTES. Why, that’s some comfort. What! Camillo there?  CAMILLO. Ay, my good lord.  LEONTES. Go play, Mamillius; thou’rt an honest man.   [_Exit Mamillius._]  Camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.  CAMILLO. You had much ado to make his anchor hold: When you cast out, it still came home.  LEONTES. Didst note it?  CAMILLO. He would not stay at your petitions; made His business more material.  LEONTES. Didst perceive it? [_Aside._] They’re here with me already; whisp’ring, rounding, “Sicilia is a so-forth.” ’Tis far gone When I shall gust it last.—How came’t, Camillo, That he did stay?  CAMILLO. At the good queen’s entreaty.  LEONTES. At the queen’s be’t: “good” should be pertinent, But so it is, it is not. Was this taken By any understanding pate but thine? For thy conceit is soaking, will draw in More than the common blocks. Not noted, is’t, But of the finer natures? by some severals Of head-piece extraordinary? lower messes Perchance are to this business purblind? say.  CAMILLO. Business, my lord? I think most understand Bohemia stays here longer.  LEONTES. Ha?  CAMILLO. Stays here longer.  LEONTES. Ay, but why?  CAMILLO. To satisfy your highness, and the entreaties Of our most gracious mistress.  LEONTES. Satisfy? Th’ entreaties of your mistress? Satisfy? Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo, With all the nearest things to my heart, as well My chamber-counsels, wherein, priest-like, thou Hast cleans’d my bosom; I from thee departed Thy penitent reform’d. But we have been Deceiv’d in thy integrity, deceiv’d In that which seems so.  CAMILLO. Be it forbid, my lord!  LEONTES. To bide upon’t: thou art not honest; or, If thou inclin’st that way, thou art a coward, Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining From course requir’d; or else thou must be counted A servant grafted in my serious trust, And therein negligent; or else a fool That seest a game play’d home, the rich stake drawn, And tak’st it all for jest.  CAMILLO. My gracious lord, I may be negligent, foolish, and fearful; In every one of these no man is free, But that his negligence, his folly, fear, Among the infinite doings of the world, Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord, If ever I were wilful-negligent, It was my folly; if industriously I play’d the fool, it was my negligence, Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful To do a thing, where I the issue doubted, Whereof the execution did cry out Against the non-performance, ’twas a fear Which oft affects the wisest: these, my lord, Are such allow’d infirmities that honesty Is never free of. But, beseech your Grace, Be plainer with me; let me know my trespass By its own visage: if I then deny it, ’Tis none of mine.  LEONTES. Ha’ not you seen, Camillo? (But that’s past doubt: you have, or your eye-glass Is thicker than a cuckold’s horn) or heard? (For, to a vision so apparent, rumour Cannot be mute) or thought? (for cogitation Resides not in that man that does not think) My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess, Or else be impudently negative, To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say My wife’s a hobby-horse, deserves a name As rank as any flax-wench that puts to Before her troth-plight: say’t and justify’t.  CAMILLO. I would not be a stander-by to hear My sovereign mistress clouded so, without My present vengeance taken: ’shrew my heart, You never spoke what did become you less Than this; which to reiterate were sin As deep as that, though true.  LEONTES. Is whispering nothing? Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses? Kissing with inside lip? Stopping the career Of laughter with a sigh?—a note infallible Of breaking honesty?—horsing foot on foot? Skulking in corners? Wishing clocks more swift? Hours, minutes? Noon, midnight? and all eyes Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only, That would unseen be wicked? Is this nothing? Why, then the world and all that’s in’t is nothing, The covering sky is nothing, Bohemia nothing, My wife is nothing, nor nothing have these nothings, If this be nothing.  CAMILLO. Good my lord, be cur’d Of this diseas’d opinion, and betimes, For ’tis most dangerous.  LEONTES. Say it be, ’tis true.  CAMILLO. No, no, my lord.  LEONTES. It is; you lie, you lie: I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee, Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave, Or else a hovering temporizer that Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil, Inclining to them both. Were my wife’s liver Infected as her life, she would not live The running of one glass.  CAMILLO. Who does infect her?  LEONTES. Why, he that wears her like her medal, hanging About his neck, Bohemia: who, if I Had servants true about me, that bare eyes To see alike mine honour as their profits, Their own particular thrifts, they would do that Which should undo more doing: ay, and thou, His cupbearer,—whom I from meaner form Have bench’d and rear’d to worship, who mayst see Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven, How I am galled,—mightst bespice a cup, To give mine enemy a lasting wink; Which draught to me were cordial.  CAMILLO. Sir, my lord, I could do this, and that with no rash potion, But with a ling’ring dram, that should not work Maliciously like poison. But I cannot Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress, So sovereignly being honourable. I have lov’d thee,—  LEONTES. Make that thy question, and go rot! Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled, To appoint myself in this vexation; sully The purity and whiteness of my sheets, (Which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps) Give scandal to the blood o’ th’ prince, my son, (Who I do think is mine, and love as mine) Without ripe moving to’t? Would I do this? Could man so blench?  CAMILLO. I must believe you, sir: I do; and will fetch off Bohemia for’t; Provided that, when he’s remov’d, your highness Will take again your queen as yours at first, Even for your son’s sake, and thereby for sealing The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms Known and allied to yours.  LEONTES. Thou dost advise me Even so as I mine own course have set down: I’ll give no blemish to her honour, none.  CAMILLO. My lord, Go then; and with a countenance as clear As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia And with your queen. I am his cupbearer. If from me he have wholesome beverage, Account me not your servant.  LEONTES. This is all: Do’t, and thou hast the one half of my heart; Do’t not, thou splitt’st thine own.  CAMILLO. I’ll do’t, my lord.  LEONTES. I will seem friendly, as thou hast advis’d me.   [_Exit._]  CAMILLO. O miserable lady! But, for me, What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner Of good Polixenes, and my ground to do’t Is the obedience to a master; one Who, in rebellion with himself, will have All that are his so too. To do this deed, Promotion follows. If I could find example Of thousands that had struck anointed kings And flourish’d after, I’d not do’t. But since Nor brass, nor stone, nor parchment, bears not one, Let villainy itself forswear’t. I must Forsake the court: to do’t, or no, is certain To me a break-neck. Happy star reign now! Here comes Bohemia.   Enter Polixenes.  POLIXENES. This is strange. Methinks My favour here begins to warp. Not speak? Good day, Camillo.  CAMILLO. Hail, most royal sir!  POLIXENES. What is the news i’ th’ court?  CAMILLO. None rare, my lord.  POLIXENES. The king hath on him such a countenance As he had lost some province, and a region Lov’d as he loves himself. Even now I met him With customary compliment, when he, Wafting his eyes to the contrary, and falling A lip of much contempt, speeds from me, and So leaves me to consider what is breeding That changes thus his manners.  CAMILLO. I dare not know, my lord.  POLIXENES. How, dare not? Do not? Do you know, and dare not? Be intelligent to me? ’Tis thereabouts; For, to yourself, what you do know, you must, And cannot say you dare not. Good Camillo, Your chang’d complexions are to me a mirror Which shows me mine chang’d too; for I must be A party in this alteration, finding Myself thus alter’d with’t.  CAMILLO. There is a sickness Which puts some of us in distemper, but I cannot name the disease, and it is caught Of you that yet are well.  POLIXENES. How caught of me? Make me not sighted like the basilisk. I have look’d on thousands who have sped the better By my regard, but kill’d none so. Camillo,— As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto Clerk-like, experienc’d, which no less adorns Our gentry than our parents’ noble names, In whose success we are gentle,—I beseech you, If you know aught which does behove my knowledge Thereof to be inform’d, imprison’t not In ignorant concealment.  CAMILLO. I may not answer.  POLIXENES. A sickness caught of me, and yet I well? I must be answer’d. Dost thou hear, Camillo, I conjure thee, by all the parts of man Which honour does acknowledge, whereof the least Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare What incidency thou dost guess of harm Is creeping toward me; how far off, how near; Which way to be prevented, if to be; If not, how best to bear it.  CAMILLO. Sir, I will tell you; Since I am charg’d in honour, and by him That I think honourable. Therefore mark my counsel, Which must be ev’n as swiftly follow’d as I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me Cry lost, and so goodnight!  POLIXENES. On, good Camillo.  CAMILLO. I am appointed him to murder you.  POLIXENES. By whom, Camillo?  CAMILLO. By the king.  POLIXENES. For what?  CAMILLO. He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears, As he had seen’t or been an instrument To vice you to’t, that you have touch’d his queen Forbiddenly.  POLIXENES. O, then my best blood turn To an infected jelly, and my name Be yok’d with his that did betray the Best! Turn then my freshest reputation to A savour that may strike the dullest nostril Where I arrive, and my approach be shunn’d, Nay, hated too, worse than the great’st infection That e’er was heard or read!  CAMILLO. Swear his thought over By each particular star in heaven and By all their influences, you may as well Forbid the sea for to obey the moon As or by oath remove or counsel shake The fabric of his folly, whose foundation Is pil’d upon his faith, and will continue The standing of his body.  POLIXENES. How should this grow?  CAMILLO. I know not: but I am sure ’tis safer to Avoid what’s grown than question how ’tis born. If therefore you dare trust my honesty, That lies enclosed in this trunk, which you Shall bear along impawn’d, away tonight. Your followers I will whisper to the business, And will by twos and threes, at several posterns, Clear them o’ th’ city. For myself, I’ll put My fortunes to your service, which are here By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain, For, by the honour of my parents, I Have utter’d truth: which if you seek to prove, I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer Than one condemned by the king’s own mouth, Thereon his execution sworn.  POLIXENES. I do believe thee. I saw his heart in ’s face. Give me thy hand, Be pilot to me, and thy places shall Still neighbour mine. My ships are ready, and My people did expect my hence departure Two days ago. This jealousy Is for a precious creature: as she’s rare, Must it be great; and, as his person’s mighty, Must it be violent; and as he does conceive He is dishonour’d by a man which ever Profess’d to him, why, his revenges must In that be made more bitter. Fear o’ershades me. Good expedition be my friend, and comfort The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing Of his ill-ta’en suspicion! Come, Camillo, I will respect thee as a father if Thou bear’st my life off hence. Let us avoid.  CAMILLO. It is in mine authority to command The keys of all the posterns: please your highness To take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away.   [_Exeunt._]
 ACT II  SCENE I. Sicilia. A Room in the Palace.   Enter Hermione, Mamillius and Ladies.  HERMIONE. Take the boy to you: he so troubles me, ’Tis past enduring.  FIRST LADY. Come, my gracious lord, Shall I be your playfellow?  MAMILLIUS. No, I’ll none of you.  FIRST LADY. Why, my sweet lord?  MAMILLIUS. You’ll kiss me hard, and speak to me as if I were a baby still. I love you better.  SECOND LADY. And why so, my lord?  MAMILLIUS. Not for because Your brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say, Become some women best, so that there be not Too much hair there, but in a semicircle Or a half-moon made with a pen.  SECOND LADY. Who taught this?  MAMILLIUS. I learn’d it out of women’s faces. Pray now, What colour are your eyebrows?  FIRST LADY. Blue, my lord.  MAMILLIUS. Nay, that’s a mock. I have seen a lady’s nose That has been blue, but not her eyebrows.  FIRST LADY. Hark ye, The queen your mother rounds apace. We shall Present our services to a fine new prince One of these days, and then you’d wanton with us, If we would have you.  SECOND LADY. She is spread of late Into a goodly bulk: good time encounter her!  HERMIONE. What wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, now I am for you again. Pray you sit by us, And tell ’s a tale.  MAMILLIUS. Merry or sad shall’t be?  HERMIONE. As merry as you will.  MAMILLIUS. A sad tale’s best for winter. I have one Of sprites and goblins.  HERMIONE. Let’s have that, good sir. Come on, sit down. Come on, and do your best To fright me with your sprites: you’re powerful at it.  MAMILLIUS. There was a man,—  HERMIONE. Nay, come, sit down, then on.  MAMILLIUS. Dwelt by a churchyard. I will tell it softly, Yond crickets shall not hear it.  HERMIONE. Come on then, And give’t me in mine ear.   Enter Leontes, Antigonus, Lords and Guards.  LEONTES. Was he met there? his train? Camillo with him?  FIRST LORD. Behind the tuft of pines I met them, never Saw I men scour so on their way: I ey’d them Even to their ships.  LEONTES. How blest am I In my just censure, in my true opinion! Alack, for lesser knowledge! How accurs’d In being so blest! There may be in the cup A spider steep’d, and one may drink, depart, And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge Is not infected; but if one present Th’ abhorr’d ingredient to his eye, make known How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides, With violent hefts. I have drunk, and seen the spider. Camillo was his help in this, his pander. There is a plot against my life, my crown; All’s true that is mistrusted. That false villain Whom I employ’d, was pre-employ’d by him. He has discover’d my design, and I Remain a pinch’d thing; yea, a very trick For them to play at will. How came the posterns So easily open?  FIRST LORD. By his great authority, Which often hath no less prevail’d than so On your command.  LEONTES. I know’t too well. Give me the boy. I am glad you did not nurse him. Though he does bear some signs of me, yet you Have too much blood in him.  HERMIONE. What is this? sport?  LEONTES. Bear the boy hence, he shall not come about her, Away with him, and let her sport herself With that she’s big with; for ’tis Polixenes Has made thee swell thus.   [_Exit Mamillius with some of the Guards._]  HERMIONE. But I’d say he had not, And I’ll be sworn you would believe my saying, Howe’er you learn th’ nayward.  LEONTES. You, my lords, Look on her, mark her well. Be but about To say, “she is a goodly lady,” and The justice of your hearts will thereto add “’Tis pity she’s not honest, honourable”: Praise her but for this her without-door form, Which on my faith deserves high speech, and straight The shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands That calumny doth use—O, I am out, That mercy does; for calumny will sear Virtue itself—these shrugs, these hum’s, and ha’s, When you have said “she’s goodly,” come between, Ere you can say “she’s honest”: but be it known, From him that has most cause to grieve it should be, She’s an adultress!  HERMIONE. Should a villain say so, The most replenish’d villain in the world, He were as much more villain: you, my lord, Do but mistake.  LEONTES. You have mistook, my lady, Polixenes for Leontes. O thou thing, Which I’ll not call a creature of thy place, Lest barbarism, making me the precedent, Should a like language use to all degrees, And mannerly distinguishment leave out Betwixt the prince and beggar. I have said She’s an adultress; I have said with whom: More, she’s a traitor, and Camillo is A federary with her; and one that knows What she should shame to know herself But with her most vile principal, that she’s A bed-swerver, even as bad as those That vulgars give bold’st titles; ay, and privy To this their late escape.  HERMIONE. No, by my life, Privy to none of this. How will this grieve you, When you shall come to clearer knowledge, that You thus have publish’d me! Gentle my lord, You scarce can right me throughly then, to say You did mistake.  LEONTES. No. If I mistake In those foundations which I build upon, The centre is not big enough to bear A school-boy’s top. Away with her to prison! He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty But that he speaks.  HERMIONE. There’s some ill planet reigns: I must be patient till the heavens look With an aspect more favourable. Good my lords, I am not prone to weeping, as our sex Commonly are; the want of which vain dew Perchance shall dry your pities. But I have That honourable grief lodg’d here which burns Worse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords, With thoughts so qualified as your charities Shall best instruct you, measure me; and so The king’s will be perform’d.  LEONTES. Shall I be heard?  HERMIONE. Who is’t that goes with me? Beseech your highness My women may be with me, for you see My plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools; There is no cause: when you shall know your mistress Has deserv’d prison, then abound in tears As I come out: this action I now go on Is for my better grace. Adieu, my lord: I never wish’d to see you sorry; now I trust I shall. My women, come; you have leave.  LEONTES. Go, do our bidding. Hence!   [_Exeunt Queen and Ladies with Guards._]  FIRST LORD. Beseech your highness, call the queen again.  ANTIGONUS. Be certain what you do, sir, lest your justice Prove violence, in the which three great ones suffer, Yourself, your queen, your son.  FIRST LORD. For her, my lord, I dare my life lay down, and will do’t, sir, Please you to accept it, that the queen is spotless I’ th’ eyes of heaven and to you—I mean In this which you accuse her.  ANTIGONUS. If it prove She’s otherwise, I’ll keep my stables where I lodge my wife; I’ll go in couples with her; Than when I feel and see her no further trust her. For every inch of woman in the world, Ay, every dram of woman’s flesh, is false, If she be.  LEONTES. Hold your peaces.  FIRST LORD. Good my lord,—  ANTIGONUS. It is for you we speak, not for ourselves: You are abus’d, and by some putter-on That will be damn’d for’t: would I knew the villain, I would land-damn him. Be she honour-flaw’d, I have three daughters; the eldest is eleven; The second and the third, nine and some five; If this prove true, they’ll pay for’t. By mine honour, I’ll geld ’em all; fourteen they shall not see, To bring false generations: they are co-heirs, And I had rather glib myself than they Should not produce fair issue.  LEONTES. Cease; no more. You smell this business with a sense as cold As is a dead man’s nose: but I do see’t and feel’t, As you feel doing thus; and see withal The instruments that feel.  ANTIGONUS. If it be so, We need no grave to bury honesty. There’s not a grain of it the face to sweeten Of the whole dungy earth.  LEONTES. What! Lack I credit?  FIRST LORD. I had rather you did lack than I, my lord, Upon this ground: and more it would content me To have her honour true than your suspicion, Be blam’d for’t how you might.  LEONTES. Why, what need we Commune with you of this, but rather follow Our forceful instigation? Our prerogative Calls not your counsels, but our natural goodness Imparts this; which, if you, or stupified Or seeming so in skill, cannot or will not Relish a truth, like us, inform yourselves We need no more of your advice: the matter, The loss, the gain, the ord’ring on’t, is all Properly ours.  ANTIGONUS. And I wish, my liege, You had only in your silent judgement tried it, Without more overture.  LEONTES. How could that be? Either thou art most ignorant by age, Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo’s flight, Added to their familiarity, (Which was as gross as ever touch’d conjecture, That lack’d sight only, nought for approbation But only seeing, all other circumstances Made up to th’ deed) doth push on this proceeding. Yet, for a greater confirmation (For in an act of this importance, ’twere Most piteous to be wild), I have dispatch’d in post To sacred Delphos, to Apollo’s temple, Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know Of stuff’d sufficiency: now from the oracle They will bring all, whose spiritual counsel had, Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well?  FIRST LORD. Well done, my lord.  LEONTES. Though I am satisfied, and need no more Than what I know, yet shall the oracle Give rest to the minds of others, such as he Whose ignorant credulity will not Come up to th’ truth. So have we thought it good From our free person she should be confin’d, Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence Be left her to perform. Come, follow us; We are to speak in public; for this business Will raise us all.  ANTIGONUS. [_Aside._] To laughter, as I take it, If the good truth were known.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. The same. The outer Room of a Prison.   Enter Paulina, a Gentleman and Attendants.  PAULINA. The keeper of the prison, call to him; Let him have knowledge who I am.   [_Exit the Gentleman._]  Good lady! No court in Europe is too good for thee; What dost thou then in prison?   Enter Gentleman with the Gaoler.  Now, good sir, You know me, do you not?  GAOLER. For a worthy lady And one who much I honour.  PAULINA. Pray you then, Conduct me to the queen.  GAOLER. I may not, madam. To the contrary I have express commandment.  PAULINA. Here’s ado, to lock up honesty and honour from Th’ access of gentle visitors! Is’t lawful, pray you, To see her women? any of them? Emilia?  GAOLER. So please you, madam, To put apart these your attendants, I Shall bring Emilia forth.  PAULINA. I pray now, call her. Withdraw yourselves.   [_Exeunt Gentleman and Attendants._]  GAOLER. And, madam, I must be present at your conference.  PAULINA. Well, be’t so, prithee.   [_Exit Gaoler._]  Here’s such ado to make no stain a stain As passes colouring.   Re-enter Gaoler with Emilia.  Dear gentlewoman, How fares our gracious lady?  EMILIA. As well as one so great and so forlorn May hold together: on her frights and griefs, (Which never tender lady hath borne greater) She is, something before her time, deliver’d.  PAULINA. A boy?  EMILIA. A daughter; and a goodly babe, Lusty, and like to live: the queen receives Much comfort in ’t; says “My poor prisoner, I am as innocent as you.”  PAULINA. I dare be sworn. These dangerous unsafe lunes i’ th’ king, beshrew them! He must be told on’t, and he shall: the office Becomes a woman best. I’ll take’t upon me. If I prove honey-mouth’d, let my tongue blister, And never to my red-look’d anger be The trumpet any more. Pray you, Emilia, Commend my best obedience to the queen. If she dares trust me with her little babe, I’ll show’t the king, and undertake to be Her advocate to th’ loud’st. We do not know How he may soften at the sight o’ th’ child: The silence often of pure innocence Persuades, when speaking fails.  EMILIA. Most worthy madam, Your honour and your goodness is so evident, That your free undertaking cannot miss A thriving issue: there is no lady living So meet for this great errand. Please your ladyship To visit the next room, I’ll presently Acquaint the queen of your most noble offer, Who but today hammer’d of this design, But durst not tempt a minister of honour, Lest she should be denied.  PAULINA. Tell her, Emilia, I’ll use that tongue I have: if wit flow from ’t As boldness from my bosom, let’t not be doubted I shall do good.  EMILIA. Now be you blest for it! I’ll to the queen: please you come something nearer.  GAOLER. Madam, if ’t please the queen to send the babe, I know not what I shall incur to pass it, Having no warrant.  PAULINA. You need not fear it, sir: This child was prisoner to the womb, and is, By law and process of great nature thence Freed and enfranchis’d: not a party to The anger of the king, nor guilty of, If any be, the trespass of the queen.  GAOLER. I do believe it.  PAULINA. Do not you fear: upon mine honour, I Will stand betwixt you and danger.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. The same. A Room in the Palace.   Enter Leontes, Antigonus, Lords and other Attendants.  LEONTES. Nor night nor day no rest: it is but weakness To bear the matter thus, mere weakness. If The cause were not in being,—part o’ th’ cause, She th’ adultress; for the harlot king Is quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank And level of my brain, plot-proof. But she I can hook to me. Say that she were gone, Given to the fire, a moiety of my rest Might come to me again. Who’s there?  FIRST ATTENDANT. My lord.  LEONTES. How does the boy?  FIRST ATTENDANT. He took good rest tonight; ’Tis hop’d his sickness is discharg’d.  LEONTES. To see his nobleness, Conceiving the dishonour of his mother. He straight declin’d, droop’d, took it deeply, Fasten’d and fix’d the shame on’t in himself, Threw off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep, And downright languish’d. Leave me solely: go, See how he fares.   [_Exit First Attendant._]  Fie, fie! no thought of him. The very thought of my revenges that way Recoil upon me: in himself too mighty, And in his parties, his alliance. Let him be, Until a time may serve. For present vengeance, Take it on her. Camillo and Polixenes Laugh at me; make their pastime at my sorrow: They should not laugh if I could reach them, nor Shall she, within my power.   Enter Paulina carrying a baby, with Antigonus, lords and servants.  FIRST LORD. You must not enter.  PAULINA. Nay, rather, good my lords, be second to me: Fear you his tyrannous passion more, alas, Than the queen’s life? a gracious innocent soul, More free than he is jealous.  ANTIGONUS. That’s enough.  SERVANT. Madam, he hath not slept tonight; commanded None should come at him.  PAULINA. Not so hot, good sir; I come to bring him sleep. ’Tis such as you, That creep like shadows by him, and do sigh At each his needless heavings,—such as you Nourish the cause of his awaking. I Do come with words as med’cinal as true, Honest as either, to purge him of that humour That presses him from sleep.  LEONTES. What noise there, ho?  PAULINA. No noise, my lord; but needful conference About some gossips for your highness.  LEONTES. How! Away with that audacious lady! Antigonus, I charg’d thee that she should not come about me. I knew she would.  ANTIGONUS. I told her so, my lord, On your displeasure’s peril and on mine, She should not visit you.  LEONTES. What, canst not rule her?  PAULINA. From all dishonesty he can. In this, Unless he take the course that you have done, Commit me for committing honour—trust it, He shall not rule me.  ANTIGONUS. La you now, you hear. When she will take the rein I let her run; But she’ll not stumble.  PAULINA. Good my liege, I come,— And, I beseech you hear me, who professes Myself your loyal servant, your physician, Your most obedient counsellor, yet that dares Less appear so, in comforting your evils, Than such as most seem yours—I say I come From your good queen.  LEONTES. Good queen!  PAULINA. Good queen, my lord, good queen: I say, good queen, And would by combat make her good, so were I A man, the worst about you.  LEONTES. Force her hence.  PAULINA. Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes First hand me: on mine own accord I’ll off; But first I’ll do my errand. The good queen, (For she is good) hath brought you forth a daughter; Here ’tis; commends it to your blessing.   [_Laying down the child._]  LEONTES. Out! A mankind witch! Hence with her, out o’ door: A most intelligencing bawd!  PAULINA. Not so. I am as ignorant in that as you In so entitling me; and no less honest Than you are mad; which is enough, I’ll warrant, As this world goes, to pass for honest.  LEONTES. Traitors! Will you not push her out? [_To Antigonus._] Give her the bastard, Thou dotard! Thou art woman-tir’d, unroosted By thy Dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard, Take’t up, I say; give’t to thy crone.  PAULINA. For ever Unvenerable be thy hands, if thou Tak’st up the princess by that forced baseness Which he has put upon ’t!  LEONTES. He dreads his wife.  PAULINA. So I would you did; then ’twere past all doubt You’d call your children yours.  LEONTES. A nest of traitors!  ANTIGONUS. I am none, by this good light.  PAULINA. Nor I; nor any But one that’s here, and that’s himself. For he The sacred honour of himself, his queen’s, His hopeful son’s, his babe’s, betrays to slander, Whose sting is sharper than the sword’s; and will not, (For, as the case now stands, it is a curse He cannot be compell’d to’t) once remove The root of his opinion, which is rotten As ever oak or stone was sound.  LEONTES. A callat Of boundless tongue, who late hath beat her husband, And now baits me! This brat is none of mine; It is the issue of Polixenes. Hence with it, and together with the dam Commit them to the fire.  PAULINA. It is yours; And, might we lay th’ old proverb to your charge, So like you ’tis the worse. Behold, my lords, Although the print be little, the whole matter And copy of the father: eye, nose, lip, The trick of ’s frown, his forehead; nay, the valley, The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek; his smiles; The very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger: And thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it So like to him that got it, if thou hast The ordering of the mind too, ’mongst all colours No yellow in ’t, lest she suspect, as he does, Her children not her husband’s!  LEONTES. A gross hag! And, losel, thou art worthy to be hang’d That wilt not stay her tongue.  ANTIGONUS. Hang all the husbands That cannot do that feat, you’ll leave yourself Hardly one subject.  LEONTES. Once more, take her hence.  PAULINA. A most unworthy and unnatural lord Can do no more.  LEONTES. I’ll have thee burnt.  PAULINA. I care not. It is an heretic that makes the fire, Not she which burns in ’t. I’ll not call you tyrant; But this most cruel usage of your queen, Not able to produce more accusation Than your own weak-hing’d fancy, something savours Of tyranny, and will ignoble make you, Yea, scandalous to the world.  LEONTES. On your allegiance, Out of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant, Where were her life? She durst not call me so, If she did know me one. Away with her!  PAULINA. I pray you, do not push me; I’ll be gone. Look to your babe, my lord; ’tis yours: Jove send her A better guiding spirit! What needs these hands? You that are thus so tender o’er his follies, Will never do him good, not one of you. So, so. Farewell; we are gone.   [_Exit._]  LEONTES. Thou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this. My child? Away with’t. Even thou, that hast A heart so tender o’er it, take it hence, And see it instantly consum’d with fire; Even thou, and none but thou. Take it up straight: Within this hour bring me word ’tis done, And by good testimony, or I’ll seize thy life, With that thou else call’st thine. If thou refuse And wilt encounter with my wrath, say so; The bastard brains with these my proper hands Shall I dash out. Go, take it to the fire; For thou set’st on thy wife.  ANTIGONUS. I did not, sir: These lords, my noble fellows, if they please, Can clear me in ’t.  LORDS We can: my royal liege, He is not guilty of her coming hither.  LEONTES. You’re liars all.  FIRST LORD. Beseech your highness, give us better credit: We have always truly serv’d you; and beseech So to esteem of us. And on our knees we beg, As recompense of our dear services Past and to come, that you do change this purpose, Which being so horrible, so bloody, must Lead on to some foul issue. We all kneel.  LEONTES. I am a feather for each wind that blows. Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel And call me father? better burn it now Than curse it then. But be it; let it live. It shall not neither. [_To Antigonus._] You, sir, come you hither, You that have been so tenderly officious With Lady Margery, your midwife, there, To save this bastard’s life—for ’tis a bastard, So sure as this beard’s grey. What will you adventure To save this brat’s life?  ANTIGONUS. Anything, my lord, That my ability may undergo, And nobleness impose: at least thus much: I’ll pawn the little blood which I have left To save the innocent. Anything possible.  LEONTES. It shall be possible. Swear by this sword Thou wilt perform my bidding.  ANTIGONUS. I will, my lord.  LEONTES. Mark, and perform it, seest thou? for the fail Of any point in’t shall not only be Death to thyself, but to thy lewd-tongu’d wife, Whom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee, As thou art liegeman to us, that thou carry This female bastard hence, and that thou bear it To some remote and desert place, quite out Of our dominions; and that there thou leave it, Without more mercy, to it own protection And favour of the climate. As by strange fortune It came to us, I do in justice charge thee, On thy soul’s peril and thy body’s torture, That thou commend it strangely to some place Where chance may nurse or end it. Take it up.  ANTIGONUS. I swear to do this, though a present death Had been more merciful. Come on, poor babe: Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens To be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they say, Casting their savageness aside, have done Like offices of pity. Sir, be prosperous In more than this deed does require! And blessing Against this cruelty, fight on thy side, Poor thing, condemn’d to loss!   [_Exit with the child._]  LEONTES. No, I’ll not rear Another’s issue.   Enter a Servant.  SERVANT. Please your highness, posts From those you sent to th’ oracle are come An hour since: Cleomenes and Dion, Being well arriv’d from Delphos, are both landed, Hasting to th’ court.  FIRST LORD. So please you, sir, their speed Hath been beyond account.  LEONTES. Twenty-three days They have been absent: ’tis good speed; foretells The great Apollo suddenly will have The truth of this appear. Prepare you, lords; Summon a session, that we may arraign Our most disloyal lady; for, as she hath Been publicly accus’d, so shall she have A just and open trial. While she lives, My heart will be a burden to me. Leave me, And think upon my bidding.   [_Exeunt._]
 ACT IV  SCENE I.   Enter Time, the Chorus.  TIME. I that please some, try all: both joy and terror Of good and bad, that makes and unfolds error, Now take upon me, in the name of Time, To use my wings. Impute it not a crime To me or my swift passage, that I slide O’er sixteen years, and leave the growth untried Of that wide gap, since it is in my power To o’erthrow law, and in one self-born hour To plant and o’erwhelm custom. Let me pass The same I am, ere ancient’st order was Or what is now received. I witness to The times that brought them in; so shall I do To th’ freshest things now reigning, and make stale The glistering of this present, as my tale Now seems to it. Your patience this allowing, I turn my glass, and give my scene such growing As you had slept between. Leontes leaving Th’ effects of his fond jealousies, so grieving That he shuts up himself, imagine me, Gentle spectators, that I now may be In fair Bohemia, and remember well, I mentioned a son o’ th’ king’s, which Florizel I now name to you; and with speed so pace To speak of Perdita, now grown in grace Equal with wondering. What of her ensues I list not prophesy; but let Time’s news Be known when ’tis brought forth. A shepherd’s daughter, And what to her adheres, which follows after, Is th’ argument of Time. Of this allow, If ever you have spent time worse ere now; If never, yet that Time himself doth say He wishes earnestly you never may.   [_Exit._]  SCENE II. Bohemia. A Room in the palace of Polixenes.   Enter Polixenes and Camillo.  POLIXENES. I pray thee, good Camillo, be no more importunate: ’tis a sickness denying thee anything; a death to grant this.  CAMILLO. It is fifteen years since I saw my country. Though I have for the most part been aired abroad, I desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent king, my master, hath sent for me; to whose feeling sorrows I might be some allay, or I o’erween to think so,—which is another spur to my departure.  POLIXENES. As thou lov’st me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of thy services by leaving me now: the need I have of thee, thine own goodness hath made; better not to have had thee than thus to want thee. Thou, having made me businesses which none without thee can sufficiently manage, must either stay to execute them thyself, or take away with thee the very services thou hast done, which if I have not enough considered (as too much I cannot) to be more thankful to thee shall be my study; and my profit therein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal country Sicilia, prithee speak no more; whose very naming punishes me with the remembrance of that penitent, as thou call’st him, and reconciled king, my brother; whose loss of his most precious queen and children are even now to be afresh lamented. Say to me, when sawest thou the Prince Florizel, my son? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not being gracious, than they are in losing them when they have approved their virtues.  CAMILLO. Sir, it is three days since I saw the prince. What his happier affairs may be, are to me unknown, but I have missingly noted he is of late much retired from court, and is less frequent to his princely exercises than formerly he hath appeared.  POLIXENES. I have considered so much, Camillo, and with some care; so far that I have eyes under my service which look upon his removedness; from whom I have this intelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a most homely shepherd, a man, they say, that from very nothing, and beyond the imagination of his neighbours, is grown into an unspeakable estate.  CAMILLO. I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a daughter of most rare note: the report of her is extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage.  POLIXENES. That’s likewise part of my intelligence: but, I fear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou shalt accompany us to the place, where we will, not appearing what we are, have some question with the shepherd; from whose simplicity I think it not uneasy to get the cause of my son’s resort thither. Prithee, be my present partner in this business, and lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.  CAMILLO. I willingly obey your command.  POLIXENES. My best Camillo! We must disguise ourselves.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. The same. A Road near the Shepherd’s cottage.   Enter Autolycus, singing.  AUTOLYCUS. _When daffodils begin to peer,     With, hey! the doxy over the dale, Why, then comes in the sweet o’ the year,     For the red blood reigns in the winter’s pale._  _The white sheet bleaching on the hedge,     With, hey! the sweet birds, O, how they sing! Doth set my pugging tooth on edge;     For a quart of ale is a dish for a king._  _The lark, that tirra-lirra chants,     With, hey! with, hey! the thrush and the jay, Are summer songs for me and my aunts,     While we lie tumbling in the hay._  I have served Prince Florizel, and in my time wore three-pile, but now I am out of service.  _But shall I go mourn for that, my dear?     The pale moon shines by night: And when I wander here and there,     I then do most go right._  _If tinkers may have leave to live,     And bear the sow-skin budget, Then my account I well may give     And in the stocks avouch it._  My traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look to lesser linen. My father named me Autolycus; who being, I as am, littered under Mercury, was likewise a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die and drab I purchased this caparison, and my revenue is the silly cheat. Gallows and knock are too powerful on the highway. Beating and hanging are terrors to me. For the life to come, I sleep out the thought of it. A prize! a prize!   Enter Clown.  CLOWN. Let me see: every ’leven wether tods; every tod yields pound and odd shilling; fifteen hundred shorn, what comes the wool to?  AUTOLYCUS. [_Aside._] If the springe hold, the cock’s mine.  CLOWN. I cannot do’t without counters. Let me see; what am I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? “Three pound of sugar, five pound of currants, rice”—what will this sister of mine do with rice? But my father hath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays it on. She hath made me four-and-twenty nosegays for the shearers, three-man song-men all, and very good ones; but they are most of them means and basses, but one puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to hornpipes. I must have saffron to colour the warden pies; “mace; dates”, none, that’s out of my note; “nutmegs, seven; a race or two of ginger”, but that I may beg; “four pound of prunes, and as many of raisins o’ th’ sun.”  AUTOLYCUS. [_Grovelling on the ground._] O that ever I was born!  CLOWN. I’ th’ name of me!  AUTOLYCUS. O, help me, help me! Pluck but off these rags; and then, death, death!  CLOWN. Alack, poor soul! thou hast need of more rags to lay on thee, rather than have these off.  AUTOLYCUS. O sir, the loathsomeness of them offends me more than the stripes I have received, which are mighty ones and millions.  CLOWN. Alas, poor man! a million of beating may come to a great matter.  AUTOLYCUS. I am robbed, sir, and beaten; my money and apparel ta’en from me, and these detestable things put upon me.  CLOWN. What, by a horseman or a footman?  AUTOLYCUS. A footman, sweet sir, a footman.  CLOWN. Indeed, he should be a footman by the garments he has left with thee: if this be a horseman’s coat, it hath seen very hot service. Lend me thy hand, I’ll help thee: come, lend me thy hand.   [_Helping him up._]  AUTOLYCUS. O, good sir, tenderly, O!  CLOWN. Alas, poor soul!  AUTOLYCUS. O, good sir, softly, good sir. I fear, sir, my shoulder blade is out.  CLOWN. How now! canst stand?  AUTOLYCUS. Softly, dear sir! [_Picks his pocket._] good sir, softly. You ha’ done me a charitable office.  CLOWN. Dost lack any money? I have a little money for thee.  AUTOLYCUS. No, good sweet sir; no, I beseech you, sir: I have a kinsman not past three-quarters of a mile hence, unto whom I was going. I shall there have money or anything I want. Offer me no money, I pray you; that kills my heart.  CLOWN. What manner of fellow was he that robbed you?  AUTOLYCUS. A fellow, sir, that I have known to go about with troll-my-dames. I knew him once a servant of the prince; I cannot tell, good sir, for which of his virtues it was, but he was certainly whipped out of the court.  CLOWN. His vices, you would say; there’s no virtue whipped out of the court. They cherish it to make it stay there; and yet it will no more but abide.  AUTOLYCUS. Vices, I would say, sir. I know this man well. He hath been since an ape-bearer, then a process-server, a bailiff. Then he compassed a motion of the Prodigal Son, and married a tinker’s wife within a mile where my land and living lies; and, having flown over many knavish professions, he settled only in rogue. Some call him Autolycus.  CLOWN. Out upon him! prig, for my life, prig: he haunts wakes, fairs, and bear-baitings.  AUTOLYCUS. Very true, sir; he, sir, he; that’s the rogue that put me into this apparel.  CLOWN. Not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia. If you had but looked big and spit at him, he’d have run.  AUTOLYCUS. I must confess to you, sir, I am no fighter. I am false of heart that way; and that he knew, I warrant him.  CLOWN. How do you now?  AUTOLYCUS. Sweet sir, much better than I was. I can stand and walk: I will even take my leave of you and pace softly towards my kinsman’s.  CLOWN. Shall I bring thee on the way?  AUTOLYCUS. No, good-faced sir; no, sweet sir.  CLOWN. Then fare thee well. I must go buy spices for our sheep-shearing.  AUTOLYCUS. Prosper you, sweet sir!   [_Exit Clown._]   Your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice. I’ll be with you  at your sheep-shearing too. If I make not this cheat bring out  another, and the shearers prove sheep, let me be unrolled, and my name  put in the book of virtue! [_Sings._] _Jog on, jog on, the footpath way,     And merrily hent the stile-a: A merry heart goes all the day,     Your sad tires in a mile-a._   [_Exit._]  SCENE IV. The same. A Shepherd’s Cottage.   Enter Florizel and Perdita.  FLORIZEL. These your unusual weeds to each part of you Do give a life, no shepherdess, but Flora Peering in April’s front. This your sheep-shearing Is as a meeting of the petty gods, And you the queen on ’t.  PERDITA. Sir, my gracious lord, To chide at your extremes it not becomes me; O, pardon that I name them! Your high self, The gracious mark o’ th’ land, you have obscur’d With a swain’s wearing, and me, poor lowly maid, Most goddess-like prank’d up. But that our feasts In every mess have folly, and the feeders Digest it with a custom, I should blush To see you so attir’d; swoon, I think, To show myself a glass.  FLORIZEL. I bless the time When my good falcon made her flight across Thy father’s ground.  PERDITA. Now Jove afford you cause! To me the difference forges dread. Your greatness Hath not been us’d to fear. Even now I tremble To think your father, by some accident, Should pass this way, as you did. O, the Fates! How would he look to see his work, so noble, Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how Should I, in these my borrow’d flaunts, behold The sternness of his presence?  FLORIZEL. Apprehend Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves, Humbling their deities to love, have taken The shapes of beasts upon them. Jupiter Became a bull and bellow’d; the green Neptune A ram and bleated; and the fire-rob’d god, Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain, As I seem now. Their transformations Were never for a piece of beauty rarer, Nor in a way so chaste, since my desires Run not before mine honour, nor my lusts Burn hotter than my faith.  PERDITA. O, but, sir, Your resolution cannot hold when ’tis Oppos’d, as it must be, by the power of the king: One of these two must be necessities, Which then will speak, that you must change this purpose, Or I my life.  FLORIZEL. Thou dearest Perdita, With these forc’d thoughts, I prithee, darken not The mirth o’ th’ feast. Or I’ll be thine, my fair, Or not my father’s. For I cannot be Mine own, nor anything to any, if I be not thine. To this I am most constant, Though destiny say no. Be merry, gentle. Strangle such thoughts as these with anything That you behold the while. Your guests are coming: Lift up your countenance, as it were the day Of celebration of that nuptial which We two have sworn shall come.  PERDITA. O lady Fortune, Stand you auspicious!  FLORIZEL. See, your guests approach: Address yourself to entertain them sprightly, And let’s be red with mirth.   Enter Shepherd with Polixenes and Camillo, disguised; Clown, Mopsa,  Dorcas with others.  SHEPHERD. Fie, daughter! When my old wife liv’d, upon This day she was both pantler, butler, cook, Both dame and servant; welcom’d all; serv’d all; Would sing her song and dance her turn; now here At upper end o’ th’ table, now i’ th’ middle; On his shoulder, and his; her face o’ fire With labour, and the thing she took to quench it She would to each one sip. You are retired, As if you were a feasted one, and not The hostess of the meeting: pray you, bid These unknown friends to ’s welcome, for it is A way to make us better friends, more known. Come, quench your blushes, and present yourself That which you are, mistress o’ th’ feast. Come on, And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing, As your good flock shall prosper.  PERDITA. [_To Polixenes._] Sir, welcome. It is my father’s will I should take on me The hostess-ship o’ the day. [_To Camillo._] You’re welcome, sir. Give me those flowers there, Dorcas. Reverend sirs, For you there’s rosemary and rue; these keep Seeming and savour all the winter long. Grace and remembrance be to you both! And welcome to our shearing!  POLIXENES. Shepherdess— A fair one are you—well you fit our ages With flowers of winter.  PERDITA. Sir, the year growing ancient, Not yet on summer’s death nor on the birth Of trembling winter, the fairest flowers o’ th’ season Are our carnations and streak’d gillyvors, Which some call nature’s bastards: of that kind Our rustic garden’s barren; and I care not To get slips of them.  POLIXENES. Wherefore, gentle maiden, Do you neglect them?  PERDITA. For I have heard it said There is an art which, in their piedness, shares With great creating nature.  POLIXENES. Say there be; Yet nature is made better by no mean But nature makes that mean. So, over that art Which you say adds to nature, is an art That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry A gentler scion to the wildest stock, And make conceive a bark of baser kind By bud of nobler race. This is an art Which does mend nature, change it rather, but The art itself is nature.  PERDITA. So it is.  POLIXENES. Then make your garden rich in gillyvors, And do not call them bastards.  PERDITA. I’ll not put The dibble in earth to set one slip of them; No more than, were I painted, I would wish This youth should say ’twere well, and only therefore Desire to breed by me. Here’s flowers for you: Hot lavender, mints, savory, marjoram, The marigold, that goes to bed with th’ sun And with him rises weeping. These are flowers Of middle summer, and I think they are given To men of middle age. You’re very welcome.  CAMILLO. I should leave grazing, were I of your flock, And only live by gazing.  PERDITA. Out, alas! You’d be so lean that blasts of January Would blow you through and through. [_To Florizel_] Now, my fair’st friend, I would I had some flowers o’ th’ spring, that might Become your time of day; and yours, and yours, That wear upon your virgin branches yet Your maidenheads growing. O Proserpina, From the flowers now that, frighted, thou let’st fall From Dis’s waggon! daffodils, That come before the swallow dares, and take The winds of March with beauty; violets dim, But sweeter than the lids of Juno’s eyes Or Cytherea’s breath; pale primroses, That die unmarried ere they can behold Bright Phoebus in his strength (a malady Most incident to maids); bold oxlips and The crown imperial; lilies of all kinds, The flower-de-luce being one. O, these I lack, To make you garlands of; and my sweet friend, To strew him o’er and o’er!  FLORIZEL. What, like a corse?  PERDITA. No, like a bank for love to lie and play on; Not like a corse; or if, not to be buried, But quick, and in mine arms. Come, take your flowers. Methinks I play as I have seen them do In Whitsun pastorals. Sure this robe of mine Does change my disposition.  FLORIZEL. What you do Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet, I’d have you do it ever. When you sing, I’d have you buy and sell so, so give alms, Pray so; and, for the ord’ring your affairs, To sing them too. When you do dance, I wish you A wave o’ th’ sea, that you might ever do Nothing but that, move still, still so, And own no other function. Each your doing, So singular in each particular, Crowns what you are doing in the present deeds, That all your acts are queens.  PERDITA. O Doricles, Your praises are too large. But that your youth, And the true blood which peeps fairly through ’t, Do plainly give you out an unstained shepherd, With wisdom I might fear, my Doricles, You woo’d me the false way.  FLORIZEL. I think you have As little skill to fear as I have purpose To put you to ’t. But, come; our dance, I pray. Your hand, my Perdita. So turtles pair That never mean to part.  PERDITA. I’ll swear for ’em.  POLIXENES. This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever Ran on the green-sward. Nothing she does or seems But smacks of something greater than herself, Too noble for this place.  CAMILLO. He tells her something That makes her blood look out. Good sooth, she is The queen of curds and cream.  CLOWN. Come on, strike up.  DORCAS. Mopsa must be your mistress: marry, garlic, to mend her kissing with!  MOPSA. Now, in good time!  CLOWN. Not a word, a word; we stand upon our manners. Come, strike up.   [_Music. Here a dance Of Shepherds and Shepherdesses._]  POLIXENES. Pray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this Which dances with your daughter?  SHEPHERD. They call him Doricles; and boasts himself To have a worthy feeding. But I have it Upon his own report, and I believe it. He looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter. I think so too; for never gaz’d the moon Upon the water as he’ll stand and read, As ’twere, my daughter’s eyes. And, to be plain, I think there is not half a kiss to choose Who loves another best.  POLIXENES. She dances featly.  SHEPHERD. So she does anything, though I report it That should be silent. If young Doricles Do light upon her, she shall bring him that Which he not dreams of.   Enter a Servant.  SERVANT. O master, if you did but hear the pedlar at the door, you would never dance again after a tabor and pipe; no, the bagpipe could not move you. He sings several tunes faster than you’ll tell money. He utters them as he had eaten ballads, and all men’s ears grew to his tunes.  CLOWN. He could never come better: he shall come in. I love a ballad but even too well, if it be doleful matter merrily set down, or a very pleasant thing indeed and sung lamentably.  SERVANT. He hath songs for man or woman of all sizes. No milliner can so fit his customers with gloves. He has the prettiest love-songs for maids, so without bawdry, which is strange; with such delicate burdens of dildos and fadings, “jump her and thump her”; and where some stretch-mouthed rascal would, as it were, mean mischief and break a foul gap into the matter, he makes the maid to answer “Whoop, do me no harm, good man”; puts him off, slights him, with “Whoop, do me no harm, good man.”  POLIXENES. This is a brave fellow.  CLOWN. Believe me, thou talkest of an admirable conceited fellow. Has he any unbraided wares?  SERVANT. He hath ribbons of all the colours i’ th’ rainbow; points, more than all the lawyers in Bohemia can learnedly handle, though they come to him by th’ gross; inkles, caddisses, cambrics, lawns; why he sings ’em over as they were gods or goddesses; you would think a smock were a she-angel, he so chants to the sleeve-hand and the work about the square on ’t.  CLOWN. Prithee bring him in; and let him approach singing.  PERDITA. Forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in ’s tunes.   [_Exit Servant._]  CLOWN. You have of these pedlars that have more in them than you’d think, sister.  PERDITA. Ay, good brother, or go about to think.   Enter Autolycus, singing.  AUTOLYCUS. _Lawn as white as driven snow, Cypress black as e’er was crow, Gloves as sweet as damask roses, Masks for faces and for noses, Bugle-bracelet, necklace amber, Perfume for a lady’s chamber, Golden quoifs and stomachers For my lads to give their dears, Pins and poking-sticks of steel, What maids lack from head to heel. Come buy of me, come; come buy, come buy; Buy, lads, or else your lasses cry. Come, buy._  CLOWN. If I were not in love with Mopsa, thou shouldst take no money of me; but being enthralled as I am, it will also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves.  MOPSA. I was promised them against the feast; but they come not too late now.  DORCAS. He hath promised you more than that, or there be liars.  MOPSA. He hath paid you all he promised you. Maybe he has paid you more, which will shame you to give him again.  CLOWN. Is there no manners left among maids? Will they wear their plackets where they should bear their faces? Is there not milking-time, when you are going to bed, or kiln-hole, to whistle of these secrets, but you must be tittle-tattling before all our guests? ’Tis well they are whispering. Clamour your tongues, and not a word more.  MOPSA. I have done. Come, you promised me a tawdry lace and a pair of sweet gloves.  CLOWN. Have I not told thee how I was cozened by the way and lost all my money?  AUTOLYCUS. And indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad; therefore it behoves men to be wary.  CLOWN. Fear not thou, man. Thou shalt lose nothing here.  AUTOLYCUS. I hope so, sir; for I have about me many parcels of charge.  CLOWN. What hast here? Ballads?  MOPSA. Pray now, buy some. I love a ballad in print alife, for then we are sure they are true.  AUTOLYCUS. Here’s one to a very doleful tune. How a usurer’s wife was brought to bed of twenty money-bags at a burden, and how she longed to eat adders’ heads and toads carbonadoed.  MOPSA. Is it true, think you?  AUTOLYCUS. Very true, and but a month old.  DORCAS. Bless me from marrying a usurer!  AUTOLYCUS. Here’s the midwife’s name to’t, one Mistress Taleporter, and five or six honest wives that were present. Why should I carry lies abroad?  MOPSA. Pray you now, buy it.  CLOWN. Come on, lay it by; and let’s first see more ballads. We’ll buy the other things anon.  AUTOLYCUS. Here’s another ballad, of a fish that appeared upon the coast on Wednesday the fourscore of April, forty thousand fathom above water, and sung this ballad against the hard hearts of maids. It was thought she was a woman, and was turned into a cold fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that loved her. The ballad is very pitiful, and as true.  DORCAS. Is it true too, think you?  AUTOLYCUS. Five justices’ hands at it, and witnesses more than my pack will hold.  CLOWN. Lay it by too: another.  AUTOLYCUS. This is a merry ballad; but a very pretty one.  MOPSA. Let’s have some merry ones.  AUTOLYCUS. Why, this is a passing merry one and goes to the tune of “Two maids wooing a man.” There’s scarce a maid westward but she sings it. ’Tis in request, I can tell you.  MOPSA. We can both sing it: if thou’lt bear a part, thou shalt hear; ’tis in three parts.  DORCAS. We had the tune on ’t a month ago.  AUTOLYCUS. I can bear my part; you must know ’tis my occupation: have at it with you.  SONG.  AUTOLYCUS. _Get you hence, for I must go Where it fits not you to know._  DORCAS. _Whither?_  MOPSA. _O, whither?_  DORCAS. _Whither?_  MOPSA. _It becomes thy oath full well Thou to me thy secrets tell._  DORCAS. _Me too! Let me go thither._  MOPSA. Or thou goest to th’ grange or mill.  DORCAS. _If to either, thou dost ill._  AUTOLYCUS. _Neither._  DORCAS. _What, neither?_  AUTOLYCUS. _Neither._  DORCAS. _Thou hast sworn my love to be._  MOPSA. _Thou hast sworn it more to me. Then whither goest? Say, whither?_  CLOWN. We’ll have this song out anon by ourselves. My father and the gentlemen are in sad talk, and we’ll not trouble them. Come, bring away thy pack after me. Wenches, I’ll buy for you both. Pedlar, let’s have the first choice. Follow me, girls.   [_Exit with Dorcas and Mopsa._]  AUTOLYCUS. [_Aside._] And you shall pay well for ’em.  SONG.
    _Will you buy any tape,     Or lace for your cape, My dainty duck, my dear-a?     Any silk, any thread,     Any toys for your head, Of the new’st and fin’st, fin’st wear-a?     Come to the pedlar;     Money’s a meddler That doth utter all men’s ware-a._   [_Exit._]   Enter Servant.  SERVANT. Master, there is three carters, three shepherds, three neat-herds, three swine-herds, that have made themselves all men of hair. They call themselves saltiers, and they have dance which the wenches say is a gallimaufry of gambols, because they are not in ’t; but they themselves are o’ the mind (if it be not too rough for some that know little but bowling) it will please plentifully.  SHEPHERD. Away! we’ll none on ’t. Here has been too much homely foolery already. I know, sir, we weary you.  POLIXENES. You weary those that refresh us: pray, let’s see these four threes of herdsmen.  SERVANT. One three of them, by their own report, sir, hath danced before the king; and not the worst of the three but jumps twelve foot and a half by th’ square.  SHEPHERD. Leave your prating: since these good men are pleased, let them come in; but quickly now.  SERVANT. Why, they stay at door, sir.   [_Exit._]   Enter Twelve Rustics, habited like Satyrs. They dance, and then  exeunt.  POLIXENES. O, father, you’ll know more of that hereafter. [_To Camillo._] Is it not too far gone? ’Tis time to part them. He’s simple and tells much. [_To Florizel._] How now, fair shepherd! Your heart is full of something that does take Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young And handed love, as you do, I was wont To load my she with knacks: I would have ransack’d The pedlar’s silken treasury and have pour’d it To her acceptance. You have let him go, And nothing marted with him. If your lass Interpretation should abuse, and call this Your lack of love or bounty, you were straited For a reply, at least if you make a care Of happy holding her.  FLORIZEL. Old sir, I know She prizes not such trifles as these are: The gifts she looks from me are pack’d and lock’d Up in my heart, which I have given already, But not deliver’d. O, hear me breathe my life Before this ancient sir, who, it should seem, Hath sometime lov’d. I take thy hand! this hand, As soft as dove’s down and as white as it, Or Ethiopian’s tooth, or the fann’d snow that’s bolted By th’ northern blasts twice o’er.  POLIXENES. What follows this? How prettily the young swain seems to wash The hand was fair before! I have put you out. But to your protestation. Let me hear What you profess.  FLORIZEL. Do, and be witness to ’t.  POLIXENES. And this my neighbour, too?  FLORIZEL. And he, and more Than he, and men, the earth, the heavens, and all: That were I crown’d the most imperial monarch, Thereof most worthy, were I the fairest youth That ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge More than was ever man’s, I would not prize them Without her love; for her employ them all; Commend them and condemn them to her service, Or to their own perdition.  POLIXENES. Fairly offer’d.  CAMILLO. This shows a sound affection.  SHEPHERD. But my daughter, Say you the like to him?  PERDITA. I cannot speak So well, nothing so well; no, nor mean better: By th’ pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out The purity of his.  SHEPHERD. Take hands, a bargain! And, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to’t. I give my daughter to him, and will make Her portion equal his.  FLORIZEL. O, that must be I’ th’ virtue of your daughter: one being dead, I shall have more than you can dream of yet; Enough then for your wonder. But come on, Contract us ’fore these witnesses.  SHEPHERD. Come, your hand; And, daughter, yours.  POLIXENES. Soft, swain, awhile, beseech you; Have you a father?  FLORIZEL. I have; but what of him?  POLIXENES. Knows he of this?  FLORIZEL. He neither does nor shall.  POLIXENES. Methinks a father Is at the nuptial of his son a guest That best becomes the table. Pray you once more, Is not your father grown incapable Of reasonable affairs? is he not stupid With age and alt’ring rheums? can he speak? hear? Know man from man? dispute his own estate? Lies he not bed-rid? and again does nothing But what he did being childish?  FLORIZEL. No, good sir; He has his health, and ampler strength indeed Than most have of his age.  POLIXENES. By my white beard, You offer him, if this be so, a wrong Something unfilial: reason my son Should choose himself a wife, but as good reason The father, all whose joy is nothing else But fair posterity, should hold some counsel In such a business.  FLORIZEL. I yield all this; But for some other reasons, my grave sir, Which ’tis not fit you know, I not acquaint My father of this business.  POLIXENES. Let him know ’t.  FLORIZEL. He shall not.  POLIXENES. Prithee let him.  FLORIZEL. No, he must not.  SHEPHERD. Let him, my son: he shall not need to grieve At knowing of thy choice.  FLORIZEL. Come, come, he must not. Mark our contract.  POLIXENES. [_Discovering himself._] Mark your divorce, young sir, Whom son I dare not call; thou art too base To be acknowledged: thou a sceptre’s heir, That thus affects a sheep-hook! Thou, old traitor, I am sorry that, by hanging thee, I can But shorten thy life one week. And thou, fresh piece Of excellent witchcraft, whom of force must know The royal fool thou cop’st with,—  SHEPHERD. O, my heart!  POLIXENES. I’ll have thy beauty scratch’d with briers and made More homely than thy state. For thee, fond boy, If I may ever know thou dost but sigh That thou no more shalt see this knack (as never I mean thou shalt), we’ll bar thee from succession; Not hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin, Far than Deucalion off. Mark thou my words. Follow us to the court. Thou churl, for this time, Though full of our displeasure, yet we free thee From the dead blow of it. And you, enchantment, Worthy enough a herdsman; yea, him too That makes himself, but for our honour therein, Unworthy thee. If ever henceforth thou These rural latches to his entrance open, Or hoop his body more with thy embraces, I will devise a death as cruel for thee As thou art tender to ’t.   [_Exit._]  PERDITA. Even here undone. I was not much afeard, for once or twice I was about to speak, and tell him plainly The selfsame sun that shines upon his court Hides not his visage from our cottage, but Looks on alike. [_To Florizel._] Will’t please you, sir, be gone? I told you what would come of this. Beseech you, Of your own state take care. This dream of mine— Being now awake, I’ll queen it no inch farther, But milk my ewes, and weep.  CAMILLO. Why, how now, father! Speak ere thou diest.  SHEPHERD. I cannot speak, nor think, Nor dare to know that which I know. O sir, You have undone a man of fourscore three, That thought to fill his grave in quiet; yea, To die upon the bed my father died, To lie close by his honest bones; but now Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me Where no priest shovels in dust. O cursed wretch, That knew’st this was the prince, and wouldst adventure To mingle faith with him! Undone, undone! If I might die within this hour, I have liv’d To die when I desire.   [_Exit._]  FLORIZEL. Why look you so upon me? I am but sorry, not afeard; delay’d, But nothing alt’red: what I was, I am: More straining on for plucking back; not following My leash unwillingly.  CAMILLO. Gracious my lord, You know your father’s temper: at this time He will allow no speech (which I do guess You do not purpose to him) and as hardly Will he endure your sight as yet, I fear: Then, till the fury of his highness settle, Come not before him.  FLORIZEL. I not purpose it. I think Camillo?  CAMILLO. Even he, my lord.  PERDITA. How often have I told you ’twould be thus! How often said my dignity would last But till ’twere known!  FLORIZEL. It cannot fail but by The violation of my faith; and then Let nature crush the sides o’ th’ earth together And mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks. From my succession wipe me, father; I Am heir to my affection.  CAMILLO. Be advis’d.  FLORIZEL. I am, and by my fancy. If my reason Will thereto be obedient, I have reason; If not, my senses, better pleas’d with madness, Do bid it welcome.  CAMILLO. This is desperate, sir.  FLORIZEL. So call it: but it does fulfil my vow. I needs must think it honesty. Camillo, Not for Bohemia, nor the pomp that may Be thereat glean’d; for all the sun sees or The close earth wombs, or the profound seas hides In unknown fathoms, will I break my oath To this my fair belov’d. Therefore, I pray you, As you have ever been my father’s honour’d friend, When he shall miss me,—as, in faith, I mean not To see him any more,—cast your good counsels Upon his passion: let myself and fortune Tug for the time to come. This you may know, And so deliver, I am put to sea With her whom here I cannot hold on shore; And, most opportune to her need, I have A vessel rides fast by, but not prepar’d For this design. What course I mean to hold Shall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor Concern me the reporting.  CAMILLO. O my lord, I would your spirit were easier for advice, Or stronger for your need.  FLORIZEL. Hark, Perdita. [_Takes her aside._] [_To Camillo._] I’ll hear you by and by.  CAMILLO. He’s irremovable, Resolv’d for flight. Now were I happy if His going I could frame to serve my turn, Save him from danger, do him love and honour, Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia And that unhappy king, my master, whom I so much thirst to see.  FLORIZEL. Now, good Camillo, I am so fraught with curious business that I leave out ceremony.  CAMILLO. Sir, I think You have heard of my poor services, i’ th’ love That I have borne your father?  FLORIZEL. Very nobly Have you deserv’d: it is my father’s music To speak your deeds, not little of his care To have them recompens’d as thought on.  CAMILLO. Well, my lord, If you may please to think I love the king, And, through him, what’s nearest to him, which is Your gracious self, embrace but my direction, If your more ponderous and settled project May suffer alteration. On mine honour, I’ll point you where you shall have such receiving As shall become your highness; where you may Enjoy your mistress; from the whom, I see, There’s no disjunction to be made, but by, As heavens forfend, your ruin. Marry her, And with my best endeavours in your absence Your discontenting father strive to qualify And bring him up to liking.  FLORIZEL. How, Camillo, May this, almost a miracle, be done? That I may call thee something more than man, And after that trust to thee.  CAMILLO. Have you thought on A place whereto you’ll go?  FLORIZEL. Not any yet. But as th’ unthought-on accident is guilty To what we wildly do, so we profess Ourselves to be the slaves of chance, and flies Of every wind that blows.  CAMILLO. Then list to me: This follows, if you will not change your purpose, But undergo this flight, make for Sicilia, And there present yourself and your fair princess, For so, I see, she must be, ’fore Leontes: She shall be habited as it becomes The partner of your bed. Methinks I see Leontes opening his free arms and weeping His welcomes forth; asks thee, the son, forgiveness, As ’twere i’ th’ father’s person; kisses the hands Of your fresh princess; o’er and o’er divides him ’Twixt his unkindness and his kindness. Th’ one He chides to hell, and bids the other grow Faster than thought or time.  FLORIZEL. Worthy Camillo, What colour for my visitation shall I Hold up before him?  CAMILLO. Sent by the king your father To greet him and to give him comforts. Sir, The manner of your bearing towards him, with What you (as from your father) shall deliver, Things known betwixt us three, I’ll write you down, The which shall point you forth at every sitting What you must say; that he shall not perceive But that you have your father’s bosom there And speak his very heart.  FLORIZEL. I am bound to you: There is some sap in this.  CAMILLO. A course more promising Than a wild dedication of yourselves To unpath’d waters, undream’d shores, most certain To miseries enough: no hope to help you, But as you shake off one to take another: Nothing so certain as your anchors, who Do their best office if they can but stay you Where you’ll be loath to be. Besides, you know Prosperity’s the very bond of love, Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together Affliction alters.  PERDITA. One of these is true: I think affliction may subdue the cheek, But not take in the mind.  CAMILLO. Yea, say you so? There shall not at your father’s house, these seven years Be born another such.  FLORIZEL. My good Camillo, She is as forward of her breeding as She is i’ th’ rear our birth.  CAMILLO. I cannot say ’tis pity She lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress To most that teach.  PERDITA. Your pardon, sir; for this I’ll blush you thanks.  FLORIZEL. My prettiest Perdita! But, O, the thorns we stand upon! Camillo, Preserver of my father, now of me, The medicine of our house, how shall we do? We are not furnish’d like Bohemia’s son, Nor shall appear in Sicilia.  CAMILLO. My lord, Fear none of this. I think you know my fortunes Do all lie there: it shall be so my care To have you royally appointed as if The scene you play were mine. For instance, sir, That you may know you shall not want,—one word. [_They talk aside._]   Enter Autolycus.  AUTOLYCUS. Ha, ha! what a fool Honesty is! and Trust, his sworn brother, a very simple gentleman! I have sold all my trumpery. Not a counterfeit stone, not a ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad, knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring, to keep my pack from fasting. They throng who should buy first, as if my trinkets had been hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer: by which means I saw whose purse was best in picture; and what I saw, to my good use I remembered. My clown (who wants but something to be a reasonable man) grew so in love with the wenches’ song that he would not stir his pettitoes till he had both tune and words; which so drew the rest of the herd to me that all their other senses stuck in ears: you might have pinched a placket, it was senseless; ’twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a purse; I would have filed keys off that hung in chains: no hearing, no feeling, but my sir’s song, and admiring the nothing of it. So that in this time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their festival purses; and had not the old man come in with a whoobub against his daughter and the king’s son, and scared my choughs from the chaff, I had not left a purse alive in the whole army.   Camillo, Florizel and Perdita come forward.  CAMILLO. Nay, but my letters, by this means being there So soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt.  FLORIZEL. And those that you’ll procure from king Leontes?  CAMILLO. Shall satisfy your father.  PERDITA. Happy be you! All that you speak shows fair.  CAMILLO. [_Seeing Autolycus._] Who have we here? We’ll make an instrument of this; omit Nothing may give us aid.  AUTOLYCUS. [_Aside._] If they have overheard me now,—why, hanging.  CAMILLO. How now, good fellow! why shakest thou so? Fear not, man; here’s no harm intended to thee.  AUTOLYCUS. I am a poor fellow, sir.  CAMILLO. Why, be so still; here’s nobody will steal that from thee: yet, for the outside of thy poverty we must make an exchange; therefore discase thee instantly,—thou must think there’s a necessity in’t—and change garments with this gentleman: though the pennyworth on his side be the worst, yet hold thee, there’s some boot.   [_Giving money._]  AUTOLYCUS. I am a poor fellow, sir: [_Aside._] I know ye well enough.  CAMILLO. Nay, prithee dispatch: the gentleman is half flayed already.  AUTOLYCUS. Are you in earnest, sir? [_Aside._] I smell the trick on’t.  FLORIZEL. Dispatch, I prithee.  AUTOLYCUS. Indeed, I have had earnest; but I cannot with conscience take it.  CAMILLO. Unbuckle, unbuckle.   [_Florizel and Autolycus exchange garments._]  Fortunate mistress,—let my prophecy Come home to you!—you must retire yourself Into some covert. Take your sweetheart’s hat And pluck it o’er your brows, muffle your face, Dismantle you; and, as you can, disliken The truth of your own seeming; that you may (For I do fear eyes over) to shipboard Get undescried.  PERDITA. I see the play so lies That I must bear a part.  CAMILLO. No remedy. Have you done there?  FLORIZEL. Should I now meet my father, He would not call me son.  CAMILLO. Nay, you shall have no hat. [_Giving it to Perdita._] Come, lady, come. Farewell, my friend.  AUTOLYCUS. Adieu, sir.  FLORIZEL. O Perdita, what have we twain forgot? Pray you a word.   [_They converse apart._]  CAMILLO. [_Aside._] What I do next, shall be to tell the king Of this escape, and whither they are bound; Wherein my hope is I shall so prevail To force him after: in whose company I shall re-view Sicilia; for whose sight I have a woman’s longing.  FLORIZEL. Fortune speed us! Thus we set on, Camillo, to the sea-side.  CAMILLO. The swifter speed the better.   [_Exeunt Florizel, Perdita and Camillo._]  AUTOLYCUS. I understand the business, I hear it. To have an open ear, a quick eye, and a nimble hand, is necessary for a cut-purse; a good nose is requisite also, to smell out work for the other senses. I see this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive. What an exchange had this been without boot! What a boot is here with this exchange! Sure the gods do this year connive at us, and we may do anything extempore. The prince himself is about a piece of iniquity, stealing away from his father with his clog at his heels: if I thought it were a piece of honesty to acquaint the king withal, I would not do’t: I hold it the more knavery to conceal it; and therein am I constant to my profession.   Enter Clown and Shepherd.  Aside, aside; here is more matter for a hot brain: every lane’s end, every shop, church, session, hanging, yields a careful man work.  CLOWN. See, see; what a man you are now! There is no other way but to tell the king she’s a changeling, and none of your flesh and blood.  SHEPHERD. Nay, but hear me.  CLOWN. Nay, but hear me.  SHEPHERD. Go to, then.  CLOWN. She being none of your flesh and blood, your flesh and blood has not offended the king; and so your flesh and blood is not to be punished by him. Show those things you found about her, those secret things, all but what she has with her: this being done, let the law go whistle, I warrant you.  SHEPHERD. I will tell the king all, every word, yea, and his son’s pranks too; who, I may say, is no honest man neither to his father nor to me, to go about to make me the king’s brother-in-law.  CLOWN. Indeed, brother-in-law was the farthest off you could have been to him, and then your blood had been the dearer by I know how much an ounce.  AUTOLYCUS. [_Aside._] Very wisely, puppies!  SHEPHERD. Well, let us to the king: there is that in this fardel will make him scratch his beard.  AUTOLYCUS. [_Aside._] I know not what impediment this complaint may be to the flight of my master.  CLOWN. Pray heartily he be at’ palace.  AUTOLYCUS. [_Aside._] Though I am not naturally honest, I am so sometimes by chance. Let me pocket up my pedlar’s excrement. [_Takes off his false beard._] How now, rustics! whither are you bound?  SHEPHERD. To the palace, an it like your worship.  AUTOLYCUS. Your affairs there, what, with whom, the condition of that fardel, the place of your dwelling, your names, your ages, of what having, breeding, and anything that is fitting to be known? discover!  CLOWN. We are but plain fellows, sir.  AUTOLYCUS. A lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have no lying. It becomes none but tradesmen, and they often give us soldiers the lie; but we pay them for it with stamped coin, not stabbing steel; therefore they do not give us the lie.  CLOWN. Your worship had like to have given us one, if you had not taken yourself with the manner.  SHEPHERD. Are you a courtier, an ’t like you, sir?  AUTOLYCUS. Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seest thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings? hath not my gait in it the measure of the court? receives not thy nose court-odour from me? reflect I not on thy baseness court-contempt? Think’st thou, for that I insinuate, or toaze from thee thy business, I am therefore no courtier? I am courtier _cap-a-pe_, and one that will either push on or pluck back thy business there. Whereupon I command thee to open thy affair.  SHEPHERD. My business, sir, is to the king.  AUTOLYCUS. What advocate hast thou to him?  SHEPHERD. I know not, an ’t like you.  CLOWN. Advocate’s the court-word for a pheasant. Say you have none.  SHEPHERD. None, sir; I have no pheasant, cock nor hen.  AUTOLYCUS. How bless’d are we that are not simple men! Yet nature might have made me as these are, Therefore I will not disdain.  CLOWN. This cannot be but a great courtier.  SHEPHERD. His garments are rich, but he wears them not handsomely.  CLOWN. He seems to be the more noble in being fantastical: a great man, I’ll warrant; I know by the picking on’s teeth.  AUTOLYCUS. The fardel there? What’s i’ th’ fardel? Wherefore that box?  SHEPHERD. Sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box which none must know but the king; and which he shall know within this hour, if I may come to th’ speech of him.  AUTOLYCUS. Age, thou hast lost thy labour.  SHEPHERD. Why, sir?  AUTOLYCUS. The king is not at the palace; he is gone aboard a new ship to purge melancholy and air himself: for, if thou beest capable of things serious, thou must know the king is full of grief.  SHEPHERD. So ’tis said, sir; about his son, that should have married a shepherd’s daughter.  AUTOLYCUS. If that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly. The curses he shall have, the tortures he shall feel, will break the back of man, the heart of monster.  CLOWN. Think you so, sir?  AUTOLYCUS. Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy and vengeance bitter; but those that are germane to him, though removed fifty times, shall all come under the hangman: which, though it be great pity, yet it is necessary. An old sheep-whistling rogue, a ram-tender, to offer to have his daughter come into grace! Some say he shall be stoned; but that death is too soft for him, say I. Draw our throne into a sheepcote! All deaths are too few, the sharpest too easy.  CLOWN. Has the old man e’er a son, sir, do you hear, an ’t like you, sir?  AUTOLYCUS. He has a son, who shall be flayed alive; then ’nointed over with honey, set on the head of a wasp’s nest; then stand till he be three quarters and a dram dead; then recovered again with aqua-vitæ or some other hot infusion; then, raw as he is, and in the hottest day prognostication proclaims, shall he be set against a brick wall, the sun looking with a southward eye upon him, where he is to behold him with flies blown to death. But what talk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries are to be smiled at, their offences being so capital? Tell me (for you seem to be honest plain men) what you have to the king. Being something gently considered, I’ll bring you where he is aboard, tender your persons to his presence, whisper him in your behalfs; and if it be in man besides the king to effect your suits, here is man shall do it.  CLOWN. He seems to be of great authority: close with him, give him gold; and though authority be a stubborn bear, yet he is oft led by the nose with gold: show the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand, and no more ado. Remember: “ston’d” and “flayed alive”.  SHEPHERD. An ’t please you, sir, to undertake the business for us, here is that gold I have. I’ll make it as much more, and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you.  AUTOLYCUS. After I have done what I promised?  SHEPHERD. Ay, sir.  AUTOLYCUS. Well, give me the moiety. Are you a party in this business?  CLOWN. In some sort, sir: but though my case be a pitiful one, I hope I shall not be flayed out of it.  AUTOLYCUS. O, that’s the case of the shepherd’s son. Hang him, he’ll be made an example.  CLOWN. Comfort, good comfort! We must to the king and show our strange sights. He must know ’tis none of your daughter nor my sister; we are gone else. Sir, I will give you as much as this old man does when the business is performed, and remain, as he says, your pawn till it be brought you.  AUTOLYCUS. I will trust you. Walk before toward the sea-side; go on the right-hand. I will but look upon the hedge, and follow you.  CLOWN. We are blessed in this man, as I may say, even blessed.  SHEPHERD. Let’s before, as he bids us. He was provided to do us good.   [_Exeunt Shepherd and Clown._]  AUTOLYCUS. If I had a mind to be honest, I see Fortune would not suffer me: she drops booties in my mouth. I am courted now with a double occasion: gold, and a means to do the prince my master good; which who knows how that may turn back to my advancement? I will bring these two moles, these blind ones, aboard him. If he think it fit to shore them again and that the complaint they have to the king concerns him nothing, let him call me rogue for being so far officious; for I am proof against that title and what shame else belongs to ’t. To him will I present them. There may be matter in it.   [_Exit._]
 ACT V  SCENE I. Sicilia. A Room in the palace of Leontes.   Enter Leontes, Cleomenes, Dion, Paulina and others.  CLEOMENES Sir, you have done enough, and have perform’d A saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make Which you have not redeem’d; indeed, paid down More penitence than done trespass: at the last, Do as the heavens have done, forget your evil; With them, forgive yourself.  LEONTES. Whilst I remember Her and her virtues, I cannot forget My blemishes in them; and so still think of The wrong I did myself: which was so much That heirless it hath made my kingdom, and Destroy’d the sweet’st companion that e’er man Bred his hopes out of.  PAULINA. True, too true, my lord. If, one by one, you wedded all the world, Or from the all that are took something good, To make a perfect woman, she you kill’d Would be unparallel’d.  LEONTES. I think so. Kill’d! She I kill’d! I did so: but thou strik’st me Sorely, to say I did: it is as bitter Upon thy tongue as in my thought. Now, good now, Say so but seldom.  CLEOMENES Not at all, good lady. You might have spoken a thousand things that would Have done the time more benefit and grac’d Your kindness better.  PAULINA. You are one of those Would have him wed again.  DION. If you would not so, You pity not the state, nor the remembrance Of his most sovereign name; consider little What dangers, by his highness’ fail of issue, May drop upon his kingdom, and devour Incertain lookers-on. What were more holy Than to rejoice the former queen is well? What holier than, for royalty’s repair, For present comfort, and for future good, To bless the bed of majesty again With a sweet fellow to ’t?  PAULINA. There is none worthy, Respecting her that’s gone. Besides, the gods Will have fulfill’d their secret purposes; For has not the divine Apollo said, Is ’t not the tenor of his oracle, That king Leontes shall not have an heir Till his lost child be found? Which that it shall, Is all as monstrous to our human reason As my Antigonus to break his grave And come again to me; who, on my life, Did perish with the infant. ’Tis your counsel My lord should to the heavens be contrary, Oppose against their wills. [_To Leontes._] Care not for issue; The crown will find an heir. Great Alexander Left his to th’ worthiest; so his successor Was like to be the best.  LEONTES. Good Paulina, Who hast the memory of Hermione, I know, in honour, O that ever I Had squar’d me to thy counsel! Then, even now, I might have look’d upon my queen’s full eyes, Have taken treasure from her lips,—  PAULINA. And left them More rich for what they yielded.  LEONTES. Thou speak’st truth. No more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse, And better us’d, would make her sainted spirit Again possess her corpse, and on this stage, (Where we offenders now appear) soul-vexed, And begin “Why to me?”  PAULINA. Had she such power, She had just cause.  LEONTES. She had; and would incense me To murder her I married.  PAULINA. I should so. Were I the ghost that walk’d, I’d bid you mark Her eye, and tell me for what dull part in ’t You chose her: then I’d shriek, that even your ears Should rift to hear me; and the words that follow’d Should be “Remember mine.”  LEONTES. Stars, stars, And all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife; I’ll have no wife, Paulina.  PAULINA. Will you swear Never to marry but by my free leave?  LEONTES. Never, Paulina; so be bless’d my spirit!  PAULINA. Then, good my lords, bear witness to his oath.  CLEOMENES You tempt him over-much.  PAULINA. Unless another, As like Hermione as is her picture, Affront his eye.  CLEOMENES Good madam,—  PAULINA. I have done. Yet, if my lord will marry,—if you will, sir, No remedy but you will,—give me the office To choose you a queen: she shall not be so young As was your former, but she shall be such As, walk’d your first queen’s ghost, it should take joy To see her in your arms.  LEONTES. My true Paulina, We shall not marry till thou bid’st us.  PAULINA. That Shall be when your first queen’s again in breath; Never till then.   Enter a Servant.  SERVANT. One that gives out himself Prince Florizel, Son of Polixenes, with his princess (she The fairest I have yet beheld) desires access To your high presence.  LEONTES. What with him? he comes not Like to his father’s greatness: his approach, So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us ’Tis not a visitation fram’d, but forc’d By need and accident. What train?  SERVANT. But few, And those but mean.  LEONTES. His princess, say you, with him?  SERVANT. Ay, the most peerless piece of earth, I think, That e’er the sun shone bright on.  PAULINA. O Hermione, As every present time doth boast itself Above a better gone, so must thy grave Give way to what’s seen now! Sir, you yourself Have said and writ so,—but your writing now Is colder than that theme,—‘She had not been, Nor was not to be equall’d’; thus your verse Flow’d with her beauty once; ’tis shrewdly ebb’d, To say you have seen a better.  SERVANT. Pardon, madam: The one I have almost forgot,—your pardon;— The other, when she has obtain’d your eye, Will have your tongue too. This is a creature, Would she begin a sect, might quench the zeal Of all professors else; make proselytes Of who she but bid follow.  PAULINA. How! not women?  SERVANT. Women will love her that she is a woman More worth than any man; men, that she is The rarest of all women.  LEONTES. Go, Cleomenes; Yourself, assisted with your honour’d friends, Bring them to our embracement.   [_Exeunt Cleomenes and others._]  Still, ’tis strange He thus should steal upon us.  PAULINA. Had our prince, Jewel of children, seen this hour, he had pair’d Well with this lord. There was not full a month Between their births.  LEONTES. Prithee no more; cease; Thou know’st He dies to me again when talk’d of: sure, When I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches Will bring me to consider that which may Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.   Enter Florizel, Perdita, Cleomenes and others.  Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince; For she did print your royal father off, Conceiving you. Were I but twenty-one, Your father’s image is so hit in you, His very air, that I should call you brother, As I did him, and speak of something wildly By us perform’d before. Most dearly welcome! And your fair princess,—goddess! O, alas! I lost a couple that ’twixt heaven and earth Might thus have stood, begetting wonder, as You, gracious couple, do! And then I lost,— All mine own folly,—the society, Amity too, of your brave father, whom, Though bearing misery, I desire my life Once more to look on him.  FLORIZEL. By his command Have I here touch’d Sicilia, and from him Give you all greetings that a king, at friend, Can send his brother: and, but infirmity, Which waits upon worn times, hath something seiz’d His wish’d ability, he had himself The lands and waters ’twixt your throne and his Measur’d, to look upon you; whom he loves, He bade me say so,—more than all the sceptres And those that bear them living.  LEONTES. O my brother,— Good gentleman!—the wrongs I have done thee stir Afresh within me; and these thy offices, So rarely kind, are as interpreters Of my behind-hand slackness! Welcome hither, As is the spring to the earth. And hath he too Expos’d this paragon to the fearful usage, At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune, To greet a man not worth her pains, much less Th’ adventure of her person?  FLORIZEL. Good, my lord, She came from Libya.  LEONTES. Where the warlike Smalus, That noble honour’d lord, is fear’d and lov’d?  FLORIZEL. Most royal sir, from thence; from him, whose daughter His tears proclaim’d his, parting with her: thence, A prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross’d, To execute the charge my father gave me For visiting your highness: my best train I have from your Sicilian shores dismiss’d; Who for Bohemia bend, to signify Not only my success in Libya, sir, But my arrival, and my wife’s, in safety Here, where we are.  LEONTES. The blessed gods Purge all infection from our air whilst you Do climate here! You have a holy father, A graceful gentleman; against whose person, So sacred as it is, I have done sin, For which the heavens, taking angry note, Have left me issueless. And your father’s bless’d, As he from heaven merits it, with you, Worthy his goodness. What might I have been, Might I a son and daughter now have look’d on, Such goodly things as you!   Enter a Lord.  LORD. Most noble sir, That which I shall report will bear no credit, Were not the proof so nigh. Please you, great sir, Bohemia greets you from himself by me; Desires you to attach his son, who has— His dignity and duty both cast off— Fled from his father, from his hopes, and with A shepherd’s daughter.  LEONTES. Where’s Bohemia? speak.  LORD. Here in your city; I now came from him. I speak amazedly, and it becomes My marvel and my message. To your court Whiles he was hast’ning—in the chase, it seems, Of this fair couple—meets he on the way The father of this seeming lady and Her brother, having both their country quitted With this young prince.  FLORIZEL. Camillo has betray’d me; Whose honour and whose honesty till now, Endur’d all weathers.  LORD. Lay ’t so to his charge. He’s with the king your father.  LEONTES. Who? Camillo?  LORD. Camillo, sir; I spake with him; who now Has these poor men in question. Never saw I Wretches so quake: they kneel, they kiss the earth; Forswear themselves as often as they speak. Bohemia stops his ears, and threatens them With divers deaths in death.  PERDITA. O my poor father! The heaven sets spies upon us, will not have Our contract celebrated.  LEONTES. You are married?  FLORIZEL. We are not, sir, nor are we like to be. The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first. The odds for high and low’s alike.  LEONTES. My lord, Is this the daughter of a king?  FLORIZEL. She is, When once she is my wife.  LEONTES. That “once”, I see by your good father’s speed, Will come on very slowly. I am sorry, Most sorry, you have broken from his liking, Where you were tied in duty; and as sorry Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty, That you might well enjoy her.  FLORIZEL. Dear, look up: Though Fortune, visible an enemy, Should chase us with my father, power no jot Hath she to change our loves. Beseech you, sir, Remember since you ow’d no more to time Than I do now: with thought of such affections, Step forth mine advocate. At your request My father will grant precious things as trifles.  LEONTES. Would he do so, I’d beg your precious mistress, Which he counts but a trifle.  PAULINA. Sir, my liege, Your eye hath too much youth in ’t: not a month ’Fore your queen died, she was more worth such gazes Than what you look on now.  LEONTES. I thought of her Even in these looks I made. [_To Florizel._] But your petition Is yet unanswer’d. I will to your father. Your honour not o’erthrown by your desires, I am friend to them and you: upon which errand I now go toward him; therefore follow me, And mark what way I make. Come, good my lord.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. The same. Before the Palace.   Enter Autolycus and a Gentleman.  AUTOLYCUS. Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?  FIRST GENTLEMAN. I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old shepherd deliver the manner how he found it: whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all commanded out of the chamber; only this, methought I heard the shepherd say he found the child.  AUTOLYCUS. I would most gladly know the issue of it.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. I make a broken delivery of the business; but the changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were very notes of admiration. They seemed almost, with staring on one another, to tear the cases of their eyes. There was speech in their dumbness, language in their very gesture; they looked as they had heard of a world ransomed, or one destroyed. A notable passion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest beholder, that knew no more but seeing could not say if th’ importance were joy or sorrow; but in the extremity of the one, it must needs be. Here comes a gentleman that happily knows more.   Enter a Gentleman.  The news, Rogero?  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled: the king’s daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is broken out within this hour that ballad-makers cannot be able to express it. Here comes the Lady Paulina’s steward: he can deliver you more.   Enter a third Gentleman.   How goes it now, sir? This news, which is called true, is so like an  old tale that the verity of it is in strong suspicion. Has the king  found his heir?  THIRD GENTLEMAN. Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by circumstance. That which you hear you’ll swear you see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle of Queen Hermione’s, her jewel about the neck of it, the letters of Antigonus found with it, which they know to be his character; the majesty of the creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding, and many other evidences proclaim her with all certainty to be the king’s daughter. Did you see the meeting of the two kings?  SECOND GENTLEMAN. No.  THIRD GENTLEMAN. Then you have lost a sight which was to be seen, cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one joy crown another, so and in such manner that it seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes, holding up of hands, with countenance of such distraction that they were to be known by garment, not by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that joy were now become a loss, cries “O, thy mother, thy mother!” then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his daughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten conduit of many kings’ reigns. I never heard of such another encounter, which lames report to follow it, and undoes description to do it.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried hence the child?  THIRD GENTLEMAN. Like an old tale still, which will have matter to rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear open. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this avouches the shepherd’s son, who has not only his innocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. What became of his bark and his followers?  THIRD GENTLEMAN. Wrecked the same instant of their master’s death, and in the view of the shepherd: so that all the instruments which aided to expose the child were even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble combat that ’twixt joy and sorrow was fought in Paulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of her husband, another elevated that the oracle was fulfilled. She lifted the princess from the earth, and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin her to her heart, that she might no more be in danger of losing.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. The dignity of this act was worth the audience of kings and princes; for by such was it acted.  THIRD GENTLEMAN. One of the prettiest touches of all, and that which angled for mine eyes (caught the water, though not the fish) was, when at the relation of the queen’s death (with the manner how she came to it bravely confessed and lamented by the king) how attentiveness wounded his daughter; till, from one sign of dolour to another, she did, with an “Alas,” I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my heart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed colour; some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the world could have seen it, the woe had been universal.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Are they returned to the court?  THIRD GENTLEMAN. No: the princess hearing of her mother’s statue, which is in the keeping of Paulina,—a piece many years in doing and now newly performed by that rare Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself eternity, and could put breath into his work, would beguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her ape: he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of answer. Thither with all greediness of affection are they gone, and there they intend to sup.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. I thought she had some great matter there in hand; for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever since the death of Hermione, visited that removed house. Shall we thither, and with our company piece the rejoicing?  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Who would be thence that has the benefit of access? Every wink of an eye some new grace will be born. Our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge. Let’s along.   [_Exeunt Gentlemen._]  AUTOLYCUS. Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me, would preferment drop on my head. I brought the old man and his son aboard the prince; told him I heard them talk of a fardel and I know not what. But he at that time over-fond of the shepherd’s daughter (so he then took her to be), who began to be much sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of weather continuing, this mystery remained undiscover’d. But ’tis all one to me; for had I been the finder-out of this secret, it would not have relish’d among my other discredits.   Enter Shepherd and Clown.  Here come those I have done good to against my will, and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune.  SHEPHERD. Come, boy; I am past more children, but thy sons and daughters will be all gentlemen born.  CLOWN. You are well met, sir. You denied to fight with me this other day, because I was no gentleman born. See you these clothes? Say you see them not and think me still no gentleman born: you were best say these robes are not gentlemen born. Give me the lie, do; and try whether I am not now a gentleman born.  AUTOLYCUS. I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.  CLOWN. Ay, and have been so any time these four hours.  SHEPHERD. And so have I, boy!  CLOWN. So you have: but I was a gentleman born before my father; for the king’s son took me by the hand and called me brother; and then the two kings called my father brother; and then the prince, my brother, and the princess, my sister, called my father father; and so we wept; and there was the first gentleman-like tears that ever we shed.  SHEPHERD. We may live, son, to shed many more.  CLOWN. Ay; or else ’twere hard luck, being in so preposterous estate as we are.  AUTOLYCUS. I humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the faults I have committed to your worship, and to give me your good report to the prince my master.  SHEPHERD. Prithee, son, do; for we must be gentle, now we are gentlemen.  CLOWN. Thou wilt amend thy life?  AUTOLYCUS. Ay, an it like your good worship.  CLOWN. Give me thy hand: I will swear to the prince thou art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia.  SHEPHERD. You may say it, but not swear it.  CLOWN. Not swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors and franklins say it, I’ll swear it.  SHEPHERD. How if it be false, son?  CLOWN. If it be ne’er so false, a true gentleman may swear it in the behalf of his friend. And I’ll swear to the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be drunk: but I’ll swear it; and I would thou wouldst be a tall fellow of thy hands.  AUTOLYCUS. I will prove so, sir, to my power.  CLOWN. Ay, by any means, prove a tall fellow: if I do not wonder how thou dar’st venture to be drunk, not being a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark! the kings and the princes, our kindred, are going to see the queen’s picture. Come, follow us: we’ll be thy good masters.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. The same. A Room in Paulina’s house.   Enter Leontes, Polixenes, Florizel, Perdita, Camillo, Paulina, Lords  and Attendants.  LEONTES. O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort That I have had of thee!  PAULINA. What, sovereign sir, I did not well, I meant well. All my services You have paid home: but that you have vouchsaf’d, With your crown’d brother and these your contracted Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit, It is a surplus of your grace which never My life may last to answer.  LEONTES. O Paulina, We honour you with trouble. But we came To see the statue of our queen: your gallery Have we pass’d through, not without much content In many singularities; but we saw not That which my daughter came to look upon, The statue of her mother.  PAULINA. As she liv’d peerless, So her dead likeness, I do well believe, Excels whatever yet you look’d upon Or hand of man hath done; therefore I keep it Lonely, apart. But here it is: prepare To see the life as lively mock’d as ever Still sleep mock’d death. Behold, and say ’tis well.   Paulina undraws a curtain, and discovers Hermione standing as a  statue.  I like your silence, it the more shows off Your wonder: but yet speak. First you, my liege. Comes it not something near?  LEONTES. Her natural posture! Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she In thy not chiding; for she was as tender As infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina, Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing So aged as this seems.  POLIXENES. O, not by much!  PAULINA. So much the more our carver’s excellence, Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her As she liv’d now.  LEONTES. As now she might have done, So much to my good comfort as it is Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood, Even with such life of majesty, warm life, As now it coldly stands, when first I woo’d her! I am asham’d: does not the stone rebuke me For being more stone than it? O royal piece, There’s magic in thy majesty, which has My evils conjur’d to remembrance and From thy admiring daughter took the spirits, Standing like stone with thee.  PERDITA. And give me leave, And do not say ’tis superstition, that I kneel, and then implore her blessing. Lady, Dear queen, that ended when I but began, Give me that hand of yours to kiss.  PAULINA. O, patience! The statue is but newly fix’d, the colour’s Not dry.  CAMILLO. My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on, Which sixteen winters cannot blow away, So many summers dry. Scarce any joy Did ever so long live; no sorrow But kill’d itself much sooner.  POLIXENES. Dear my brother, Let him that was the cause of this have power To take off so much grief from you as he Will piece up in himself.  PAULINA. Indeed, my lord, If I had thought the sight of my poor image Would thus have wrought you—for the stone is mine— I’d not have show’d it.  LEONTES. Do not draw the curtain.  PAULINA. No longer shall you gaze on’t, lest your fancy May think anon it moves.  LEONTES. Let be, let be. Would I were dead, but that methinks already— What was he that did make it? See, my lord, Would you not deem it breath’d? And that those veins Did verily bear blood?  POLIXENES. Masterly done: The very life seems warm upon her lip.  LEONTES. The fixture of her eye has motion in ’t, As we are mock’d with art.  PAULINA. I’ll draw the curtain: My lord’s almost so far transported that He’ll think anon it lives.  LEONTES. O sweet Paulina, Make me to think so twenty years together! No settled senses of the world can match The pleasure of that madness. Let ’t alone.  PAULINA. I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr’d you: but I could afflict you further.  LEONTES. Do, Paulina; For this affliction has a taste as sweet As any cordial comfort. Still methinks There is an air comes from her. What fine chisel Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me, For I will kiss her!  PAULINA. Good my lord, forbear: The ruddiness upon her lip is wet; You’ll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?  LEONTES. No, not these twenty years.  PERDITA. So long could I Stand by, a looker on.  PAULINA. Either forbear, Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you For more amazement. If you can behold it, I’ll make the statue move indeed, descend, And take you by the hand. But then you’ll think (Which I protest against) I am assisted By wicked powers.  LEONTES. What you can make her do I am content to look on: what to speak, I am content to hear; for ’tis as easy To make her speak as move.  PAULINA. It is requir’d You do awake your faith. Then all stand still; Or those that think it is unlawful business I am about, let them depart.  LEONTES. Proceed: No foot shall stir.  PAULINA. Music, awake her: strike! [_Music._] ’Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach; Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come; I’ll fill your grave up: stir; nay, come away. Bequeath to death your numbness, for from him Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs.   Hermione comes down from the pedestal.  Start not; her actions shall be holy as You hear my spell is lawful. Do not shun her Until you see her die again; for then You kill her double. Nay, present your hand: When she was young you woo’d her; now in age Is she become the suitor?  LEONTES. [_Embracing her._] O, she’s warm! If this be magic, let it be an art Lawful as eating.  POLIXENES. She embraces him.  CAMILLO. She hangs about his neck. If she pertain to life, let her speak too.  POLIXENES. Ay, and make it manifest where she has liv’d, Or how stol’n from the dead.  PAULINA. That she is living, Were it but told you, should be hooted at Like an old tale; but it appears she lives, Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while. Please you to interpose, fair madam. Kneel And pray your mother’s blessing. Turn, good lady, Our Perdita is found.   [_Presenting Perdita who kneels to Hermione._]  HERMIONE. You gods, look down, And from your sacred vials pour your graces Upon my daughter’s head! Tell me, mine own, Where hast thou been preserv’d? where liv’d? how found Thy father’s court? for thou shalt hear that I, Knowing by Paulina that the oracle Gave hope thou wast in being, have preserv’d Myself to see the issue.  PAULINA. There’s time enough for that; Lest they desire upon this push to trouble Your joys with like relation. Go together, You precious winners all; your exultation Partake to everyone. I, an old turtle, Will wing me to some wither’d bough, and there My mate, that’s never to be found again, Lament till I am lost.  LEONTES. O peace, Paulina! Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent, As I by thine a wife: this is a match, And made between ’s by vows. Thou hast found mine; But how, is to be question’d; for I saw her, As I thought, dead; and have in vain said many A prayer upon her grave. I’ll not seek far— For him, I partly know his mind—to find thee An honourable husband. Come, Camillo, And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty Is richly noted, and here justified By us, a pair of kings. Let’s from this place. What! look upon my brother: both your pardons, That e’er I put between your holy looks My ill suspicion. This your son-in-law, And son unto the king, whom heavens directing, Is troth-plight to your daughter. Good Paulina, Lead us from hence; where we may leisurely Each one demand, and answer to his part Perform’d in this wide gap of time, since first We were dissever’d. Hastily lead away!   [_Exeunt._]

A LOVER’S COMPLAINT
  THE PASSIONATE PILGRIM
  I
When my love swears that she is made of truth, I do believe her, though I know she lies, That she might think me some untutor’d youth, Unskilful in the world’s false forgeries. Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young, Although I know my years be past the best, I smiling credit her false-speaking tongue, Outfacing faults in love with love’s ill rest. But wherefore says my love that she is young? And wherefore say not I that I am old? O, love’s best habit is a soothing tongue, And age, in love, loves not to have years told.     Therefore, I’ll lie with love, and love with me,     Since that our faults in love thus smother’d be.
  II
Two loves I have, of comfort and despair, That like two spirits do suggest me still; My better angel is a man right fair, My worser spirit a woman colour’d ill. To win me soon to hell, my female evil Tempteth my better angel from my side, And would corrupt my saint to be a devil, Wooing his purity with her fair pride. And whether that my angel be turn’d fiend, Suspect I may, yet not directly tell; For being both to me, both to each friend, I guess one angel in another’s hell:     The truth I shall not know, but live in doubt,     Till my bad angel fire my good one out.
  III
Did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye, ’Gainst whom the world could not hold argument, Persuade my heart to this false perjury? Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment. A woman I forswore; but I will prove, Thou being a goddess, I forswore not thee: My vow was earthly, thou a heavenly love; Thy grace being gain’d cures all disgrace in me. My vow was breath, and breath a vapour is; Then, thou fair sun, that on this earth doth shine, Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is; If broken then, it is no fault of mine.     If by me broke, what fool is not so wise     To break an oath, to win a paradise?
  IV
Sweet Cytherea, sitting by a brook With young Adonis, lovely, fresh and green, Did court the lad with many a lovely look, Such looks as none could look but beauty’s queen. She told him stories to delight his ear; She show’d him favours to allure his eye; To win his heart, she touch’d him here and there; Touches so soft still conquer chastity. But whether unripe years did want conceit, Or he refus’d to take her figur’d proffer, The tender nibbler would not touch the bait, But smile and jest at every gentle offer.     Then fell she on her back, fair queen, and toward:     He rose and ran away; ah, fool too froward!
  V
If love make me forsworn, how shall I swear to love? O never faith could hold, if not to beauty vowed. Though to myself forsworn, to thee I’ll constant prove; Those thoughts, to me like oaks, to thee like osiers bowed. Study his bias leaves, and makes his book thine eyes, Where all those pleasures live that art can comprehend. If knowledge be the mark, to know thee shall suffice; Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend, All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder; Which is to me some praise, that I thy parts admire. Thine eye Jove’s lightning seems, thy voice his dreadful thunder, Which, not to anger bent, is music and sweet fire.     Celestial as thou art, O do not love that wrong,     To sing heaven’s praise with such an earthly tongue.
  VI
Scarce had the sun dried up the dewy morn, And scarce the herd gone to the hedge for shade, When Cytherea, all in love forlorn, A longing tarriance for Adonis made Under an osier growing by a brook, A brook where Adon used to cool his spleen. Hot was the day; she hotter that did look For his approach, that often there had been. Anon he comes, and throws his mantle by, And stood stark naked on the brook’s green brim: The sun look’d on the world with glorious eye, Yet not so wistly as this queen on him.     He, spying her, bounc’d in, whereas he stood,     “O Jove,” quoth she, “why was not I a flood?”
  VII
Fair is my love, but not so fair as fickle, Mild as a dove, but neither true nor trusty, Brighter than glass, and yet, as glass is, brittle, Softer than wax, and yet, as iron, rusty:     A lily pale, with damask dye to grace her,     None fairer, nor none falser to deface her.  Her lips to mine how often hath she joined, Between each kiss her oaths of true love swearing! How many tales to please me hath she coined, Dreading my love, the loss thereof still fearing!     Yet in the midst of all her pure protestings,     Her faith, her oaths, her tears, and all were jestings.  She burnt with love, as straw with fire flameth; She burnt out love, as soon as straw out-burneth; She fram’d the love, and yet she foil’d the framing; She bade love last, and yet she fell a-turning.     Was this a lover, or a lecher whether?     Bad in the best, though excellent in neither.
  VIII
If music and sweet poetry agree, As they must needs, the sister and the brother, Then must the love be great ’twixt thee and me, Because thou lov’st the one and I the other. Dowland to thee is dear, whose heavenly touch Upon the lute doth ravish human sense; Spenser to me, whose deep conceit is such As passing all conceit, needs no defence. Thou lov’st to hear the sweet melodious sound That Phœbus’ lute, the queen of music, makes; And I in deep delight am chiefly drown’d Whenas himself to singing he betakes.     One god is god of both, as poets feign;     One knight loves both, and both in thee remain.
  IX
Fair was the morn when the fair queen of love,         *        *        *        *        *        * Paler for sorrow than her milk-white dove, For Adon’s sake, a youngster proud and wild; Her stand she takes upon a steep-up hill; Anon Adonis comes with horn and hounds; She, silly queen, with more than love’s good will, Forbade the boy he should not pass those grounds. “Once,” quoth she, “did I see a fair sweet youth Here in these brakes deep-wounded with a boar, Deep in the thigh, a spectacle of ruth! See in my thigh,” quoth she, “here was the sore.”     She showed hers: he saw more wounds than one,     And blushing fled, and left her all alone.
  X
Sweet rose, fair flower, untimely pluck’d, soon vaded, Pluck’d in the bud and vaded in the spring! Bright orient pearl, alack, too timely shaded! Fair creature, kill’d too soon by death’s sharp sting!     Like a green plum that hangs upon a tree,     And falls, through wind, before the fall should be.  I weep for thee, and yet no cause I have; For why thou left’st me nothing in thy will; And yet thou left’st me more than I did crave; For why I craved nothing of thee still.     O yes, dear friend, I pardon crave of thee,     Thy discontent thou didst bequeath to me.
  XI
Venus, with young Adonis sitting by her Under a myrtle shade, began to woo him; She told the youngling how god Mars did try her, And as he fell to her, she fell to him. “Even thus,” quoth she, “the warlike god embrac’d me,” And then she clipp’d Adonis in her arms; “Even thus,” quoth she, “the warlike god unlaced me;” As if the boy should use like loving charms; “Even thus,” quoth she, “he seized on my lips,” And with her lips on his did act the seizure; And as she fetched breath, away he skips, And would not take her meaning nor her pleasure.     Ah, that I had my lady at this bay,     To kiss and clip me till I run away!
  XII
Crabbed age and youth cannot live together: Youth is full of pleasance, age is full of care; Youth like summer morn, age like winter weather; Youth like summer brave, age like winter bare. Youth is full of sport, age’s breath is short;     Youth is nimble, age is lame; Youth is hot and bold, age is weak and cold;     Youth is wild, and age is tame. Age, I do abhor thee; youth, I do adore thee;     O, my love, my love is young! Age, I do defy thee. O, sweet shepherd, hie thee, For methinks thou stay’st too long.
  XIII
Beauty is but a vain and doubtful good, A shining gloss that vadeth suddenly; A flower that dies when first it ’gins to bud; A brittle glass that’s broken presently:     A doubtful good, a gloss, a glass, a flower,     Lost, vaded, broken, dead within an hour.  And as goods lost are seld or never found, As vaded gloss no rubbing will refresh, As flowers dead lie wither’d on the ground, As broken glass no cement can redress,     So beauty blemish’d once, for ever’s lost,     In spite of physic, painting, pain and cost.
  XIV
Good night, good rest. Ah, neither be my share: She bade good night that kept my rest away; And daff’d me to a cabin hang’d with care, To descant on the doubts of my decay.     “Farewell,” quoth she, “and come again tomorrow:”     Fare well I could not, for I supp’d with sorrow.  Yet at my parting sweetly did she smile, In scorn or friendship, nill I conster whether: ’T may be, she joy’d to jest at my exile, ’T may be, again to make me wander thither:     “Wander,” a word for shadows like myself,     As take the pain, but cannot pluck the pelf.  Lord, how mine eyes throw gazes to the east! My heart doth charge the watch; the morning rise Doth cite each moving sense from idle rest. Not daring trust the office of mine eyes,     While Philomela sits and sings, I sit and mark,     And wish her lays were tuned like the lark.  For she doth welcome daylight with her ditty, And drives away dark dreaming night. The night so pack’d, I post unto my pretty; Heart hath his hope and eyes their wished sight;     Sorrow chang’d to solace, solace mix’d with sorrow;     For why, she sigh’d, and bade me come tomorrow.  Were I with her, the night would post too soon; But now are minutes added to the hours; To spite me now, each minute seems a moon; Yet not for me, shine sun to succour flowers!     Pack night, peep day; good day, of night now borrow:     Short, night, tonight, and length thyself tomorrow.
  XV
It was a lording’s daughter, the fairest one of three, That liked of her master as well as well might be, Till looking on an Englishman, the fairest that eye could see,     Her fancy fell a-turning. Long was the combat doubtful, that love with love did fight, To leave the master loveless, or kill the gallant knight; To put in practice either, alas, it was a spite     Unto the silly damsel! But one must be refused; more mickle was the pain, That nothing could be used to turn them both to gain, For of the two the trusty knight was wounded with disdain:     Alas she could not help it! Thus art with arms contending was victor of the day, Which by a gift of learning did bear the maid away: Then lullaby, the learned man hath got the lady gay;     For now my song is ended.
  XVI
On a day, alack the day! Love, whose month was ever May, Spied a blossom passing fair, Playing in the wanton air. Through the velvet leaves the wind All unseen ’gan passage find, That the lover, sick to death, Wish’d himself the heaven’s breath: “Air,” quoth he, “thy cheeks may blow; Air, would I might triumph so! But, alas, my hand hath sworn Ne’er to pluck thee from thy thorn: Vow, alack, for youth unmeet, Youth, so apt to pluck a sweet! Thou for whom Jove would swear Juno but an Ethiope were, And deny himself for Jove, Turning mortal for thy love.”
  XVII
My flocks feed not, my ewes breed not, My rams speed not, all is amis: Love is dying, faith’s defying, Heart’s denying, causer of this. All my merry jigs are quite forgot, All my lady’s love is lost, God wot: Where her faith was firmely fix’d in love, There a nay is plac’d without remove. One silly cross wrought all my loss; O frowning fortune, cursed fickle dame! For now I see inconstancy More in women than in men remain.  In black mourn I, all fears scorn I, Love hath forlorn me, living in thrall. Heart is bleeding, all help needing, O cruel speeding, fraughted with gall. My shepherd’s pipe can sound no deal. My weather’s bell rings doleful knell; My curtal dog that wont to have play’d, Plays not at all, but seems afraid. With sighs so deep procures to weep, In howling wise, to see my doleful plight. How sighs resound through heartless ground, Like a thousand vanquish’d men in bloody fight!  Clear wells spring not, sweet birds sing not, Green plants bring not forth their dye; Herds stands weeping, flocks all sleeping, Nymphs black peeping fearfully. All our pleasure known to us poor swains, All our merry meetings on the plains, All our evening sport from us is fled, All our love is lost, for love is dead. Farewel, sweet love, thy like ne’er was For a sweet content, the cause of all my woe! Poor Corydon must live alone; Other help for him I see that there is none.
  XVIII
Whenas thine eye hath chose the dame, And stall’d the deer that thou shouldst strike, Let reason rule things worthy blame, As well as fancy, partial might;     Take counsel of some wiser head,     Neither too young nor yet unwed.  And when thou com’st thy tale to tell, Smooth not thy tongue with filed talk, Least she some subtle practice smell,— A cripple soon can find a halt,—     But plainly say thou lov’st her well,     And set her person forth to sale.  What though her frowning brows be bent, Her cloudy looks will calm ere night, And then too late she will repent, That thus dissembled her delight;     And twice desire, ere it be day,     That which with scorn she put away.  What though she strive to try her strength, And ban and brawl, and say thee nay, Her feeble force will yield at length, When craft hath taught her thus to say:     “Had women been so strong as men,     In faith, you had not had it then.”  And to her will frame all thy ways; Spare not to spend, and chiefly there Where thy desert may merit praise, By ringing in thy lady’s ear:     The strongest castle, tower and town,     The golden bullet beats it down.  Serve always with assured trust, And in thy suit be humble true; Unless thy lady prove unjust, Press never thou to choose a new:     When time shall serve, be thou not slack,     To proffer, though she put thee back.  The wiles and guiles that women work, Dissembled with an outward show, The tricks and toys that in them lurk, The cock that treads them shall not know,     Have you not heard it said full oft,     A woman’s nay doth stand for nought.  Think women still to strive with men, To sin and never for to saint: There is no heaven, by holy then, When time with age shall them attaint,     Were kisses all the joys in bed,     One woman would another wed.  But soft, enough,—too much,—I fear Lest that my mistress hear my song: She will not stick to round me on th’ ear, To teach my tongue to be so long.     Yet will she blush, here be it said,     To hear her secrets so bewray’d.
  XIX
Live with me and be my love, And we will all the pleasures prove That hills and valleys, dales and fields, And all the craggy mountains yield.  There will we sit upon the rocks, And see the shepherds feed their flocks, By shallow rivers, by whose falls Melodious birds sing madrigals.  There will I make thee a bed of roses, With a thousand fragrant posies, A cap of flowers, and a kirtle Embroidered all with leaves of myrtle.  A belt of straw and ivy buds, With coral clasps and amber studs; And if these pleasures may thee move, Then live with me and be my love.  Love’s Answer.  If that the world and love were young, And truth in every shepherd’s tongue, These pretty pleasures might me move To live with thee and be thy love.
  XX
  THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE
Let the bird of loudest lay, On the sole Arabian tree, Herald sad and trumpet be, To whose sound chaste wings obey.  But thou shrieking harbinger, Foul precurrer of the fiend, Augur of the fever’s end, To this troop come thou not near.  From this session interdict Every fowl of tyrant wing, Save the eagle, feather’d king; Keep the obsequy so strict.  Let the priest in surplice white, That defunctive music can, Be the death-divining swan, Lest the requiem lack his right.  And thou treble-dated crow, That thy sable gender mak’st With the breath thou giv’st and tak’st, ’Mongst our mourners shalt thou go.  Here the anthem doth commence: Love and constancy is dead; Phoenix and the turtle fled In a mutual flame from hence.  So they lov’d, as love in twain Had the essence but in one; Two distincts, division none: Number there in love was slain.  Hearts remote, yet not asunder; Distance and no space was seen ’Twixt this turtle and his queen; But in them it were a wonder.  So between them love did shine, That the turtle saw his right Flaming in the phoenix’ sight; Either was the other’s mine.  Property was thus appalled, That the self was not the same; Single nature’s double name Neither two nor one was called.  Reason, in itself confounded, Saw division grow together; To themselves yet either neither, Simple were so well compounded.  That it cried, How true a twain Seemeth this concordant one! Love hath reason, reason none, If what parts can so remain.  Whereupon it made this threne To the phoenix and the dove, Co-supremes and stars of love, As chorus to their tragic scene.
  THE RAPE OF LUCRECE
TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE HENRY WRIOTHESLEY, EARL OF SOUTHAMPTON, and Baron of Titchfield.  The love I dedicate to your Lordship is without end; whereof this pamphlet, without beginning, is but a superfluous moiety. The warrant I have of your honourable disposition, not the worth of my untutored lines, makes it assured of acceptance. What I have done is yours; what I have to do is yours; being part in all I have, devoted yours. Were my worth greater, my duty would show greater; meantime, as it is, it is bound to your Lordship, to whom I wish long life, still lengthened with all happiness.                             Your Lordship’s in all duty,                                 WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE.
  THE ARGUMENT.
Lucius Tarquinius (for his excessive pride surnamed Superbus), after he had caused his own father-in-law, Servius Tullius, to be cruelly murdered, and, contrary to the Roman laws and customs, not requiring or staying for the people’s suffrages, had possessed himself of the kingdom, went, accompanied with his sons and other noblemen of Rome, to besiege Ardea. During which siege the principal men of the army meeting one evening at the tent of Sextus Tarquinius, the king’s son, in their discourses after supper, everyone commended the virtues of his own wife; among whom Collatinus extolled the incomparable chastity of his wife Lucretia. In that pleasant humour they all posted to Rome; and intending, by their secret and sudden arrival, to make trial of that which everyone had before avouched, only Collatinus finds his wife, though it were late in the night, spinning amongst her maids: the other ladies were all found dancing and revelling, or in several disports. Whereupon the noblemen yielded Collatinus the victory, and his wife the fame. At that time Sextus Tarquinius being inflamed with Lucrece’s beauty, yet smothering his passions for the present, departed with the rest back to the camp; from whence he shortly after privily withdrew himself, and was (according to his estate) royally entertained and lodged by Lucrece at Collatium. The same night he treacherously stealeth into her chamber, violently ravished her, and early in the morning speedeth away. Lucrece, in this lamentable plight, hastily dispatched messengers, one to Rome for her father, another to the camp for Collatine. They came, the one accompanied with Junius Brutus, the other with Publius Valerius; and finding Lucrece attired in mourning habit, demanded the cause of her sorrow. She, first taking an oath of them for her revenge, revealed the actor, and whole manner of his dealing, and withal suddenly stabbed herself. Which done, with one consent they all vowed to root out the whole hated family of the Tarquins; and bearing the dead body to Rome, Brutus acquainted the people with the doer and manner of the vile deed, with a bitter invective against the tyranny of the king; wherewith the people were so moved, that with one consent and a general acclamation the Tarquins were all exiled, and the state government changed from kings to consuls.
  VENUS AND ADONIS
             _Vilia miretur vulgus; mihi flavus Apollo             Pocula Castalia plena ministret aqua._
  TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE HENRY WRIOTHESLEY,  EARL OF SOUTHAMPTON, and Baron of Titchfield.  Right Honourable, I know not how I shall offend in dedicating my unpolished lines to your lordship, nor how the world will censure me for choosing so strong a prop to support so weak a burthen: only, if your honour seem but pleased, I account myself highly praised, and vow to take advantage of all idle hours, till I have honoured you with some graver labour. But if the first heir of my invention prove deformed, I shall be sorry it had so noble a godfather, and never after ear so barren a land, for fear it yield me still so bad a harvest. I leave it to your honourable survey, and your honour to your heart’s content; which I wish may always answer your own wish and the world’s hopeful expectation.  Your honour’s in all duty, WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE.
