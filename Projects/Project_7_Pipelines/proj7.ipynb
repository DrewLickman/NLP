    "# Project Description\n",
    "This project is used to analyze the transcripts of the Federal Open Market Committees (FOMC)\n",
    "\n",
    "Takes about 30 minutes to run the entire program\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem:\n",
    "I chose this project because I believe it is important for people to get a quick and easy-to-understand analysis of the FOMC meetings. The FOMC \"reviews economic and financial conditions, determines the appropriate stance of monetary policy, and assesses the risks to its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth\" (https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Dataset:\n",
    "The dataset I used is the FOMC transcripts from each of their meetings. I created (with Claude 3.5 Sonnet (New)) a web scraper to read the FOMC website and download the PDFs\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution:\n",
    "[1.](#web-scraping) Download PDF transcripts from the official FOMC website using `fomc-crawler.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "[2.](#Conversion) Convert the PDFs to text files with `pdf-to-txt.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "[3.](#BERT-based-Sentiment-Analysis) Utilize a slightly modified version of tabularisai's robust-sentiment-analysis (distil)BERT-based Sentiment Classification Model `https://huggingface.co/tabularisai/robust-sentiment-analysis` for sentiment analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "[4.](#Summarization) Summarize each document via pipeline of Falconsai's text_summarization Fine-Tuned T5 Small for Text Summarization Model `https://huggingface.co/Falconsai/text_summarization`\n",
    "\n",
    "[5.](#Question-Answering) Answer the question \"What is the current status of the economy?\" from each meeting by using consciousAI's question-answering-roberta-base-s-v2 for Question Answering `https://huggingface.co/consciousAI/question-answering-roberta-base-s-v2`\n",
